Invoking Churchill’s <a href="https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/disaster-of-the-first-magnitude.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism of his predecessor</a> as prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, for reaching a deal with Hitler, Mr. Goff appeared to make a wry allusion to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-putin.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s embrace</a> of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-comments.html" title="">falsely suggested</a> that Ukraine, not Mr. Putin, is responsible for the war.</p><p>But Ms. Valtonen deflected, saying that Churchill had “made very timeless remarks.”</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, described Mr. Goff’s remarks as “deeply disappointing” and said that they made his position “untenable.”</p><p>“When you’re in that position, you represent the government and the policies of the day,” Mr. Peters told reporters in New Zealand after summarily dismissing Mr. Goff. “You’re not able to free think — you are the face of New Zealand.”</p><p>Mr. Goff is a longtime politician and the former mayor of Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city. He was <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/next-high-commissioner-united-kingdom" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appointed to the London post in 2022</a> under Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/world/asia/jacinda-ardern-election-new-zealand.html" title="">championed as a leading liberal voice</a> against Mr. Trump in his first administration. But New Zealand’s politics have since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/asia/new-zealand-conservative-maori-protest.html" title="">shifted sharply</a>, with voters electing its most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/world/asia/new-zealand-election-national-wins.html" title="">conservative government in decades</a>.</p><p>Mr. Peters said that Mr. Goff’s removal was not about the U.S. government, but about conduct as a diplomat. “If he had made that comment about Germany, France, Tonga or Samoa, I’d have been forced to take this action,” Mr. Peters said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Nevertheless, it reflected how touchy U.S. allies are becoming in trying to stay in Mr. Trump’s good graces. When <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/christopher-luxon-trusts-donald-trump-believes-united-states-still-reliable-after-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-blow-up/Z7J76GPZKFGBJDQAUQJB4BFREM/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporters asked New Zealand’s prime minister, Christopher Luxon</a>, about Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-putin.html" title="">Oval Office confrontation</a> with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, he appeared to refrain from criticizing Mr. Trump. He went on to say that he still trusted Mr. Trump as an ally.</p><p>In recent months, Australia’s ambassador to the United States, Kevin Rudd, has also faced questions about whether he could continue in the job over his scathing past criticism of Mr. Trump. The comments were made before Mr. Rudd’s appointment to the position.</p><p>The Australian government backed Mr. Rudd, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/world/australia/australia-ambassador-trump-tweets-kevin-rudd.html" title="">deleted the critical posts</a> from his X account. He later said in a statement that he did not want them to be construed as reflecting the views of Australia’s government.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
