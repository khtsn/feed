Clean and bright, they are stocked with fresh and affordable lunchboxes, steamed buns and stews in the winter. The celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain once called them “the one vice” he couldn’t give up.</p><p>For many residents, the more than 55,000 cheerful, jingle-filled stores, known as konbini, are an indispensable part of daily life. Millions flock to the stores daily to pick up food, send packages and pay bills.</p><p>Japan’s largest konbini chain, 7-Eleven, is also its most famous. It is understandable that a rival company wants in on the action.</p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/business/7-11-7-i-couche-tard-circle-k.html" title="">Seven &amp; i Holdings</a>, the Japanese company that operates 7-Eleven, said it had received an unsolicited takeover proposal from Alimentation Couche-Tard, a convenience store giant in Canada.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The status of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/business/7-eleven-franchisee-court.html" title="">7-Eleven stores</a> as a cornerstone of Japanese society also means Japan probably will not be willing to part with them, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/japan-yen-nikkei-stocks.html" title="">increasing pressure</a> on the nation’s corporations to demonstrate openness to foreign-led acquisitions.</p><p>7-Eleven is “one of the best brick-and-mortar retail businesses in the world,” said Hiroaki Watanabe, an independent retail analyst. Selling 7-Eleven to Couche-Tard would be, for Japan, “equivalent to Toyota becoming a foreign company,” he said.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Part of what distinguishes Japan’s 7-Eleven stores from convenience stores in America is the selection of fresh food on the shelves.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noriko Hayashi/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>In fact, 7-Eleven started out an American convenience store chain, operated by Southland Corporation, in Dallas in 1927. It opened its first store in Japan in 1974, featuring popular American items like hamburgers. It was an instant success in Japan and within two years had expanded to 100 stores.</p><p>In 1991, a Japanese supermarket operator, Ito-Yokado, and 7-Eleven Japan acquired 70 percent of Southland’s shares. In 2005, 7-Eleven became wholly Japanese-owned through a holding company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/business/masatoshi-ito-dead.html" title="">Seven &amp; i</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Today, Seven &amp; i has more than 21,000 7-Eleven stores in Japan and operates in 20 countries and territories. In the United States, Seven &amp; i has been exploring ways to replicate the much-coveted Japanese convenience store experience. One possibility: Introduce ramen noodles.</p><p>In contrast to Japanese konbini stores, North American <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/business/truck-stops-electric-vehicles.html" title="">convenience stores</a> are often seen as places for packaged snacks, drinks and, in many cases, gasoline. Convenience-store hot foods typically evoke images of a solitary hot dog spinning for hours on end in an induction oven.</p><p>Couche-Tard, based in Quebec, operates many of these convenience stores in the United States under its Circle K brand.</p><p>The company runs more than 16,000 stores and gas stations in North America and Europe. Like Seven &amp; i, the Canadian retailer has sought further growth abroad. In 2021, it tried to acquire the French grocery store operator Carrefour — an effort that regulators eventually shot down.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Couche-Tard, a Canadian retailer, operates Circle K stores in the United States.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Japan has long been a part of Couche-Tard’s global ambitions. Should Couche-Tard’s acquisition succeed, it would not only represent the largest foreign-led acquisition of a Japanese company but also create one of the world’s largest retail groups.</p></div><div><div><p>After news of Couche-Tard’s preliminary takeover bid, Seven &amp; i announced that it had established an independent special committee to review the offer.</p><p>Analysts point to significant obstacles that would probably make the buyout of Seven &amp; i a long shot.</p><p>For one, Seven &amp; i is a conglomerate with businesses beyond convenience stores, including banking and carrier services. The holding company’s reach opens the acquisition to more intense scrutiny from the Japanese government.</p><p>There are also big differences in the way Couche-Tard and Seven &amp; i operate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/business/data-tracking-real-estate.html" title="">convenience stores</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Japanese company that operates 7-Eleven recently introduced stores with over twice as many products as regular 7-Eleven stores.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Akio Kon/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Japanese konbini operators are known for their swift development of new products — such as themed goods available only during the fleeting cherry-blossom season. A typical convenience store in Japan offers about 3,000 products, 70 percent of which are replaced annually, according to Mr. Watanabe, the analyst.</p><p>A large portion of Seven &amp; i’s operating profit comes from its Japanese convenience stores, and Couche-Tard would need to present a compelling proposal showing how it could improve that core business, he said.</p><p>Mr. Watanabe once made a two-week drive across the United States, studying convenience stores along the way — and was unimpressed. Any takeover proposal for 7-Eleven would be challenging because Japanese convenience stores are “completely different and unique,” he said.</p><p>The first 7-Eleven store in Japan opened in 1974 in a quiet bayside neighborhood in eastern Tokyo. On Friday morning, it was bustling with office workers, students and parents with young children in tow.</p><p>Sakura Kobayashi, 23, who works in the neighborhood, stopped in to buy a salad and an <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025414-salmon-onigiri" title="">onigiri rice ball</a> — a specialty in Japanese convenience stores. The foods at 7-Eleven have a taste that feels “familiar” to her and her colleagues, she said.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first 7-Eleven store in Japan opened in Tokyo in 1974.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Seven &amp; i Holdings</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The same store location in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kyodo News Stills, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>Outside a 7-Eleven in central<strong> </strong>Tokyo, Yuta Matsumura, a 26-year-old office worker, ate a cream-filled pancake dessert he had just bought.
