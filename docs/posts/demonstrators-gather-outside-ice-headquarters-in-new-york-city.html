They carried bright yellow signs that said “ICE out of NYC” in Spanish and English. Dozens of police officers in riot gear flanked the protesters in an apparent effort to facilitate traffic on Broadway, leading to the arrest of a handful of protesters.</p><p>As Mr. Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines to California, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who has largely aligned himself with Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, said on Tuesday that he did not foresee Mr. Trump’s sending the military to New York City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“If there’s ever a need to go beyond the manpower that we have, there’s other ways you do it before you have to come with the look of a military operation,” Mr. Adams said, citing the size and experience of New York City’s police force.</p><p>The rally on Tuesday evening appeared to be larger than the protests in New York during the past few days. While those earlier demonstrations were tense, resulting in arrests and small confrontations with law enforcement, they did not devolve into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/08/us/la-immigration-protests-photos-map.html" title="">the visceral scenes of chaos</a> that appeared episodically in Los Angeles.</p><p>While the protests there were largely peaceful, protesters and federal officers have engaged in violent clashes, with officers shooting flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets at protesters, who have thrown rocks, glass bottles and fireworks at the officers and have burned vehicles.</p><p>In New York, demonstrators have coalesced near 26 Federal Plaza, a 41-story federal building just a few blocks from City Hall with one of the city’s three immigration courts. Dozens of migrants showing up for hearings have been detained by federal agents at the courthouse this month, sparking pushback from Democrats and drawing activists to the building. The imposing skyscraper also houses the field office for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in New York.</p><p>On Tuesday, Andrea Montiel, 31, whose parents are Mexican immigrants, said she showed up at the rally on behalf of family and friends who she said were too worried about their immigration status to demonstrate publicly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I think we’re really here just because we hope we can make a difference and show ICE is not welcome,” she said, adding that New York and Los Angeles were connected by their large Hispanic populations. “We’re one community despite the distance.”</p><p>After speeches at the rally, which was organized by a coalition of unions and immigration groups, the crowd grew more disorganized as protesters, many of them masked, broke off to march on city streets, chanting “Abolish ICE.”</p><p>The first day of demonstrations in New York was Saturday, when more than 100 protesters gathered outside 26 Federal Plaza, where they clashed with police officers after the protesters tried to block ICE vehicles carrying detained migrants. The police said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/nyregion/ice-detention-federal-plaza-nyc.html" title="">22 people were taken into custody</a> as officers dispersed the crowd.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, quickly praised the Police Department’s response. “Thankfully, unlike in Los Angeles, the local police department quickly responded to the riots,” D.H.S. <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1931497488428532087" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>On Monday, after Mr. Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles, demonstrators took over the lobby of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, demanding the release of immigrants sent to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The Police Department <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/09/trump-tower-manhattan-ice-protest-arrests/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested at least 24 protesters</a> during that demonstration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Later in the day, as concerns mounted that the protests in New York could spiral out of control, Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/eric-adams-nypd-los-angeles-protests.html" title="">issued brief remarks</a> alongside Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch. The mayor said he respected the right of New Yorkers to protest peacefully but vowed that “we will not allow violence and lawlessness.”</p><p>“The escalation of protests in Los Angeles over the last couple of days is unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our city,” Mr. Adams said. Commissioner Tisch said that any attack against police officers would “be met by a swift and decisive response by the N.Y.P.D.”</p><p>The city leaders gave the remarks just as a disjointed group of 200 protesters gathered near 26 Federal Plaza for a “ICE out of NYC” demonstration on Monday evening, leading to <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/09/protesters-rage-at-ice-arrests-amid-heavy-police-presence-at-foley-square-in-lower-manhattan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven arrests</a>.</p><p>Cassidy Jensen<!-- -->, <!-- -->Samantha Latson<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ana Ley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Emmett Lindner<!-- --> and <!-- -->Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
