They have also repeatedly accused Hamas of diverting aid for its own fighters rather than allowing it to reach hungry Palestinian civilians, which Hamas denies.</p><h2 id="link-676aa8ea">What is Israel proposing?</h2><p>The Israeli military said that its coming escalation would involve the displacement of most of Gaza’s population to zones “clean of Hamas,” which would be filtered by Israeli forces to weed out any members of the militant group.</p><p>Under the new system, the Israeli military would secure and monitor the distribution of aid to Palestinians in a series of hubs inside Gaza, according to Israeli officials, diplomats and aid groups familiar with the proposal.</p><p>The United Nations and other aid groups have criticized the proposal and suggested they will not cooperate. And some critics in Israel fear the plan would bring the country one step closer to re-establishing Israeli military rule over Gaza — a dream of hard-liners on the Israeli right wing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Carrying food aid in Gaza City in February.

Israeli officials have generally briefed aid groups verbally to avoid putting their plan into writing, according to three officials familiar with the discussions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Sunday, the United Nations and a coalition of humanitarian groups said in a joint statement that Israeli officials were seeking to shut down the existing aid system and force aid groups to “deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military” once the government agreed to reopen the border crossings into Gaza.</p><p>Under the proposal, private companies would manage the delivery of aid within the hubs secured by Israeli forces, two Israeli officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p><h2 id="link-756702cb">What is the humanitarian situation in Gaza?</h2><p>When Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire in mid-January, Palestinians voiced hopes that they would at last enjoy a respite from the dire conditions in Gaza.</p><p>For more than a year, hundreds of thousands of Gazans displaced by the war had huddled in tents and makeshift shelters. Finding enough food and clean water was a daily struggle. Meager provisions were hawked in street markets at eye-watering prices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>During the truce, Israel agreed to allow hundreds of trucks of aid and commercial goods into Gaza each day, bearing fresh fruit, frozen meat, and enough flour to drive down the price of bread. But it didn’t last.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A truck loaded with humanitarian aid in Rafah, southern Gaza, in February.

Two weeks later, Israel ended the cease-fire with a massive bombardment across the territory.</p><p>The Israeli blockade has been in place for more than two months. Israeli officials say Gaza has enough provisions to last for some time, even as aid officials warn that the blockade could ultimately lead to famine.</p><p>“Blocking aid starves civilians. It leaves them without basic medical support. It strips them of dignity and hope,” Tom Fletcher, the top United Nations aid official, said in early May.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-2bb5604a">Why have aid groups criticized Israel’s proposal?</h2><p>Relief officials have said the Israeli plan would effectively leave much of Gaza — the parts of it without hubs — without any supplies. It would also essentially allow Israel to control the supply of critical aid and use it as leverage.</p><p>“It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic — as part of a military strategy,” the United Nations said in its joint statement with other humanitarian organizations.</p><p>The organizations also argued that if they agreed to provide aid in the Israeli military zones, they might effectively abet Israel’s forced mass displacement of Palestinians as part of the initiative.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
