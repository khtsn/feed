    <h1>World Bank Warns Colombian Staff Against U.S. Travel After Trump Visa Edict</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another Colombian staff member was not able to board a plane to the United States on Sunday afternoon, this person said.</p><p>Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he would impose sweeping tariffs, sanctions and immigration restrictions on Colombia because it rejected the military flights carrying deportees. The White House said later that day that the Colombian government had relented and that Mr. Trump would hold off on most of those measures. However, the visa restrictions remain in place.</p><p>“The visa sanctions issued by the State Department, and enhanced inspections from Customs and Border Protection, will remain in effect until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned” to Colombia, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Sunday evening.</p><p>Colombia’s foreign ministry <a href="https://x.com/CancilleriaCol/status/1883722303609127203" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a statement</a> soon afterward that said, “We have overcome the impasse with the United States government.” It said the government would accept all deportation flights and “guarantee dignified conditions” for those Colombians on board.</p></div></div>
