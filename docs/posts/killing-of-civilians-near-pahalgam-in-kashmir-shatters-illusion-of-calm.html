    <h1>Killing of Civilians Near Pahalgam in Kashmir Shatters Illusion of Calm</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>One day after militants killed 26 people in a tourist group in Kashmir, the Indian government on Wednesday pointed a finger at its archnemesis, Pakistan, announcing a series of punitive actions against its neighbor and hinting at further retaliation.</p><p>India has not officially blamed any group for the massacre, in which all but one of the dead were Indian citizens. But it described the aggressive moves outlined on Wednesday as a response to Pakistan’s support of terrorist attacks on Indian soil.</p><p>The Indian government suspended its participation in an important water treaty that since the 1960s has governed the flow of rivers that Pakistan’s irrigation system depends on. India declared a key land border between the two nations shut. And it announced that it was downgrading diplomatic ties, expelling Pakistan’s military advisers from the country’s New Delhi mission, and further restricting already-limited visas for Pakistani citizens.</p><p>The decision came at a cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as coffins of the civilians slaughtered in the picturesque Kashmir Valley began arriving to emotional scenes around the country. The prime minister was briefed on “the cross-border linkages of the terrorist attack,” said India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, without offering details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hours earlier, in the Indian government’s first public reaction, the defense minister, Rajnath Singh, said the country had “a zero-tolerance policy toward terrorism” and hinted at the possibility of military strikes.</p><p>“We will not only go after the perpetrators of this act,” he said, “but also the actors sitting behind the scenes drawing such conspiracies to be carried out on India’s soil.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23xp-kashmir-fzkt/23xp-kashmir-fzkt-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The attack took place in a picturesque valley popular with Indian travelers.

Kashmir, where Muslims are a majority, has found itself split between the two, with each country administering a part while laying claim to its whole.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="pahalgam-attack" data-id="100000010124985" data-source-id="100000010124985"><div slug="pahalgam-attack" data-sourceid="100000010124985" id="embed-id-100000010124985">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>India squarely blames Pakistan for harboring and supporting militants behind attacks like the one on Tuesday. In 2019, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/world/asia/kashmir-attack-pulwama.html" title="">a militant attack</a> that killed dozens of Indian security personnel resulted in an air battle between the nations that stopped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-airstrikes.html" title="">just short of all-out war</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The whole idea, I think, behind this attack was to sort of puncture that narrative that, you know, everything is fine,” said D.S. Hooda, a retired Indian army general who led Indian’s northern command based in Kashmir. <strong>“</strong>The government will be under tremendous pressure to react.”</p><p>General Hooda said the fact that the victims were civilians, and that witness accounts in Indian media suggested Hindus had been singled out by the militants, had only added to the pressure. A list of the victims circulating online, which was verified by local officials in Kashmir, showed that 25 of the 26 killed were Hindus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp/23INT-KASHMIR-ATTACK-01-cklp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/32501d4a-1e58-5a90-99b7-20fa15f58b2a" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The attack on Tuesday took place in a picturesque valley near the town of Pahalgam.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yawar Nazir/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The targeting of Hindus by militants in the 1990s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/world/asia/india-kashmir-hindu-pandits-attacks.html" title="">forced an exodus</a> of the minority community from Kashmir. In the apparently targeted killings on Tuesday, many saw reminders that the region still remains unsafe, particularly for Hindus, despite the government’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/world/asia/kashmir-india-tourism.html" title="">claim of a return to normalcy</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Pakistan has scheduled a meeting on Thursday of its National Security Committee, the country’s highest decision-making forum on security and foreign policy, as officials prepare a formal response to India’s flurry of steps.</p><p>Some news reports said that the Resistance Front, a little known and relatively new outfit in Kashmir, had claimed responsibility for the assault. An Indian security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said that security agencies’ assessment was that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/world/asia/lashkar-e-taiba-founder-takes-less-militant-tone-in-pakistan.html" title="">the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> was behind the attack, and that the Resistance Front was a proxy for that group.</p><p>Videos and images of the carnage flooded Indian media after the attack, showing tourists taking in the vast beauty at one moment and lying in pools of blood the next. One image showed a young woman in a tan jacket visibly distraught, kneeling down by the lifeless body of a man.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Funeral prayers in southern Kashmir for Adil Hussain Shah, a man killed in the attack on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Among the victims was Kaustubh Gunbote, 60, an avid traveler who ran a shop selling snacks in the western Indian city of Pune.

They were all made to lie down,” Mr. Gunbote said. “I feel frustrated and angry. The government says that this place is secure, but there was no security for miles around. My mother said that the terrorists came at leisure — strolling around and asking people their names.”</p><p>The attack took place as Vice President JD Vance and his family were in India on a four-day visit.

Security was tightened, with military helicopters surveilling the valley where the attack occurred. Tourists were also rushing to leave the region, with airlines adding flights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“It’s heartbreaking to see the exodus of our guests from the valley after yesterday’s tragic terror attack in Pahalgam,” said Omar Abdullah, Kashmir’s top elected official. “But at the same time, we totally understand why people would want to leave.”</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Modi had taken a two-pronged approach on Kashmir: ignore and isolate a Pakistan that was already teetering because of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/asia/pakistan-protests-politics.html" title="">own domestic problems</a>, and tighten security at home.</p><p>To isolate Pakistan, Mr. Modi has leaned into India’s growing economic and diplomatic power on the world stage. India has even kept Pakistani artists out of Bollywood and Pakistani athletes out of the Indian cricket league — hugely lucrative industries in the region.</p><p>Mr. Modi has previously raised the threat of restricting the water supply as a pressure tactic to get Pakistan’s establishment to stop using militants as proxies. About <a href="https://iwaponline.com/wp/article/23/6/1329/84494/Water-management-in-Pakistan-s-Indus-Basin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">90 percent of Pakistan’s food production</a> is dependent on water flowing through India from the Indus river system.</p><p>“Blood and water cannot flow together,” Mr. Modi warned at a meeting in 2016, soon after another terrorist attack, referring to coordination of the river flow to Pakistan. In 2019, the Indian government threatened to cut off the waters but did not follow through.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The funeral on Wednesday in Dombivali, India, of Sanjay Lele, who was killed in the attack.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Indranil Mukherjee/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>In 2019, Mr. Modi stripped Kashmir of the semi-autonomy it had enjoyed, and dissolved its local democracy to bring it under direct rule from New Delhi. </p><p>While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/world/asia/india-kashmir-hindu-pandits-attacks.html" title="">small-scale attacks</a> against civilians continued, Mr. Modi’s officials were increasingly projecting that their strategy was working. Kashmir had turned a page, they said, and it could focus on development. The main indicator of progress was the rising number of tourists pouring into the valley from around the country.</p><p>The mass-casualty attack on Tuesday has exposed the limits of that strategy.</p><p>In recent years, India has been preoccupied with a bigger threat on its northern border, as a more hawkish China in 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/indian-china-border-clash.html" title="">clashed with Indian forces</a> in the Himalayan region of Ladakh and encroached on Indian territory.</p><p>India and China’s militaries remained on a war footing for over four years, only disengaging recently. During that time, India tried to avoid the prospect of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/asia/india-military-china-pakistan.html" title="">a two-front conflict</a> by agreeing to a cease-fire along its boundary with Pakistan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>While diplomatic contact between India and Pakistan has remained minimal and infiltration of militants has continued into India, the cease-fire has largely held.</p><p>A speech last week by Pakistan’s army chief, Gen.

Addressing a gathering of overseas Pakistanis, General Munir,<span>  </span>spoke of Kashmir as “our jugular vein” and said “we will not leave our Kashmiri brethren in their heroic struggle that they are waging against Indian occupation.”</p><p>The comments have resurfaced on Indian television channels and social media since Tuesday’s attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The area of the valley where the attack took place on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NurPhoto, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Zia ur-Rehman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Showkat Nanda<!-- --> and <!-- -->Pragati K.B.<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.</p></div><div><p>Suhasini Raj is a reporter based in New Delhi who has covered India for The Times since 2014.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>India Punishes Pakistan After Slaughter of Kashmir Tourists <span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/23/world/asia/kashmir-attack-india-pakistan.html">43</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>False Claims and Global Aims: </strong>A Times investigation shows Therme, a European firm which runs a spa and water park in Romania, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/canada/therme-spa-ontario-canada.html">exaggerated its track record in securing a deal with Ontario</a>, and government auditors found that the process had been unfair and opaque.</p></li><li><p><strong>Odes to Mexican Drug Lords: </strong>Mexican artists built enormous audiences singing about drug cartels and narco culture. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/americas/mexico-narcocorridos-ban.html">Cities and states are now moving against the style</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Debate on Sex and Gender: </strong>President Trump and right-wing politicians in Europe have railed against trans rights. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/europe/uk-trans-hungary-germany-us.html">Britain’s top court has now added its voice to the discussion</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Santa’s Neighbors Are Annoyed: </strong>A tourist season in Rovaniemi, Finland that stretches from October to March has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/asia/santa-finland-rovaniemi.html">anything but jolly for some residents</a> of the “Official Hometown of Santa Claus.”</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
