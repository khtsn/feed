    <h1>As a Felon, Trump Upends How Americans View the Presidency</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A big economic package, mass deportations, maybe even some invasions of other countries. Oh, and one more item. “I’ll do my little thing tomorrow,” a busy President-elect Donald J. Trump mentioned the other night.</p><p>That little thing was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/nyregion/trump-hush-money-sentencing-convicted-felon.html" title="">the first criminal sentencing</a> of an American president. That little thing was confirmation that Mr. Trump, just 10 days later, would become the first president to move into the White House with a rap sheet. That little thing is the latest shift in standards that once governed high office.</p><p>Mr. Trump does not really consider it a little thing, of course, given how strenuously he sought to avoid Friday’s sentencing for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-convicted-hush-money-trial.html" title="">34 felony counts</a> in his hush money case. But to a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making it a little thing in the body politic. What was once a pretty-much-guaranteed disqualifier for the presidency is now just one more political event seen through a partisan lens.</p><p>After all, no one seemed shocked after Friday’s sentencing in New York. While Mr. Trump was spared jail time or financial penalties, he effectively had the word “felon” tattooed on his record for all time unless a higher court overturns the conviction. But that development was already baked into the system. Voters knew last fall that Mr. Trump had been found guilty by a jury of his peers, and enough of them decided it was either illegitimate or not as important as other issues.</p></div></div>
