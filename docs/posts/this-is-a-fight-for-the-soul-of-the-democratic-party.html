But by early Monday afternoon, only a fraction had shown up. The speakers were spirited, to be sure. But the park seemed half empty; a stack of signs depicting “Killer Kamala” and “Genocide Joe” — the ones that had freaky laser beams for eyes — lay unused in a pile in an empty corner of the park. It was not 1968.</p><p>Frank Chapman, an 81 year-old Marxist who is the dean of protest organizing in Chicago, conceded that Kamala Harris “may have taken some of the wind out of the sails” of marchers when she ascended to the top of the ticket. The Gaza protests have lost some momentum since the switch from President Biden.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean the battle over the soul of the Democratic Party has been called off. The party still faces a long-term moral quandary of how to square its rhetoric about being the party of freedom, equality and racial justice with the virtually unconditional support it has offered to a far-right government in Israel that is accused of starving and bombarding large numbers of civilians in Gaza since the brutal Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.</p><p>At the Democratic National Convention, some delegates are demanding a cease-fire and an end to the unconditional supply of arms to Israel. But they are being treated like the unwanted stepchildren at the family reunion. The party agreed to hold a human rights <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1DXGydzywqdKM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">panel</a> on Monday afternoon to highlight the suffering of Palestinians, but that didn’t feel like equal treatment. It wasn’t held on the main stage or during a prime time television slot, as the families of some of the hostages taken from Israel are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/dnc-democrats-israel-gaza.html" title="">expected to get</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, an American pediatric intensive care physician who recently worked in Gaza and spoke on the panel, told the audience not to celebrate her appearance at the event as a victory. Instead, she asked them to focus on policy changes — like the conditioning of military aid — that can save lives. “We have treated so many children who have lost their entire family that a term has been coined: W.C.W.N.S.F.” — wounded children with no surviving family, she said.</p><p>The truth is that Palestinians have been struggling for decades to have their full humanity recognized by American politicians, including those in the Democratic Party. Jim Zogby, a founder of the Arab American Institute, has been at it since the 1980s. For years, he said, candidates from both parties returned donations from Arab Americans and avoided being associated with Arab American organizers out of fear of offending pro-Israel groups.</p><p>Jesse Jackson was among the first to bring Arab Americans into the fold. They helped his Rainbow Coalition win a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/07/opinion/ten-days-that-shook-the-campaign.html" title="">surprise victory in the Michigan caucuses</a> in 1988. He garnered enough delegates at the convention in Atlanta that year to force a debate about U.S. policy in the Middle East. Mr. Zogby <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-07-20-mn-6064-story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made the case</a> that the Democratic platform should call for “mutual recognition, territorial compromise and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians.” Representative Chuck Schumer of New York forcefully rebutted him. A vote on the new language was never held, but simply hearing the word “Palestinian” uttered on the convention floor — “the P word,” Mr. Zogby called it — felt like a watershed moment.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>Yet stunningly little has changed since 1988. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s campaign was willing to adopt <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12281022/the-democratic-party-platform" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some of Senator Bernie Sanders’s views</a>, like support for a higher minimum wage and the legalization of marijuana, but didn’t budge on Israel and refused to allow the word “occupation” of the Palestinian territories to be included in the party platform, according to Matt Duss, a Middle East expert who later worked on the staff of Mr. Sanders.</p></div><div><div><p>“The same old people <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/herzogs-lullaby" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trot out the same old talking points</a>, representing an outdated view of Israel that is not only no longer accurate but it also doesn’t represent where Democratic Party voters are today,” Mr. Duss told me.</p><p>A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/472070/democrats-sympathies-middle-east-shift-palestinians.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gallup poll</a> in March 2023 showed, for the first time, that Democrats’ sympathies lie more with the Palestinians than the Israelis, a shift that happened gradually over the last decade.” That may be, in part, why Mr. Schumer, now the Senate majority leader, made his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/us/politics/schumer-netanyahu-israel-elections.html" title="">extraordinary speech</a> about Israel earlier this year, in which he called directly for a change in leadership. But for the most part, the way elected officials vote and talk about the conflict hasn’t kept up with Democratic voters’ sentiments.</p><p>That’s why there has been a concerted, but so far mostly thwarted, effort this year by delegates from the “uncommitted movement” to change the party from within. They say their demands for a cease-fire and an arms embargo are wildly popular with the Democratic base. It isn’t just a foreign policy issue, but one that goes to the heart of a social justice agenda.</p><p>“This is our fight for the soul of the Democratic Party,” Layla Elabed, a founder of the Uncommitted National Movement that convinced people to vote “uncommitted” in the Democratic primaries to pressure the party.</p><p>At their core, these “uncommitted” delegates are Democrats who believe in the system. At the end of the day, they don’t want to elect Donald Trump — <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-criticized-palestinian-insult-debate-with-biden-2024-06-28/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who</a> has used the word Palestinian as a slur and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html" title="">appears to have been ready to accept</a> the annexation of the West Bank.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Abbas Alawieh, also a founder of the Uncommitted National Movement, ticked off all the reasons that Mr. Trump would be a disaster for the Arab American community but said that it’s still important to hear Ms. Harris speak publicly about how she would be different. He’s giving her leeway, since she is not in charge yet. “Understanding that she is the vice president, and the president sets the policy right now, we need her to tell us how she plans to stop sending weapons to be used to kill civilians,” he said.</p><p>So far, there’s no indication that Ms. Harris will say any such thing. But after the human rights panel, Mr. Zogby was in good spirits, full of optimism about the party’s capacity to change.</p><p>“They created a space for this discussion, and that’s never happened before,” he told me, referring to the panel. The room was packed, and some of Ms. Harris’s advisers were there, he said. “There’s a sense that she wants to turn a corner. Does it happen tomorrow? I don’t think so. But it will happen.”</p><p>I wondered how many times he’d gotten his hopes up in the past, and how many times he’d been disappointed. “Isn’t it the purest expression of belief in the system?” Rebecca Abou Chedid, who worked for Mr. Zogby at the Arab American Institute years ago, told me. “The alternative is to give up. So you keep trying.”</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
