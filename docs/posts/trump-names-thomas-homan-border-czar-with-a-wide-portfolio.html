    <h1>Trump Names Thomas Homan ‘Border Czar’ With a Wide Portfolio</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One major question is whether the new administration will implement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/arrestees-trump-workplace-immigration-raid-mississippi.html" title="">large-scale worksite raids</a> that could lead to the arrest of unauthorized workers. Mr. Homan said <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-mass-deportation-plan-cost-consequences-60-minutes-transcript/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on CBS’s “60 Minutes” last month</a> that such raids, which have not been conducted under President Biden, would resume under the new administration. Mr. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.</p><p>Mr. Homan was named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/thomas-homan-immigration-and-customs-enforcement.html" title="">acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> in 2017, and he has decades of experience in immigration enforcement. He was a police officer, a United States Border Patrol agent and a special agent with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s announcement on Sunday was the latest clue into who will — and won’t — be his cabinet members and closest advisers. On Thursday, Mr. Trump named Susie Wiles, who has run his political operation, as his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/susie-wiles-trump-white-house-chief-of-staff.html" title="">White House</a> chief of staff. On Saturday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/us/politics/trump-haley-pompeo.html" title="">he said that he would not invite</a> Nikki Haley, his former ambassador to the United Nations, or Mike Pompeo, his former secretary of state, to join the new administration.</p></div></div>
