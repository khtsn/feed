The vote showed that support for restricting Israel’s military operations has grown beyond just the most progressive lawmakers, with notably more senators joining them than in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/us/politics/senate-israel-aid.html" title="">previous efforts</a>.</p><p>The measures were offered by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who has been a vocal critic of Israel’s tactics in the war. He has also been a frequent critic of the Biden administration for continuing to support Israel militarily despite ample evidence of human rights violations in Gaza. In the days since the election, he has also argued that the administration’s Israel policy is partially to blame for the Democrats’ election losses.</p><p>“You cannot condemn” human rights violations around the world, Mr. Sanders said on the Senate floor on Wednesday, “and then turn a blind eye to what the United States is now funding in Israel — people will laugh in your face.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He argued that the United States was breaking its own laws by continuing to send Israel weapons when it had used them to target civilians and while it was impeding the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The laws say that recipients of weapons made in the United States must use them in accordance with U.S. and international law and not impede the flow of humanitarian aid into war zones.</p><p>“If we do not demand that the countries we provide military assistance to obey international law, we will lose our credibility on the world stage,” Mr. Sanders said.</p><p>The measures, which failed after all Republicans and most Democrats opposed them, are most likely the last chance that senators critical of Israel’s military operations will have to try to restrict the flow of U.S. weapons before President-elect Donald J. Trump returns to the White House.</p><p>Mr. Trump has a history of supporting the right-wing government of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. During Mr. Trump’s first term, his administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html" title="">moved the U.S. embassy</a> to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, recognized the disputed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/politics/benjamin-netanyahu-donald-trump-meeting.html" title="">Golan Heights as Israeli territory</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/politics/trump-palestinians-aid-cut.html" title="">slashed the U.S. aid budget</a> for Palestinians and directed that some products made in the West Bank be labeled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/middleeast/pompeo-bds-golan-heights-west-bank.html" title="">made in Israel</a>.”</p><p>Democrats are in near universal agreement that Mr. Netanyahu must exercise more restraint in its war to eradicate Hamas, and be more proactive about protecting Palestinian civilians.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But tensions within the party have escalated over the Biden administration’s decision to keep supplying Israel with U.S.-made weapons, even as the country stymies efforts to send humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. More than 43,000 residents of Gaza have been killed in the 13-month conflict, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-death-toll.html" title="">most of the reported deaths</a> have been women and children.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, with Senators Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland; Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont; and Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon.

Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, voted present on all three.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Sanders, who has filed a number of other resolutions to block arms shipments to Israel, chose to raise those three in order to keep the debate focused solely on whether the United States should continue to supply Israel with offensive weapons.</p><p>“Many of the arms sales in question today will not reach Israel until years from now,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said on the floor as he urged members to vote against the resolution. “We have no idea what kind of threats Israel will face by then.”</p><p>The Biden administration has pressed Israel to change its tactics in Gaza, urging Mr. Netanyahu’s government to allow more aid trucks to enter the strip and delaying certain shipments of weapons to Israel to emphasize its frustration with Mr. Netanyahu. But the White House and congressional Democrats aligned with it have balked at proposals to cut off the flow of weapons or mandate additional statutory conditions for doing so.</p><p>Proponents of the resolutions argued that the White House’s approach to Israel had proved ineffective, necessitating action from Congress.</p><p>“What we see is a continuing pattern: President Biden makes certain demands that are routinely ignored without consequence — in fact they’re rewarded,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said on the floor. “This is an ineffective use of American leverage to accomplish our policy goals and ensure that American law is abided by.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Republicans were united in opposition to the measures. Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who will take over as majority leader next year, signaled on Tuesday that the G.O.P. would increase U.S. military support for Israel.</p><p>“To our allies in Israel, and to the Jewish people around the world, my message to you is this: Reinforcements are on the way,” Mr. Thune said on Tuesday, adding that when the G.O.P. takes over the Senate, “we will make clear that the United States Congress stands squarely in Israel’s corner.”</p><p>While U.S. law gives Congress power to block the sale or transfer of weapons to foreign countries, it has historically been extremely difficult for lawmakers to wield that power successfully. In 2019, both chambers of Congress voted to block the first Trump administration from sending about $8 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, arguing that the materiel in question had been used against civilians in Yemen. Mr. Trump vetoed the legislation, and the sales went through.</p><p>Mr. Sanders’s resolutions faced even longer odds. Congress has never blocked a weapons transfer to Israel, which enjoys favored status for U.S. arms exports. Congress also has a more limited time frame for disapproving.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karoun Demirjian covers Congress with a focus on defense, foreign policy, intelligence, immigration, and trade and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian">More about Karoun Demirjian</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Hostages in Gaza:</strong> As he resists pressure to reach a cease-fire that would release the captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is now offering a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-5-million-dollars-hostage.html">$5 million reward for their freedom</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lebanon’s Unlikely National Hero:</strong> Middle East Airlines has managed to fly through regional and civil wars since the 1960s. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/middleeast/middle-east-airlines-lebanon.html">And it is still in the skies today</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aid Trucks Looted in Gaza:</strong> A large convoy of trucks carrying aid was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html">“violently looted” in the enclave</a>, the main United Nations agency that helps Palestinians said, calling it one of the worst such incidents of the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oct. 7 Leak Investigation:</strong> An Israeli judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/middleeast/israel-document-leaks.html">revealed more details</a> in a case involving an official in Netanyahu’s office and a military officer suspected of leaking and mishandling classified intelligence documents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traces of Normalcy in Gaza:</strong> Most people in Gaza are struggling just to survive Israel’s assault on Hamas, and experts say famine is imminent.
