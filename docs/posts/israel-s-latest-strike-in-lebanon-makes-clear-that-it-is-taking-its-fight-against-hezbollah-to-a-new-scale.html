The <a href="#iran-lebanon-gaza-ceasefire" title="">contrasting diplomacy and defiance</a> spotlighted Iran’s efforts to assert its regional power while limiting damage to its land and people.</p><div><p>Israeli warplanes carried out an overnight strike in an area just south of Beirut that targeted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/world/middleeast/hashem-safieddine-hezbollah-leader.html?smid=url-share" title="">Hashem Safieddine</a>, a cousin and the presumed successor of Hassan Nasrallah, the assassinated Hezbollah leader, according to three Israeli officials. It remained unclear on Friday whether Mr. Safieddine had been killed in the attack, which set off huge explosions and left part of the densely populated area known as the Dahiya a ruined landscape of jagged concrete, twisted metal and smoldering debris. </p><p>The Israeli strikes, and Iran’s own attacks, have heightened fears of a full-blown war between the two countries.</p><p>Here is what else to know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Biden takes questions:</strong> President Biden made a surprise appearance at the White House briefing room on Friday, where he was asked about his suggestion on Thursday that U.S. officials were considering whether to support Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities. “The Israelis have not concluded how they, what they’re going to do in terms of a strike,” he said, adding that if he were in the Israelis’ shoes, “I would be thinking about other alternatives.” He added that he still planned to speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p></li><li><p><strong>In Tehran: </strong>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a href="#ayatollah-khamenei-iran" title="">led the Friday prayers in Tehran</a>, which he has done only in extraordinary circumstances.

Central Command said <a href="https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1842269883226075153" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that it struck 15 targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.</p><div><p>“These actions were taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels,” the post said.</p><p>The Houthi-affiliated al-Masirah TV reported four strikes on Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, seven on the port city of Hodeidah and at least one strike on Dhamar, south of the capital.</p><p>The attack on Sanaa came as the Houthis and their supporters were holding their weekly “million-man march” protest, which this week was focused on Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike near Beirut, Lebanon, last Friday.</p><p>The Houthi-run Yemen News Agency, SABA, reported that Hashem Sharaf al-Din, a Houthi official, said that he considered the strikes “a desperate attempt” to intimidate the Yemeni people and he vowed not to be deterred by them.</p><p>But the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels have increasingly drawn the ire of international actors and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/13/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war/an-oil-tanker-still-burning-in-the-red-sea-raises-alarms-at-a-un-security-council-meeting?smid=url-share" title="">condemnation by diplomats</a>.

The ship was towed to safety in mid-September.</p><p>The attacks on commercial shipping have been met with counter strikes by the United States military and British troops before.

It’s doing so not just in the south, where its ground invasion is seeking to halt Hezbollah’s rocket fire into northern Israel, but also with its systematic targeting of Hezbollah’s remaining leadership, whose movements Israeli intelligence apparently still track.</p><p>Many people in Lebanon and the broader Middle East had long feared that such a war was coming, even before the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. Hezbollah began firing on northern Israel soon after in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza.

Mr. Khamenei made his comments at Friday prayers in Tehran.</p><p>The twin images of diplomacy and defiance underscored Iran’s difficult position as it endeavors to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/world/middleeast/what-game-theory-tells-us-about-the-threat-of-an-israel-iran-war.html" title="">assert itself but also limit damage</a> to its land and people.</p><p>Mr. Araghchi described his discussion with Najib Mikati, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, as involving “very good negotiations and consultations,” according to Iranian Press TV, a government channel.</p><p>In a news conference he elaborated, saying that: “Iran supports the efforts for a cease-fire, provided that first, the rights of the Lebanese people are respected and it is accepted by the resistance, and second, it comes simultaneously with a cease-fire in Gaza,” according to the official state Islamic Republic News Agency.</p><p>The “resistance” is shorthand for the armed groups allied with Iran in countries across the Middle East, most importantly, in this context, Hezbollah.</p><p>While Mr. Araghchi raised the idea of a cease-fire, it is hard to imagine such a deal in the near-term because with Israel’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/27/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas" title="">fatal attack</a> on Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah a week ago, hostilities have only spiraled. Mr. Araghchi’s trip to Lebanon came as fears mounted that Israel could counterattack Iran soon in retribution for Iran’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">attack</a> Tuesday on Israel, which was in retribution for the killing of Mr. Nasrallah and leaders of other militant groups allied with Iran.</p><p>Israel’s targets in Lebanon — it has bombed the country almost daily since Mr. Nasrallah’s assassination — have been Hezbollah leaders and their weapon stockpiles. However, the bombing has also killed civilians and put to flight more than a million Lebanese, who are fearful they will be caught in the crossfire, according to the Lebanese government.</p><p>Hezbollah is a Shiite Muslim militant group formed in the 1980s during the chaos of Lebanon’s civil war with the guidance of Iran. The intent was that it would fight the Israeli occupation in Lebanon and support the struggle of Palestinians in Israel. Since then, Hezbollah has become a powerful political force in Lebanon as well as a military one.</p><p>In a tweet on the platform X, Mr. <a href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1842153151849189815" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Araghchi wrote</a>: “I am in Beirut—alongside members of our Parliament and Red Crescent Society—to make clear that Iran will ALWAYS stand with people of Lebanon.” He called on other regional governments “to also display steadfastness in their support for Lebanon, especially amid onslaught by the Israeli regime.”</p><p>According to Iran’s state run Press TV, the foreign minister brought food and medicine with him for distribution to displaced Lebanese people.</p><p>At Thursday’s meetings in Doha, both Mr. Araghchi and Mr. Pezeshkian appeared eager to show their alliance with Gulf countries, even as some of Iran-linked groups in Iraq have threatened to attack the oil and gas assets of the United Arab Emirates because of their relationship with Israel.</p><p>Publicly, however, they focused on their ties to their Arab neighbors. “Our neighbors are our priority,” said Mr. Araghchi in his <a href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1841926827092103670" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet from Doha</a>, adding “Dialogue is a must.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWRmMjNmOGUtMzE1Zi01YjJjLTk1YzAtMGU3MmUyODExNjdj"><div id="adf23f8e-315f-5b2c-95c0-0e72e281167c" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#adf23f8e-315f-5b2c-95c0-0e72e281167c"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs"><img alt="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-04T18:54:25.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 4, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>President Biden told reporters in the briefing room that he still planned on speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &#34;I&#39;m assuming when they make their judgement about how they&#39;re going to respond, we will then have a discussion,&#34;

Just months ago, an Israeli strike in the heart of the city was an abrupt turn of events that escalated the conflict. Now, it is fast becoming the norm, punctuating bedtimes, family dinners and phone calls with friends.</p><p>Many residents say they loathe the stereotype that the Lebanese are resilient.</p><p>“I wish sometimes that we could just sit and cry our eyes out and not know what to do, but we always know what to do — what to pack, what we need,” said Ms. Choucair. “It has nothing to do with resilience or any positive trait. It’s a natural survival mode that we have been trained to automate.”</p><p>She added: “This is how it is living in Beirut. It will never change. I am 41. It has been like this for as long as I remember.”</p><p>Many apartments now lie vacant in Beirut, a once-bustling Mediterranean city and home to 2.5 million people. Those that had the means have fled up the coast or into the surrounding hills, but this has done little to ease their growing fears. The distant thump of Israeli airstrikes seems to draw closer with each passing day. Nights, too, are spent fretting over whether a sound was just a neighbor’s slamming door — or something more.</p><p>“All my dreams are about bombs,” said Heba Jundi, 36, who was staying at a friend’s house in the mountains above Beirut with her cat, Benji.</p><p>“Some nights I go to bed, I close my eyes, but I don’t allow myself to sleep,” said Ms. Jundi. “I’m telling myself that I’m waiting for the bomb to happen, and that I’m going to hear it any second now. We are all waiting for this to stop, but at the same time we know it is not going to stop, and we just have no clue or understanding of where this is going to go.”</p><p>Like so many others, she had begun taking anti-anxiety medication to deal with the stress, but said it was having little effect.</p><p>“I don’t know how much more the city can take,” Ms. Jundi said, “and I don’t think anyone wants to find out.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTRjMzc1ZjEtY2VlMC01ODQ2LWJkN2MtYTc1Y2EwMjYxMTg3"><div id="a4c375f1-cee0-5846-bd7c-a75ca0261187" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#a4c375f1-cee0-5846-bd7c-a75ca0261187"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ephrat-livni"><img alt="Ephrat Livni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/business/author-ephrat-livni/author-ephrat-livni-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-04T18:10:08.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 4, 2024, 2:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The Israeli military said on Friday evening that its Air Force had in the past day struck several Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, command centers, and other infrastructure in the area of Beirut.

Residents said a family of four was among the dead, and on Friday, desperate people were still searching for loved ones in the rubble. </p><p>The Israeli military said that the strike killed the head of Hamas in the city, Tulkarm, whom it accused of leading attacks on settlers in the West Bank and supplying weapons to other fighters. Both Hamas and another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, confirmed that their local leaders had been killed in the strike. But most of the dead were civilians, according to residents, among them Abu Zahra’s family, including 7-year-old Sham and 5-year-old Karam, who lived above the cafe.</p><div><p>“Our family and the entire camp is already devastated,” said Anas Kharyoush, a cousin of the children’s mother, 28-year-old Saja Abu Zahra, referring to the neighborhood’s origin as a refugee camp for Palestinians displaced from their homes by the wars surrounding Israel’s establishment. “They are not the first martyrs in our family, and this is not the first airstrike in our neighborhood, but it’s the most devastating.”</p><p>The explosion was so fierce that the remains of those killed had to be gathered in blankets and sheets and taken to a hospital for bereft family members to identify, according to residents and videos of the aftermath. And the search for the missing continued.<span>  </span></p><p>“Mothers are desperate to know about their children, and families are still looking for their loved ones,” said Diala Hadaydah, a paramedic who lives in the neighborhood, who rushed to the scene moments after the strike.</p><p>The Israeli military did not respond to questions about the number of civilians killed in Thursday’s strike.</p><p>The strike in the densely packed area came amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/world/middleeast/jenin-israel-withdraw-destruction.html" title="">increasingly deadly</a> Israeli raids on Palestinian towns and cities across the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in what the military labels counterterrorism operations. </p><p>Tulkarm, which has a history of armed resistance against the nearly six-decade Israeli occupation of the West Bank, has been the frequent target of such raids. For more than nine days, starting in late August, Israeli bulldozers ripped through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/west-bank-raids.html" title="">roads, infrastructure and businesses</a> there, as well as in nearby Jenin. </p><p>Palestinians say they are terrified in their own homes, fearful of onslaughts from the ground — from tanks, armored vehicles or more bulldozers — and from the sky. The Israeli military has said the raids are an effort to crack down on Palestinian armed groups and combat rising attacks against Israelis and settlements.</p><p>Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law but have continued to expand, threatening Palestinian livelihoods in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/world/middleeast/israel-settlers-attack-jit-west-bank.html" title="">cities, towns and farming villages</a>. </p><p>Violence in the West Bank has been increasing since the war began in Gaza last Oct. 7, but the toll has been far higher among Palestinians. As one gauge, <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/violence-destruction-and-displacement-west-bank" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a United Nations report</a> in mid-September, counting conflict fatalities from January 2023 onward, put Israeli fatalities at 41 and Palestinian fatalities at 722. </p><p>In the strike on Tulkarm on Thursday, witnesses said that an Israeli warplane fired at least one missile at the cafe while it was occupied by civilians. The use of a warplane there was unusual. Though Israel has increasingly been conducting once-rare airstrikes in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, they have usually been carried out by armed drones. </p><p>Ms. Hadaydah, the paramedic, said the sound of the explosion was unlike anything she had ever heard before. She rushed to the scene and saw the scattered remains of body parts, burned beyond recognition. Ms. Hadaydah said only five bodies were intact.</p><p>“I saw teeth, I saw skin, I saw bodies hanging from electricity cables,” Ms. Hadaydah said. “It looked just like Gaza.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYzYxMzdlODAtMGJmZi01MjdlLWJkY2UtODk0ZDExN2I1YjM3"><div id="c6137e80-0bff-527e-bdce-894d117b5b37" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#c6137e80-0bff-527e-bdce-894d117b5b37"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward"><img alt="Euan Ward" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/08/reader-center/author-euan-ward/author-euan-ward-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-04T15:10:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 4, 2024, 11:10 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>At least four hospitals across southern Lebanon are now out of service as a result of Israel&#39;s bombardment, according to Lebanon’s state-run news agency.

He referred to Israel as “a rabid dog,” “blood thirsty,” and “wolf like,” and said that “any strike on the Zionist regime is a service to humanity.”</p><p>He pledged support for the network of regional militias Iran backs that is known as the “axis of resistance,” which includes Hamas and Hezbollah, and which has taken significant hits from Israeli strikes in recent weeks. And he said that Iran would continue to support the Palestinians and Lebanese and called for pan-Muslim unity to stand against Israel and the United States, which he said was an accomplice in what he called Israel’s military crimes.</p><p>“The Islamic Republic will fulfill all its duty in this regard with force, determination and strength,” Mr. Khamenei said. “We will not rush nor delay.”</p><p>If necessary in the future, he added, Iran would respond again, as it had done days earlier by launching ballistic missiles at Israel.</p><p>Mr. Khamenei’s appearance in person at the prayers, despite security concerns, signaled the significance of the moment, as anxiety has mounted that Israel and Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/iran-missile-attack-israel-war.html" title="">appear prepared to risk all-out conflict</a>.</p><p>Sina Azodi, an adjunct professor at George Washington University and an expert on Iran’s national security, said that Mr. Khamenei’s message “was one of defiance, solidarity with resistance groups and the Arab public and to shore up domestic support for a potential conflict with Israel.” He added, “He is sending a signaling to abroad that Iran is not going to take any irrational actions or escalate but will respond to potential attacks.”</p><p>State television showed tens of thousands of supporters packing the sprawling arena — men sitting separately from women — and spilling into the streets of central Tehran. They waved Hezbollah, Lebanese and Palestinian flags and held up posters of Mr. Nasrallah. Some men wore yellow Hezbollah headbands.</p><p>One woman, who was shrouded in a white cloth symbolizing martyrdom and attended the event with her family and toddler in tow, told state television that she came to deliver a message, “Since the enemy has threatened us, we are here to say we are not afraid of anything.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Khamenei addressed thousands on Friday, in a photograph released by his office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Office Of The Iranian Supreme Leader/Wana News Agency, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Despite official rhetoric, in interviews, virtual town halls and social media posts, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#iran-anxiety-war-israel" title="">many Iranians said they were anxious about a war</a> with Israel and that they do not want one.</p><p>Mr. Khamenei switched from Persian to Arabic to address Palestinians and people in Lebanon, which has been battered by Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah. He defended Tuesday’s Iranian missile attack against Israel as “completely legal and legitimate.”</p><p>“What our armed forces did was the least punishment they could do” against Israel, he said, adding, “what is logical and rational will be done at the right time and will be done again in the future if necessary.”</p><p>Senior Iranian officials, including the new president Masoud Pezeshkian, the head of parliament and senior military commanders sat in the front row during the ceremony. Mr. Pezeshkian told reporters ahead of the event that the ceremony aimed to “project a show of unity, cohesion and power.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Iran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/world/middleeast/iran-ballistic-missiles-israel-assassinations.html" title="">fired nearly 200 missiles</a> at Israel in retaliation for Mr. Nasrallah’s death and the recent killings of Hamas’s political leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, and an Iranian commander, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said. Israel has said it would retaliate with strikes against Iran, sparking fears of a regional war.</p><p>In a series of attacks, Israel has aimed to reduce the military capabilities and dismantle the leadership of Hezbollah, a militia group backed by Iran and based in Lebanon. On Thursday night around midnight, Israel launched an intense barrage of airstrikes in a neighborhood south of Beirut in an effort to target <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/world/middleeast/hashem-safieddine-hezbollah-leader.html" title="">Hashem Safieddine</a>, Mr. Nasrallah’s presumed successor, according to three Israeli officials.It is rare for Mr.Khamenei to lead Friday prayers and deliver the sermon, typically doing so only under extraordinary circumstances related to Iran’s national security. The last time was in 2020, after the United States killed Iran’s top general, Maj. Gen. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/obituaries/qassem-soleimani-dead.html" title="">Qassim Suleimani</a>, in Iraq. Iran retaliated by firing ballistic missiles at an American base in Iraq. </p><p>Plans for an official funeral for Mr. Nasrallah have not been announced. It is not clear whether it is feasible for Hezbollah and what remains of its leadership to gather publicly, given Israel’s attacks.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYWRhZTk1MDUtNjk1Yy01NWY0LThhY2MtNTE0NzMwOTZjYTk0"><div id="adae9505-695c-55f4-8acc-51473096ca94" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#adae9505-695c-55f4-8acc-51473096ca94"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jason-karaian"><img alt="Jason Karaian" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/reader-center/author-jason-karaian/author-jason-karaian-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/reader-center/author-jason-karaian/author-jason-karaian-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/reader-center/author-jason-karaian/author-jason-karaian-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-04T11:38:11.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 4, 2024, 7:38 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Oil prices are extending their gains today, propelled by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/politics/biden-oil-markets-middle-east.html" title="">President Biden’s offhand remarks</a> yesterday about Israel’s potential retaliation against Iran.
