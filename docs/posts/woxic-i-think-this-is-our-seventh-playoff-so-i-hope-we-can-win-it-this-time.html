The two men spoke for about half an hour just before a summit of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia, a White House official said.</p><p>Mr. Trump told Mr. al-Shara that “he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,” according to a summary of the meeting from the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. The president also urged Mr. al-Shara to take steps to normalize Syria’s relations with Israel, which have long been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/europe/syria-france-al-shara-macron.html" title="">hostile</a>, and to tell “all foreign terrorists to leave” the country, the summary said.</p><p>Mr. Trump met Mr. al-Shara at the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, who took part in the meeting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, which backed the insurgency that brought Mr. al-Shara to power, joined by phone. Prince Mohammed and Mr. Erdogan had both urged Mr. Trump to lift the sanctions on Syria, and they praised the move in the meeting on Wednesday, with the crown prince describing it as “courageous,” according to the White House summary.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14trump-news-header4/14trump-news-header4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14trump-news-header4/14trump-news-header4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14trump-news-header4/14trump-news-header4-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Donald Trump seated at a summit table, flanked by cabinet officials." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14trump-news-header4/14trump-news-header4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14trump-news-header4/14trump-news-header4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14trump-news-header4/14trump-news-header4-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14trump-news-header4/14trump-news-header4-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ac051269-283c-5f24-8c1a-af7c6d2031b2" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump and members of his cabinet at a summit with Gulf leaders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The encounter was also a stunning turnaround for Mr. al-Shara, an ex-militant who led the rebel alliance that ousted the dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, and who once led a branch of Al Qaeda before he broke ties with the jihadist group and sought to moderate his image. The United States designated Mr. al-Shara’s militant group as a terrorist organization, and it dropped its offer of a reward of up to $10 million for information on him just five months ago. </p><p>A statement from the Syrian Foreign Ministry described the meeting as “historic” and said that Mr. Trump had “affirmed that the administration in Washington is committed to playing a positive and constructive role during this sensitive period.”</p><p>Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the Saudi foreign minister, said at a news conference later on Wednesday that Syria’s “many opportunities, capabilities, and resources” were “one of the most important points of discussion” at the meeting. “It has resources, and more importantly, it has a capable people: an educated, knowledgeable population that is eager to move Syria into a new phase,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The meeting took place on the second day of Mr. Trump’s four-day Middle East tour, the first major overseas trip of his second term.
