Marathon</a> on Sunday morning, the final two hobbled across the finish line long after the sun had set.</p><p>On crutches and with a bandage wrapped around her thigh, Danielle Grimley, 41, of Colorado, crossed just after 9:30 p.m. to complete her first marathon in 10 hours 32 minutes and 7 seconds.</p><p>Mario Bollini, 74, of Italy, followed just a few minutes later, finishing in 10:01:47. He said through an interpreter that this was his 37th marathon in New York.</p><p>Mr. Bollini said he had run 78 marathons, and in New York he has <a href="https://results.nyrr.org/runner/41357030/races" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">always finished within 5 hours</a>. (In 1989, he finished in exactly 3 hours.) But he injured his knee in January while training. Two people, he said, had told him he wouldn’t be able to run the race this year. But he was determined to prove them wrong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In the final miles, Mr. Bollini said, he worried that the medals and food would be gone when he finally finished.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bollini was met by Ted Metellus, the race director, at the finish line.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Grimley has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects connective tissues around joints, and she sometimes has knee issues. On Sunday morning, she said, her knees felt fine and she hoped to finish the race in 5 hours.</p><p>But in Mile 6, her hip started bothering her. When she reached Mile 17, she said, her hip “went out,” and she ended up in a medical tent at East 80th Street and First Avenue.</p><p>She said she asked the medic if he had crutches for her, “and he said, ‘Hell, yeah.’”</p><p>As she approached the finish line in Central Park, word had already reached the medics stationed there that someone was finishing on crutches. They met her with a wheelchair.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Unofficial celebrations of back-of-the-pack runners at the New York marathon started in 2016 with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/projectfinishnyc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a group of people</a> who showed up with cowbells, signs, glow sticks and their cheering voices for racers who might have otherwise finished in the quiet dark.</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher--03-cvml/04nycm-last-finisher--03-cvml-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher--03-cvml/04nycm-last-finisher--03-cvml-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher--05-cvml/04nycm-last-finisher--05-cvml-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher--05-cvml/04nycm-last-finisher--05-cvml-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher-fans--jmck/04nycm-last-finisher-fans--jmck-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher-fans--jmck/04nycm-last-finisher-fans--jmck-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-3-" data-credit="Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher--04-cvml/04nycm-last-finisher--04-cvml-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/04/multimedia/04nycm-last-finisher--04-cvml/04nycm-last-finisher--04-cvml-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The race organizers have since built the celebrations into the schedule, also adding a team of 70 volunteers working between Mile 15 and the finish line to offer help and encouragement to the marathon’s final runners.</p><p>The New York race, which is generally considered the most welcoming of the major marathons to everyday runners, was the first to begin official celebrations. Many marathons have a cutoff time of around 6 to 8 hours and will sweep the course for stragglers.

Some earlier finishers had stayed, still wearing the orange ponchos distributed at the end of the race. Others had returned, dressed more warmly in coats, their medals around their necks.</p><p>As midnight approached, the last finishers were spread apart, sometimes arriving in groups, sometimes appearing solo, out of the dark. The small crowd rang cowbells and waved lighted batons that glowed red, green and blue, meeting each runner with a bright welcome in the chilly night.</p><p>As Ms. Grimley slowly hopped from Mile 17 through to the finish, she said, she thought about how it would feel if she went back to Colorado without the finisher medal.
