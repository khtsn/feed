He said he was still dealing with internal injuries two weeks after the Chinese authorities boarded his fishing boat and bashed him with iron pipes in a patch of the South China Sea claimed by both China and Vietnam.</p><p>“I got hit first in the head from behind — I was running to the front of the boat,” he said, sitting beside his father, who taught him to fish near their home on Vietnam’s south-central coast. “With the second blow, I lost consciousness.”</p><p>When he awoke, his catch, worth nearly $8,000, was gone. His ribs were broken. And three other crew members were injured.</p><p>China’s aggressive policing of disputed territory has produced the latest clash in a long, complex relationship. China ruled Vietnam for a millennium, leaving an indelible cultural mark, but Vietnam’s national identity and fierce independence spring from its resistance to Chinese empire-building, as its school students learn from a young age.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>And the South China Sea is where Vietnam’s defiance is being tested — on its own and alongside other countries, including the Philippines and Indonesia, which are also struggling to hold on to parts of the sea that China seeks to control.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/world/00vietnam-china-15/00vietnam-china-15-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/world/00vietnam-china-15/00vietnam-china-15-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/world/00vietnam-china-15/00vietnam-china-15-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="As a shirtless man faces to the right, a partly obscured man in a blue shirt places his left hand on the man’s shoulder." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/world/00vietnam-china-15/00vietnam-china-15-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/world/00vietnam-china-15/00vietnam-china-15-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/world/00vietnam-china-15/00vietnam-china-15-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/world/00vietnam-china-15/00vietnam-china-15-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/82e493bd-9398-50bc-b3c9-67a5ac387486" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nguyen Thanh Bien getting a massage with medicated oil from his father this month to help with injuries from being beaten by the Chinese authorities while fishing in the South China Sea.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fishermen this month at the port of Sa Ky, south of Danang in central Vietnam.

But the violence, described in interviews, insurance claims and letters to the Vietnamese government, fit a pattern: China has already used water cannons, boat-ramming, ship-sinking and lasers in its effort to assert dominance over the South China Sea.<span>  </span>Last week, it held a bombing exercise in the Gulf of Tonkin, issuing an <a href="https://www.msa.gov.cn/page/article.do?articleId=719921AF-53C6-414C-8052-C0697D4BCE6F&amp;channelId=86DE2FFF-FF2C-47F9-8359-FD1F20D6508F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“entering prohibited” warning</a> for waters 75 miles from Vietnam’s coast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The beatings and military operations, which closely followed more extensive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/asia/china-taiwan-live-fire-drills.html" title="">drills around Taiwan</a>, occurred less than a month after Vietnam’s new leader, To Lam, met with President Biden in New York. He had gone first to Beijing, and some analysts suggested that China was expanding its intimidation tactics to scare Hanoi — and others — away from Washington and alliances with neighbors.</p><p>“It shows that China may be harder on the new Vietnamese leadership going forward in the South China Sea,” said Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. “It also shows that the new Vietnamese leadership does not have much space to further accommodate China.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-8"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/vietnam-fishermen-70171-cover/vietnam-fishermen-70171-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/vietnam-fishermen-70171-cover/vietnam-fishermen-70171-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/25/128557_1_vietnam-fishermen-70171_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In a good month, a fishing crew in Vietnam can make more than three times what the average worker makes in a year.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Beijing’s tight squeeze may change Hanoi’s calculus. Ever since China and Vietnam <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/world/asia/vietnam.html" title="">traded angry accusations</a> over the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing vessel near a Chinese oil rig in 2014, Hanoi has preferred to say very little while bolstering its defenses with a not-quite-military strategy similar to China’s.</p><p>When the oil rig issue faded — China pulled out its equipment ahead of schedule — Vietnam gave preferential loans to fishermen. Seeing China’s maritime militia, Vietnam formed a smaller version of its own, giving some fishermen steel boats stronger than Mr. Bien’s wooden one and offering military training. The government also pays fishermen for four fuel loads a year to keep them on the water. It is quietly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2024/vietnam-south-china-sea-islands-growth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dredging and expanding</a> small islands it occupies near China’s built-up outposts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When incidents occur, and they frequently do — some fishermen keep folders of citations from the Chinese authorities going back to 2009 — Vietnamese officials have preferred to work behind the scenes, in part because Chinese aggression is such a combustible domestic topic. For Vietnamese leaders, intense pressure can come from both Beijing and from the public’s anti-China rage.</p><p>So while the Philippines, facing its own conflicts with China, has begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/south-china-sea-philippines.html" title="">document and publicize</a> almost every perceived act of Chinese bullying in disputed waters, Vietnam has been more selective. In June, a fishing boat and its crew from Mr. Bien’s village, Chau Thuan Bien, about 80 miles south of Danang, disappeared after reporting by radio an encounter with the Chinese authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fish and other seafood on display at a market near the port of Sa Ky, Vietnam.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The house of the captain of a boat that disappeared in June after reporting by radio an encounter with the Chinese authorities.

Relatives say they have still not heard anything from the men since one called to say they were being held on China’s Hainan Island. The Foreign Ministry in Hanoi did not respond to questions about the case, which has not previously been reported.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The assault on Mr. Bien, however, appears to have crossed a line, prompting a response on Oct. 2 that was far stronger than usual.</p><p>“Vietnam is extremely concerned, indignant and resolutely opposes the brutal behavior of Chinese law enforcement forces against Vietnamese fishermen and fishing vessels operating in the Paracel archipelago of Vietnam,” said the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Pham Thu Hang.</p><p>The attack has also shaken Mr. Bien’s coastal hamlet of 300 families, many of whom have been fishing for generations. Vietnam’s war with the United States exacted a heavy toll across the area, but in communities where nets sparkle at dusk and round basket boats brighten the beaches, China and the sea are timeless, elemental threats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-17"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/vietnam-fishermen-73810-cover/vietnam-fishermen-73810-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/vietnam-fishermen-73810-cover/vietnam-fishermen-73810-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/25/128558_1_vietnam-fishermen-73810_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">This area of Vietnam is dotted with fishing communities, where the sea is a timeless, elemental threat.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>At a sun-yellow shrine with smoke dancing above incense, people pray for safety from the dangers that have wounded and killed loved ones for generations, from storms and wars to the risky local method of diving deep to spearfish.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At the port, where Mr. Bien’s boat engine was being repaired, a few dozen wooden haulers were crammed together, as if pushed in by a typhoon. Several captains said not a single vessel had left for the daylong journey to the usual fishing area since the news of the beating.</p><p>About a dozen boats that had already been out remained at sea, their crews hesitant to cut short what is usually a monthlong trip. At least one captain reported by text that his ship was being chased from fish-rich reefs by Chinese law enforcement.</p><p>“Many people are afraid,” said Nguyen Tan Van, one of the captains sitting in the shade at the port. “It will take time for the fear to die down before we go back out.”</p><p>The people of Vietnam have been drawing sustenance and wealth from what they call the East Sea for centuries. For a fishing crew, one good month there can yield a profit of $12,000, more than three times what the average worker makes in a year. And with Beijing also claiming an ancient right to the area, fishing has taken on near-military significance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Repairing broken glass this month on Mr. Bien’s fishing boat.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Documents relating to when Mr. Bien’s boat was held by the Chinese in 2009.

Mr. Bien, 41, said his insurance company categorized what had happened on Sept. 30 as “an act of war” and was still rejecting his claim.</p><p>“It’s very stressful,” said his wife, Nguyen Thi Dung, who did not know if he was alive until a full day after she heard about his emergency call.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>But for their family and others, worry at sea is the way it was, is and must be.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A local shrine where people pray for good luck before going offshore fishing.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nguyen Thanh Nam, Mr. Bien’s uncle, helping run a radio system that lets fishermen stay in contact with land and track Chinese activities.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“Why should we stop?

He smoked a slim cigarette a few steps from where his father taught him to dive.
