He said he was still dealing with internal injuries two weeks after the Chinese authorities boarded his fishing boat and bashed him with iron pipes in a patch of the South China Sea claimed by both China and Vietnam.</p><p>“I got hit first in the head from behind — I was running to the front of the boat,” he said, sitting beside his father, who taught him to fish near their home on Vietnam’s south-central coast. “With the second blow, I lost consciousness.”</p><p>When he awoke, his catch, worth nearly $8,000, was gone. His ribs were broken. And three other crew members were injured.</p><p>China’s aggressive policing of disputed territory has produced the latest clash in a long, complex relationship.

Seeing China’s maritime militia, Vietnam formed a smaller version of its own, giving some fishermen steel boats stronger than Mr. Bien’s wooden one and offering military training. The government also pays fishermen for four fuel loads a year to keep them on the water. It is quietly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2024/vietnam-south-china-sea-islands-growth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dredging and expanding</a> small islands it occupies near China’s built-up outposts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When incidents occur, and they frequently do — some fishermen keep folders of citations from the Chinese authorities going back to 2009 — Vietnamese officials have preferred to work behind the scenes, in part because Chinese aggression is such a combustible domestic topic.
