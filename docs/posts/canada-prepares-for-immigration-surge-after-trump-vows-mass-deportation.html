And that border — separating the United States and Canada — seems set to become a flashpoint between the close allies as President-elect Donald J. Trump prepares to take power.</p><p>The Canadian authorities fear that Mr. Trump’s promised mass deportations will push migrants north, while allies of the incoming president headed for key roles in his administration have raised alarms over a recent spike in undocumented migrants crossing from Canada to the United States.</p><p>Canadian officials are drawing up plans to add patrols, buy new vehicles and set up emergency reception facilities at the border between New York State and the province of Quebec to prepare for what they expect to be a surge in migrants because of Mr. Trump’s hard line on deportations.</p><p>The northern border is also a focus of people named to top positions in the Trump administration, including his new border czar, Tom Homan. He has described the frontier as a major security vulnerability because of what he described as insufficient checks on people entering the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Concerns over the northern border highlight a key shift in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/world/canada/canada-immigration-policy.html" title="">Canada’s view of migration</a> between the first and second Trump administrations. During the first, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada made clear that asylum seekers were welcome in Canada just as Mr. Trump was tightening asylum rules and introducing policies like family separation at the U.S. southern border.</p><p>“To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/WelcomeToCanada?src=hashtag_click" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#WelcomeToCanada</a>,” Mr. Trudeau posted on social media at the time.</p><p>Today, the mood in Canada is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/canada/canada-immigration.html" title="">very different</a>. Many Canadians believe the arrival of more legal migrants since the end of the pandemic has strained resources such as housing, and have blamed Mr. Trudeau’s government, which is now taking steps to significantly limit legal immigration.</p><p>Mr. Trump, for his part, has become more aggressive on immigration, making clear that he intends to crack down and deport millions of undocumented migrants. His allies have criticized Canada for not controlling the northern border, where arrivals of undocumented migrants into the United States hit a record high this summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Still, Canadian officials say they are fortifying the border and will deport migrants who attempt to enter Canada to escape Mr. Trump’s crackdown.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confronting migrants arriving at the Roxham Road border crossing in Quebec from New York State in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nasuna Stuart-Ulin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h3 id="link-3bc881a"><span>Bolstering the Border</span></h3><p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who guard the border, are preparing to beef up their numbers if there is a surge in three key ways — more staff, more vehicles and more detention and processing facilities — a spokesman for the agency, Sgt. Charles Poirier, said.</p><p>Officials are anticipating an increase in migrant crossings even before Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January. “We knew that, if Mr. Trump came into power, the status quo at the border would change,” Sergeant Poirier said.</p><p>The R.C.M.P. has identified enforcement agencies that could be tapped to divert extra staff to the border. The agency would also seek to add more patrol vehicles and use land along the border to set up trailers or other types of temporary detention and processing facilities.</p><p>Canada’s national security agencies “have been preparing for a number of months to be ready to respond and adapt to any situation that might arise,” said Gabriel Brunet, a spokesman for Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s minister of public safety.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Canadian authorities also intend to wield a key agreement between the two countries to send back people crossing into Canada to seek asylum. The agreement designates Canada and the United States as “safe third countries” in which to make asylum claims, so when asylum seekers travel from one country to the other, they can be sent back, with few exceptions.</p><p>“The reason that exists is that the United States is deemed to be a safe country for people to make their initial asylum claim,” Marc Miller, Canada’s immigration minister, told reporters recently. “So too with Canada — it’s a two-way street.”</p><p>“We expect that agreement to continue to be fully enforced,’’ he said.</p><p>Provincial leaders in Quebec are also anxious about the need to harden its border with New York and have already raised complaints about the growing number of legal immigrants and refugees who have settled there in recent years.</p><p>“The problem isn’t immigrants, it’s the number,’’ François Legault, the premier of Quebec, said at a recent news conference. “We already have too many. So we shouldn’t add to the problem.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New Hampshire Route 3 leads to the border with Canada.

The figure for October 2020 to September 2021 was just 365 people.</p><p>More than 12,000 of the 19,300 people detained were Indian nationals, underscoring a booming migrant smuggling route from India to the United States via Canada.</p><p>Some of this smuggling is encouraged online. Indian nationals in Canada say videos circulate on TikTok from “travel agencies’’ marketing smooth transport to the United States. These videos are also flooding social media in India, promising a route to the United States in exchange for thousands of dollars.</p><p>One TikTok ad shows a group of men with U.S. flag emojis hiding their faces advertising a “100% safe route.” The provider says it can take travelers from Brampton, a city outside Toronto with a large South Asian population, to New York, by taxi.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Despite the immigration agreement between the United States and Canada, the process to turn back people claiming asylum can take weeks at a time as migrants try to find a lawyer and gather evidence to try to make a case to avoid being sent back to Canada.</p><p>With minimal resources at the northern border, few people were being sent back to Canada earlier this year. Instead, migrants were being released from custody with notices to appear in U.S. immigration courts, which face an enormous backlog.</p><p>But starting this summer, U.S. officials deployed more federal officials to the northern border to help process people and transferred more people into detention.</p><p>They also made a key change to make the process to return migrants to Canada easier: Starting in August, migrants who had been detained had only four hours to find a lawyer and collect evidence for their case, according to an internal email sent to asylum officers working for the Department of Homeland Security and reviewed by The New York Times. Before, migrants were given at least a day to do both.</p><p>Since then, the numbers of crossings have dropped dramatically — from roughly 3,600 crossings in June to around 1,800 in September — while the number of migrants returned to Canada has increased.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>More than 400 people were returned to Canada between August and October, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>Republicans, including Mr. Trump’s allies, criticized the Biden administration repeatedly for the high number of crossings at the northern border. During Mr. Trump’s first time in office, the numbers at that border were much lower.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pittsburg, N.H., in January.
