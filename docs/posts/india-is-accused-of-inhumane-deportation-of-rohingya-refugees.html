Such labels, along with “Pakistani,” are often used to target Muslim migrants from other parts of India. The most sweeping actions were in Gujarat, in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state, and in Rajasthan.</p><p>While a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/india-muslims-detentions-demolitions.html" title="">majority of those detained turned out to be Indian citizens</a> and were later released, those who were identified as Rohingya and Bangladeshi have been deported in large numbers, including some with refugee documents that were supposed to give them protection.</p><p>The People’s Union for Civil Liberties, an India-based human rights group, criticized the move. “At the very least, the Rohingyas are entitled to due process under existing law which requires that the detainee get notice, opportunity of hearing and representation,” the group said in a statement.</p><p>Authorities in neighboring Bangladesh said India had pushed hundreds of people into its country at unpopulated border areas. Nearly a hundred were expelled into <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/798/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Sundarbans</a>, a mangrove forest between the two countries, and had to be rescued by Bangladesh’s coast guard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“If someone is proven to be a citizen of our country, we will accept them,” Khalilur Rahman, the Bangladesh government’s national security adviser, told reporters. “But this must be done through formal channels.”</p><p>The deported Rohingya appear to have mostly been in Assam, in the country’s northeast, where India has built a large detention facility, and New Delhi, the capital.</p><p>Rohingya refugees in Delhi said Indian authorities had rounded up dozens of them last week. They were taken to a police station, and never returned.</p><p>Sadeq Shalom, a Rohingya Christian refugee in New Delhi who works as an education consultant, said his older brother and several other family members were picked up and were part of a group of 40 people who were put into the sea. He said 15 of the 40 were Christians, and their pleas that they faced double persecution — as Rohingya from the state, and then as a Christian minority from the Muslim majority in their area — were in vain.</p><p>Another refugee in New Delhi, David Nazir, said his elderly parents were picked up and were also among the 40 people put to sea. He learned what had happened to them only after Mr. Shalom got a call from his brother, who borrowed a fisherman’s phone upon reaching Myanmar’s shore.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“He told me that the Indian authorities had forced them off a navy vessel in the Andaman Sea and made them swim into Myanmar territory with nothing but life jackets,” Mr. Shalom said in an interview.</p><p>Their biggest fear, Mr. Nazir said, was that the Myanmar army, which they had fled, was waiting for them. But in his phone call, Mr. Shalom’s brother said that all 40 were safe with the National Unity Government of Myanmar, which began operating in resistance after the country’s 2021 military coup.</p><p>Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer representing the Rohingya in India’s supreme court, said there are about 1,000 who have sought refuge in Delhi and <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rohingya-detainees-report-flags-indias-violation-of-human-rights/article68996943.ece#:~:text=In%20India%2C%20there%20are%20about,court%20cases%20or%20sentences%20pending%E2%80%9D." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 20,000 all over India.</a></p><p>On social media, the Indian government’s actions drew comparisons to how India’s own immigrants were recently deported from the United States by the Trump administration, sent home by plane in shackles — a move that spurred widespread outrage.</p><p>Mr. Gonsalves said that his appeal at the country’s supreme court to put a pause on the deportations <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was rejected</a>.</p><p>“We expect a little more compassion,” Mr. Gonsalves said. “Throwing refugees into the sea and then they land up in a war zone is one of the most barbaric practices a nation can indulge in.”</p><p>Saif Hasnat<!-- --> contributed reporting from Dhaka, Bangladesh, and <!-- -->Mujib Mashal<!-- --> from New Delhi.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Suhasini Raj is a reporter based in New Delhi who has covered India for The Times since 2014.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
