Kennedy Jr. set off a scandal, has withdrawn a request for a protective order against her former fiancé, the Politico correspondent Ryan Lizza.</p><p>Ms. Nuzzi, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr-new-york-magazine.html" title="">left</a> her role at New York magazine last month, filed a motion to dismiss the civil protection order on Friday in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. She had been granted a temporary protection order against Mr. Lizza on Oct. 1 after she claimed in a complaint that he had blackmailed and harassed her.</p><p>Mr. Lizza, who is Politico’s chief Washington correspondent and a co-author of the Playbook newsletter, has vehemently denied all the accusations. He said in a statement on Tuesday that Ms. Nuzzi had “taken the only course available to her and withdrawn her fabricated claims.”</p><p>Ms. Nuzzi, who was until recently the Washington correspondent for New York magazine, was placed on leave on Sept. 19 after her editors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr.html" title="">found out</a> about a relationship between her and Mr. Kennedy, who had been a candidate for president. Ms. Nuzzi had told them that the relationship had turned personal but was never physical. The magazine said in <a href="https://nymag.com/press/article/a-note-to-our-readers.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a note to readers</a> that it was “a violation of the magazine’s standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A representative for Mr. Kennedy, who has not spoken publicly about the claims, said at the time that Mr. Kennedy had “only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested.”</p><p>Mr. Lizza is on leave from Politico while the company conducts an internal investigation. A Politico spokesman had no update on Tuesday on the status of the investigation.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
