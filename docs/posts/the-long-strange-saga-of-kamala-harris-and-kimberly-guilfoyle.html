The vice president does not seem to have uttered a public word about Ms. Guilfoyle in years.</p><p>And modern political history is overstuffed with reductive and often sexist accounts of rivalries between professional women — the province of passing gossip and unfortunate allusions to “cat fights” — as if men were wholly incapable of ambition, conflict and petty grievance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yet as Ms. Harris and Ms. Guilfoyle find themselves, a quarter-century later, as political adversaries on the grandest scale, their intersecting early-career arcs reveal something more enduring about these onetime counterparts, their divergent paths and the political parties in which they ultimately rose.</p><p>This was the period, in the perpetual tinderbox of San Francisco politics, when Ms. Harris and Ms. Guilfoyle formed the outlines of the public figures they would become.</p><p>“Superstar women,” said Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor, who once dated Ms. Harris. “They represented the city.”</p><p>Relentlessly foresighted and instinctively reserved, Ms. Harris was a respected prosecutor who cast an eye for years toward the office’s top job as she entrenched herself among the city’s elite — an outsider becoming an insider in real time.</p><p>And Ms. Guilfoyle, the indefatigable daughter of a Bay Area political fixture, mused about leading the same district attorney’s office one day, friends recalled. (Ms. Guilfoyle said she never seriously considered a run.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Everybody was gearing up,” said Phil Matier, who was a longtime political scribe for The San Francisco Chronicle. “We were waiting to see if there was going to be a matchup between Kimberly and Kamala.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After previously working in the office, Ms. Harris was elected district attorney of San Francisco in 2003.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Liz Hafalia/The San Francisco Chronicle, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Around San Francisco, where Ms. Guilfoyle has lingered as a distant memory since her divorce from Mr. Newsom, those close to Ms. Harris are generally disinclined to revisit this chapter.</p><p>“I might have blocked it out completely,” said Andrea Dew Steele, a Democratic fund-raiser who has known Ms. Harris for decades.</p><p>“Say no more!” Mark Leno, a former California legislator and a friend of Ms. Harris’s, pleaded with a laugh when Ms. Guilfoyle was invoked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I knew they didn’t get along,” Rebecca Prozan, a top aide on Ms. Harris’s 2003 run for district attorney, said, before moving on quickly. “Kimberly’s been so good at refocusing on other things to remember about her.”</p><p>If this era remains more vivid for Ms. Guilfoyle, she has largely spared audiences the details, speaking ominously but vaguely in public appearances about her history with Ms. Harris.</p><p>“I watched it firsthand — she left San Francisco worse off,” Ms. Guilfoyle <a href="https://x.com/FloridaGOP/status/1832560231953666278" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in Florida</a> this month. “Her only goal is the new job, the next job, the next office.”</p><p>Privately, in the years after Ms. Harris became district attorney, Ms. Guilfoyle was sometimes more specific, allowing herself a rueful observation about her hometown, according to a former associate who heard it.</p><p>“I should have been D.A.,” Ms. Guilfoyle would say. “I should be D.A.”</p><h2 id="link-40ceea78">Spiky Politics</h2><p>All politics can be strange; San Francisco’s is stranger, spikier, more claustrophobic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The roughly seven-by-seven-mile city of Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein and Mr. Newsom has long punched above its proverbial weight — and has occasionally tested the bounds of that metaphor, with reported fistfights among politicos and a former district attorney, Terence Hallinan, known as “Kayo” (as in “KO,” for knockout) because of his boxing background.</p><p>Ms. Harris, as she takes care to point out, was not from San Francisco. She was born in Oakland and began her career as a prosecutor in Alameda County. She joined Mr. Hallinan’s office across the bay in 1998, after which the district attorney sometimes congratulated himself openly on his good judgment.</p><p>“Great hire,” Mr. Hallinan would say of Ms. Harris. (“Reflecting some glory back on him,” Fred Gardner, a former Hallinan aide, remembered.)</p><p>By this time, Ms. Harris had already enshrined herself as a regular on the San Francisco society circuit, with its galas and Gettys and opera after-parties. Ms. Guilfoyle — whose father, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-political-adviser-Anthony-Guilfoyle-dies-3182637.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anthony Guilfoyle</a>, was a political adviser known as “The Godfather” — had her own early experience in some of the city’s esteemed spaces.</p><p>“Kamala eventually got in the same political circles — she didn’t start there,” Mr. Brown said. “They were still trying to find out exactly what made sense for them beyond all of the social activities and being part of the ‘first group’ in the city, so to speak.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ms. Guilfoyle, a few years Ms. Harris’s junior, briefly worked for Mr. Hallinan’s predecessor in San Francisco before joining the prosecutor’s office in Los Angeles.</p><p>Around 2000, she spoke to Mr. Hallinan’s team about returning.</p><p>This is where accounts begin to collide. Ms. Guilfoyle has said she received a call from Ms. Harris a short time later claiming she had budgetary authority in the office and no spot for her.</p><p>“She was threatened,” Ms. Guilfoyle said in the interview. “Most things in life make sense — jealousy, envy.” (Ms. Harris’s presidential campaign declined to comment.)</p><p>Ms. Guilfoyle said she immediately told others in the office what Ms. Harris had said. “They’re furious,” she recalled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gavin Newsom, then the mayor of San Francisco, Ms. Harris and Ms. Guilfoyle, all pictured on Thanksgiving 2004, were rising political stars in the city.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Chiu/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Brains-brio-beauty-and-wounded-feelings-2512633.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> she never discouraged Ms. Guilfoyle from joining the office or suggested she could not have a job.</p><p>Mr. Hallinan, who <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Former-SF-DA-Terence-Hallinan-a-brawler-and-14984046.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">died in 2020</a>, said that Ms. Harris “forbade” him from hiring Ms. Guilfoyle even though he was her boss. He brought Ms. Guilfoyle aboard, anyway.</p><p>“Timing is everything!” Mr. Hallinan wrote in a note explaining the hire to Mr. Gardner, who recently shared it.</p><p>What no one has supplied is a compelling explanation of what transpired between Ms. Guilfoyle and Ms. Harris in the first place.</p><p>People who spoke to both women at the time said the fraught dynamic seemed to grow out of a personal conflict in their social circles, not any professional clash. (Ms. Guilfoyle’s diagnosis is more straightforward — and, perhaps conveniently, fit for an attack ad: “She wasn’t supportive about lifting women up.”)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Whatever the origins, they would not be colleagues for long. By late 2000, Ms. Harris had left the office, frustrated by what she would later describe as an unruly and dysfunctional culture under Mr. Hallinan.</p><p>In short order, Ms. Harris was consulting with friends about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/us/politics/kamala-harris-san-francisco-da.html" title="">a run for his job</a>, forming a fund-raising network drawn from a hulking Filofax full of estimable social contacts.</p><p>“Determined and ambitious,” said Denise Hale, a friend of Ms. Harris’s and a grande dame of San Francisco high society. “Thank God.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In her first campaign, Ms. Harris found herself running against her former boss.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Kepka/San Francisco Chronicle, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Ms. Harris’s farewell party was a study in political maneuvering.
