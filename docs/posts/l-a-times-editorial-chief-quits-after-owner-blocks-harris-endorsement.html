In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.”</p><p>Ms. Garza said the editorial board had planned to endorse Ms. Harris, but Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of The Los Angeles Times, decided this month that the newspaper would not make any endorsement for president. The paper did not explain to readers why it was not issuing an endorsement.</p><p>Dr. Soon-Shiong, who bought The Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million, said in a social media post on Wednesday that the editorial board had not followed through on a directive to provide information including “a factual analysis of all the positive and negative policies by each candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“With this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being President for the next four years,” he said. “Instead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Patrick Soon-Shiong has owned The Los Angeles Times since 2018, when he paid $500 million for it.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Paul Morris/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Garza responded to Dr. Soon-Shiong in a text to The New York Times, saying: “What he outlines in that tweet is not an endorsement, or even an editorial.”</p><p>The Los Angeles Times has endorsed a Democrat for president in every election cycle since 2008. This year it has made <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-09-10/los-angeles-times-elections-endorsements-2024-november" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a series of endorsements</a> in state, city and county races.</p><p>Semafor first <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/22/2024/los-angeles-times-wont-endorse-for-president" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that The Los Angeles Times was skipping this year’s presidential endorsement.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/about/pressreleases/story/2024-04-10/mariel-garza-to-lead-times-editorial-board-and-susan-brenneman-named-op-ed-editor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Garza</a>, who joined the paper’s editorial board in 2015, was appointed editorials editor in April.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In her resignation letter, which The Columbia Journalism Review published in full, Ms. Garza said it mattered that the largest newspaper in California declined to endorse “in a race this important.
