The cruelty is the point.”</p><p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration said that El Salvador would receive $6 million for taking in hundreds of deportees, most of whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/trump-deportations-venezuela-gang.html" title="">the U.S. government</a> said were members of the Venezuelan criminal group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/americas/tren-de-aragua-gang-venezuela.html" title="">Tren de Aragua</a>, without offering evidence or the detainees’ names.
