How’d it go yesterday? Was the turkey moist? The gravy smooth? You enjoy the side dishes, the dinner rolls? Were the pies abundant? Did Cousin Amy keep her cool?</p><p>I hope so. I hope your Thanksgiving was bathed in the spirit of the holiday — that you gave thanks and were given thanks, that you cooked well or, at any rate, ate well, that you got some time to yourself and with those who care about you. I hope that you were able to sleep in this morning, and that you arose rested and ready for the long slide that leads from today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/money/best-early-black-friday-deals-2024-1114/" title="">Black Friday</a>, to the Wednesday dawn of 2025.</p><p>Mostly, I hope you have plenty of <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/642361-thanksgiving-leftovers-recipes" title="">leftovers</a>. To some — and absolutely to me — they’re the very best part of Thanksgiving.</p><p>I start with a leftovers sandwich. For years, I assembled mine on the fly, between slices of toasted English muffin: swipes of mayo and congealed gravy, a daub of cranberry sauce, a shred of turkey, a spoonful of stuffing. I’d smash that together and eat it in three bites, leaving the kitchen feeling as if I could go pro.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But then Sohla El-Waylly came along with a recipe for <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021605-best-thanksgiving-leftovers-sandwich" title="">the </a><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021605-best-thanksgiving-leftovers-sandwich" title=""><em>best</em></a><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021605-best-thanksgiving-leftovers-sandwich" title=""> Thanksgiving leftovers sandwich</a> (above) to show me how professionals actually do these things.

I’ll make <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023669-instant-pot-congee" title="">turkey congee</a> with white pepper, perhaps the pressure cooker’s highest calling, a comforting porridge whether you’re eating in the Montana chill or the shower-room heat of a Florida night.</p><p>Maybe <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022741-turkey-tetrazzini" title="">turkey tetrazzini</a>? <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018424-turkey-pho" title="">Turkey pho</a>? <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021606-stuffing-panzanella-with-cranberry-vinaigrette" title="">A stuffing panzanella with cranberry vinaigrette</a>?
