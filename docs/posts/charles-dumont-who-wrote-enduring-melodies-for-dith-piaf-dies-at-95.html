He was 95.</p><p>His death was confirmed by his daughter Sherkane Dumont.</p><p>Mr. Dumont had a prolific career, writing melodies for the likes of Jacques Brel, Juliette Gréco and Barbra Streisand and music for French television and film. In the 1970s, he embarked on an award-winning career as romantic crooner.</p><p>Still, it was the roughly 30 songs that he, with the lyricist Michel Vaucaire, wrote for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1963/10/12/archives/song-stylist-47-cast-a-spell-over-many-audiences-tragedy-marked.html" title="">Piaf</a> — the diminutive and radiant chanteuse known as the Little Sparrow — that, by his own admission, defined his career<em>. </em>“My mother gave birth to me, but Édith Piaf brought me into the world,” Mr. Dumont said in a 2015 interview with Agence France-Presse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzy2wZSg5ZM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien” (“No, I Regret Nothing”), introduced in 1960, became a definitive song for a definitive French singer, a woman who became not just a global star but also a cultural ambassador for her country.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>With its martial solemnity, the song had the feel of a patriotic anthem, which gave power and drama to lyrics that express, in blunt and defiant terms, a rejection of past memories, both good and bad, while moving toward a new future.</p><p>The song powerfully captured Piaf’s own perseverance through a troubled life that included being abandoned at birth and raised in a brothel, only to endure an adulthood marked by personal calamities, physical ailments, and drug and alcohol use before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1963/10/12/archives/song-stylist-47-cast-a-spell-over-many-audiences-tragedy-marked.html" title="">her death at 47</a> in 1963.</p><p>Unlike Piaf’s life, the song ends on an upbeat note, as its protagonist resolves to discard past romances to find new love.</p><p>“I wanted something grandiose, something revolutionary, something that would <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/features/charles-dumont-regrets-too-few-to-mention-90460.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">make me famous</a>,” Mr. Dumont recalled in a 2003 interview with the British newspaper The Independent. “I played the notes and Vaucaire just started saying ‘rien de rien,’ and it became a song about the triumph of love, the everlasting hope of love.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Such a glorious outcome, for both the songwriters and the singer, seemed highly unlikely in October 1960, when Mr. Dumont and Mr. Vaucaire dropped in on Piaf’s home on Boulevard Lannes, in the exclusive 16th Arrondissement of Paris, hoping to finally sell her a song after multiple rejections.</p><p>At 44, Piaf was racked by pain after a car accident and expressed little apparent interest in returning to the stage — certainly not with a song by Mr. Dumont, whom she had previously dismissed as “a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-man-who-made-the-little-sparrow-fly-2114257.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mechanical songwriter</a> of no great talent,” he recalled in a 2010 interview with The Independent.</p><p>That day, Piaf’s secretary had already informed them that the meeting was canceled when the singer piped up in a weary voice from her bedroom and agreed to see them. It took an hour for the frail figure to emerge, Mr. Dumont said, and when she did, she told them. “I’ll hear only one song — just one.” Mr. Dumont raced to the piano and began belting out “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien,” which he and Mr. Vaucaire had written with Piaf in mind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Dumont with Piaf after the Paris concert in December 1960 at which she performed his song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien” for the first time.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">STF/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“When I finished,” he said in 2010, “she asked, rather rudely, ‘Did you really write that song? You?’ Then she made me play it over and over again, maybe five or six times. She said that it was magnificent, wonderful. That it was made for her. That it was her. That it would be her resurrection.”</p><p>Charles Gaston Dumont was born on March 26, 1929, in Cahors, a commune in southwestern France, before his father, a boilermaker, and his mother, a coffee roaster, moved the family to Toulouse, about 70 miles to the south.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>An early fascination with Louis Armstrong steered young Charles to jazz, a music he dared play only in secret during the German occupation of France, given the Nazi decree that it was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/20/1200547564/swingtime-for-hitler-explores-the-nazis-use-of-jazz-as-a-propaganda-tool" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">degenerate music</a>.</p><p>After World War II, he trained as a trumpet player at a music conservatory in Toulouse before moving to Paris to carve out a career. His trumpet-playing days ended with damage to his throat after a tonsil operation, so he turned his attention to organ, piano and songwriting. He teamed up with Mr. Vaucaire in 1956.</p><p>In December 1960, Piaf took the stage at the Olympia concert hall in Paris and performed “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien” for the first time. She also performed other songs by Mr. Dumont and Mr. Vaucaire, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgvEV9B-IEw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Mon Dieu”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CX-4A43H-k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Les Flonflons du Bal.”</a></p><p>“Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien” became a chart-topper in France and was eventually covered in more than a dozen languages, including in English as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCrYvI-xhVs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“No Regrets,”</a> recorded by Shirley Bassey and other singers. In 1962, Mr. Dumont collaborated with Piaf on writing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRP1jZMWDQg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Les Amants,”</a> which they sang together on record.</p><p>After Piaf’s death in 1963, Mr. Dumont and Mr. Vaucaire routed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzf-U_bOWvk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“La Mur,”</a> a song they had written for Piaf about the building of the Berlin Wall, to Ms. Streisand, who included it in 1966 on the album “Je M’appelle Barbra,” on which she sang mostly in French. Mr. Dumont also wrote the scores for many movies, including Jacques Tati’s acclaimed 1971 comedy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/17/archives/tatis-terrific-traffictatis-terrific-traffic.html" title="">“Traffic.”</a></p><p>Starting in the early 1970s, Mr. Dumont also made his mark as a solo artist, releasing a string of albums. He won a Prix de l’Académie Charles-Cros music award in 1973 and earned gold status for “Une Chanson” (1976) and “Les Amours Impossibles” (1978). In 2012, he published a memoir, “Non, Je Ne Regrette Toujours Rien” (“No, I Still Regret Nothing).”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In addition to his daughter Sherkane, he is survived by his partner, Florence Lemaître; two sons, Philippe and Frédéric; another daughter, Maricha Dumont; and six grandchildren.</p><p>Despite his success, Mr. Dumont never could escape the shadow of his most famous song. Nor did he want to.</p><p>“I was reborn with that song,” he said in the 2010 interview with The Independent. “It transformed my life. It has been my calling card all over the world. It changed me from a jobbing songwriter, a fabricator of songs, to someone who had the confidence, and the opportunity, to write what I wanted and what I felt.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
