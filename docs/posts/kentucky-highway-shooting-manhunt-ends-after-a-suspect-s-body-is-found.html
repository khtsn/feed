The authorities found items with the body that were believed to belong to the suspect, Mr. Burnett said. </p><p>“The people of Laurel County can rest easy — much easier — knowing that this manhunt has now come to a conclusion,” he said. </p><p>How long the body had been there before it was discovered was unclear, and authorities were investigating the cause of death, Mr. Burnett said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police have identified the suspect of the shooting as Joseph A. Couch, 32. They said that on Sept. 7, Mr. Couch <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/kentucky-shooting-manhunt-schools-closed.html" title="">perched</a> on a cliff overlooking Interstate 75 about eight miles north of London, Ky., and opened fire. One of the wounded was shot in the face, and another was shot in the chest. A dozen vehicles were riddled with gunfire. </p><p>According to a police affidavit in support of arrest warrants, Mr. Couch <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/us/shooting-kentucky-highway.html" title="">purchased</a> an AR-15-style rifle and 1,000 rounds of ammunition just hours before the shooting. He then sent a series of alarming text messages, including one that read: “I’m going to kill a lot of people. Well try at least.” </p><p>Officials found an S.U.V. registered to Mr. Couch at the top of a hill near the interstate on Saturday night. Deputy Gilbert Acciardo of the sheriff’s office in Laurel County, which includes London, said an AR-15-style rifle was found on Sunday “some distance” from the vehicle.</p><p>Officials added that they believed that the attack was planned but that it was not targeted at specific individuals, and that Mr. Couch’s motive was unclear.</p><p>The manhunt, which on Wednesday stretched into its 12th day, began shortly after the shooting in a remote wooded area near London, a city of about 8,000 people located roughly an hour south of Lexington. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Authorities deployed dozens of officers, along with search dogs, a helicopter and a drone equipped with an infrared scanner. The search was complicated by the area’s difficult and remote terrain, authorities said, which included caves, rocky slopes and dense vegetation. </p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Burnett said, troopers had been searching in the area all day and had noticed vultures and a strong odor. While trying to locate the source, the troopers ran into a couple who were also in the area looking for Mr. Couch, Mr. Burnett said. The couple, Shelia and Fred McCoy, had been documenting their multiday search on YouTube.</p><p>The couple will receive a $25,000 reward for their role in locating the body, Mr. Burnett said. </p><p>The fact that the suspect remained at large for almost two weeks left the community in London anxious. The police warned residents to lock their doors and keep their porch lights on at night. Several schools canceled classes. Football games were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/interstate-shooting-kentucky-e0eccb522ac2e58f9ff254a93edd8f3d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called off</a> at some high schools, and the police stepped up their presence at others. </p><p>Mr. Couch served in the Army Reserve as a combat engineer from 2013 to 2019, but was never deployed. According to court records, he has several charges on his criminal record and was arrested most recently in February. In that incident, he was charged with terroristic threatening after coming outside with a rifle and threatening to kill a man and his dog following a confrontation about Mr. Couch throwing a rock at the animal.</p><p>Tricia Fulks Kelley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Yan Zhuang<!-- --> and <!-- -->Amanda Holpuch<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Selig is a Times national reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-selig">More about Kate Selig</a></span></p></div><div><p>Hank Sanders is a Times reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hank-sanders">More about Hank Sanders</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
