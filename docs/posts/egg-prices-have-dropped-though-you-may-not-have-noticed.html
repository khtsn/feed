<p> U.S. average wholesale price of eggs</p>
</div></section><p><time datetime="2025-03-18T12:19:30-04:00"><span>March 18, 2025</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The wholesale price of eggs has dropped sharply since the beginning of March after soaring for months, but it may take a few weeks for grocery shoppers to see the decline.</p><p>Wholesale egg prices, which are what retailers pay to procure eggs, <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have fallen</a> to a national average of just over $4 for a dozen large white eggs, down from a peak of more than $8 at the end of February, according to data from the Agriculture Department released last week.</p><p>But because eggs typically have a four-week shelf life, it may be the end of March before retail prices start to drop, said Jeremy Horpedahl, an associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. Some stores, he added, may not lower prices until their current inventory sells out.</p><p>Economists said the decline in wholesale prices, which are still above long-term averages, was very likely fueled by a combination of factors: bird flu’s coming under control, weaker consumer demand, ramped-up supply and producer pricing decisions. The Agriculture Department noted that there had been no significant outbreaks of avian flu in March, and economists say any new outbreaks could push up prices again. The virus has forced egg producers to cull tens of millions of hens since late last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In February, the retail price of eggs rose 10.4 percent from the previous month, continuing a monthslong climb, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released last week. </p><p>Economists noted that prices might not come down evenly across the country. Areas with competing grocery stores might see egg prices fall more quickly, Mr. Horpedahl said, while those dominated by a single chain — with the power to keep prices high for longer — may not. Retail prices may also depend on grocery chains’ strategies, with some opting to keep prices lower to entice customers into stores.</p><p>“They can pass the savings of wholesale prices onto us entirely, or not at all, or somewhere in between,” said David Anderson, a professor of economics and business at Centre College in Danville, Ky. High demand for eggs leading up to Easter may keep prices elevated through then, he said.</p><p>President Trump, who made lowering grocery prices a key part of his campaign, has jumped on the wholesale price trend, citing the drop in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/fact-check-trump-justice-immigration-crime-eggs.html" title="">speech</a> at the Justice Department last week. At the same time, his sweeping tariffs have stoked concern about an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-tariffs-prices-consumers.html" title="">uptick in prices</a> for a host of products, including grocery staples.</p><p>The price of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/economy/inflation-food-prices.html" title="">eggs and other groceries</a> created angst during the Biden administration, becoming a top concern among voters ahead of the 2024 election. An outbreak of bird flu in 2022, along with increasing fuel, feed and packaging costs linked to the coronavirus pandemic, pushed wholesale egg prices up to nearly $5 a dozen at their peak. Although the spike in egg prices was smaller than the recent surge, overall inflation was higher, piling pressure onto household budgets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Egg producers have blamed the spread of avian flu for tighter supplies. United Egg Producers, the industry’s trade association, noted that the industry had lost more than 40 million egg-laying hens in 2024 and 31 million in just the first two months of this year as the virus accelerated.</p><p>Mr. Anderson said the bird flu had hit supply in “dramatic ways.” But at the same time, he added, “the industry may see the bird flu epidemic as a cover for additional price hikes that aren’t necessarily needed.”</p><p>“Part of it is they’re really dealing with a crisis,” he said. “Part of it might be, ‘Do we have some cover to keep our prices artificially high?’”</p><p>The Justice Department is in the early stages of an antitrust <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/business/us-egg-prices-investigation.html" title="">investigation</a> looking into whether major egg producers have shared information about pricing and supply that contributed to a spike in prices. Some lawmakers and advocacy groups had previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/egg-prices-bird-flu-producers.html" title="">called for federal regulators</a> to investigate the industry’s pricing practices.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Egg Prices Fall, but Shoppers May Not See Drop for Weeks<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on Eggs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Price Drop:</strong> Wholesale egg prices are about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/egg-prices-wholesale.html">half of what they were last month</a>.
