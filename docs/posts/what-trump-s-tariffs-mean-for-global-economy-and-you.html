</div></section></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Since re-entering office, President Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs in an effort to rewire the global economy.</p><p>At 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, his most aggressive moves yet took effect, imposing double-digit rates on dozens of countries. About 13 hours later, he said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-china-stock-market/b6823996-24fd-5a11-af06-45e95e808117?smid=url-share" title="">halt implementation of those tariffs</a> for the next 90 days, citing new talks with foreign nations on trade. </p><p>Mr. Trump kept new tariffs on China in place and he said he would raise them even further, to a total of 125 percent, after Beijing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/china-tariffs-us-trump.html?smid=url-share" title="">announced a new round of retaliation</a>. Those levies were on top of other global tariffs he kept in place, including for steel and aluminum products, as well as a 10 percent base line for virtually all imports from around the world. </p><p>The growing trade tensions have created extreme volatility in financial markets. Economists have been worrying that the United States could slip into recession, especially if tariffs escalate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-685e9178">Who pays for tariffs, and where does the money go?</h2><p>A tariff is a government surcharge on products imported from other countries.</p><p>Tariffs are paid by the companies that import the goods. The revenue from U.S. tariffs is paid by U.S. importers to the U.S. Treasury Department.</p><p>For example, if Walmart imports a $100 shoe from Vietnam — which faces a 46 percent tariff — Walmart will owe $46.00 in tariffs to the U.S. government.</p><p>What happens next?</p><ul><li><p>Walmart could try to force the cost onto the Vietnamese shoe manufacturer, by telling it Walmart will pay less for the product.</p></li><li><p>Walmart could cut into its own profit margins and absorb the cost of the tariff.</p></li><li><p>Walmart could raise the price of the shoes at its stores.</p></li><li><p>Or, some combination of the above.</p></li></ul><p>Economists found that, when Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term, most of that cost was passed on to consumers. But economic studies found that his tariffs on foreign steel were a bit different; only about half of those costs were passed on to customers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-5e62fe02">Why is Trump imposing tariffs?</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s point of view appears to be that any trade deficit — the value of goods the U.S. imports from a country, minus what the U.S. sends it as exports — is bad. He has long described bilateral trade deficits as examples of America being “ripped off” or “subsidizing” other countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-6"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="datawrapper_56b6C" data-id="100000009944937" data-source-id="100000009944937"><div slug="datawrapper_56b6C" data-sourceid="100000009944937" id="embed-id-100000009944937">
      
    

<p>America’s Trade <span>Deficits</span> and <span>Surpluses</span> With Other Countries</p>
</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The president and his advisers say their goal is to make the tariffs so painful that they force companies to make their products in the United States. They argue that this will create more American jobs and push up wages.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has also described tariffs as an all-purpose tool, forcing Canada, Mexico and China to crack down on the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. The president also maintains that tariffs will rake in huge sums of revenue that the government can use to pay for tax cuts.</p><p>Economists say that tariffs cannot simultaneously achieve all of the goals that Mr. Trump has expressed. In fact, many of his aims contradict one another. The same tariffs that are supposed to boost U.S. manufacturing are also making life painful for U.S. manufacturers, by disrupting their supply chains and raising the cost of their raw materials.</p><p>“All of these tariffs are internally inconsistent with each other,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. “So what is the real priority? Because you can’t have all those things happen at once.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5a94bc96">How have U.S. trading partners responded?</h2><p>The Trump administration has signaled that it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/trump-tariffs-greer.html" title="">ready to negotiate deals</a>, saying that 70 governments had approached the United States to try to roll the levies back. Other countries are fighting back.</p><p><strong>China</strong> is now imposing tariffs totaling 84 percent on all U.S. products, raising levies by 50 percent to match Mr. Trump’s latest tit-for-tat increase. It also barred more than a dozen American companies from doing business in China or with Chinese companies, and halted chicken imports from five of America’s biggest exporters.</p><p>China and the United States have now taken a series of steps in just one week that until very recently would have been almost unimaginable. For nearly half a century after the death of Mao Zedong, the two countries seemed on a course toward ever greater economic integration. Some experts even referred to the partnership of China and America as “Chimerica.”</p><p><strong>Canada </strong>has vowed to defend its workers, businesses and economy from new tariffs and threats from Mr. Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney recently said it was clear that the United States was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/27/business/trump-tariffs" title="">no longer a reliable partner</a>.” In March, after U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs took effect, the Canadian government said that it would impose new retaliatory tariffs on $20 billion worth of U.S. imports, on top of the 25 percent tariffs announced previously.</p><p><strong>Mexico</strong> made a major effort to fend off tariffs, sending more than two dozen accused cartel leaders to the United States to face criminal charges and dispatching troops to fentanyl laboratories and the U.S. border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-68a233c2">What is happening with stock markets?</h2><p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was on the verge of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/economy/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html" title="">bear market</a>, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its last high, before rallying on news of the 90-day pause in many of the Trump tariffs on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1b63d4eb">How could tariffs affect consumer prices?</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s tariffs target countries that supply a wide variety of goods to the United States. For American families, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/business/trump-tariffs-higher-prices.html" title="">the very likely result is higher prices</a> at grocery stores, car dealerships, electronics retailers and clothing outlets.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-cars-auto-industry.html" title="">already sending tremors through the auto industry</a>, prompting companies to stop shipping cars to the United States, shut down factories in Canada and Mexico and lay off workers in Michigan and other states.</p><p>Nearly half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as well as nearly 60 percent of the parts used in vehicles assembled in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Since the North American free trade zone was created in 1994, American and foreign-owned automakers have built <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/04/business/economy/car-tariffs.html" title="">supply chains that cross the borders</a> of the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-16"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="car-import-embed" data-id="100000010034828" data-source-id="100000010034828"><div slug="car-import-embed" data-sourceid="100000010034828" id="embed-id-100000010034828">
