In Tina, a no-nonsense chef in “The Bear,” she found a true breakout role. In her acceptance speech, she thanked the showrunners for the part they played in her late-career success, saying, “Thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me a new life with this show.”</p><p>Best supporting actor in a limited series or TV movie</p><h2 id="link-3dcf2713">Lamorne Morris, ‘Fargo’</h2><p>Morris is perhaps best known for playing Winston on seven seasons of “New Girl,” and he co-hosts <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mess-around-with-hannah-and-lamorne/id1602740285" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a podcast</a> related to his time on that comedy. Though he has an array of credits, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/arts/television/lamorne-morris-favorites.html" title="">the Hulu series “Woke”</a> is among his most recent. Morris won his first Emmy for his work as a dependable North Dakota law enforcement officer, Witt Farr, in “Fargo.”</p><p>Best actress in a drama</p><h2 id="link-54cbf5ea"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/arts/television/anna-sawai-shogun-emmy-award.html" title="">Anna Sawai</a>, ‘Shogun’</h2><p>Sawai acknowledged after her Emmy nomination that she had “bad impostor syndrome” but that the recognition had instilled her with more confidence. “It makes me want to keep telling stories that have a big impact on the people who haven’t been seen,” she said. Sawai has appeared in several episodes of “Pachinko,” adapted from the novel by Min Jin Lee, and also played a part in “F9,” an installment of the “Fast and Furious” franchise.</p><p>Best actor in a drama</p><h2 id="link-3678f764">Hiroyuki Sanada, ‘Shogun’</h2><p>Sanada, 63, has been acting for decades, both internationally and in Hollywood, where his credits include “Westworld,” “Avengers: Endgame” “John Wick: Chapter 4” and “The Last Samurai.” But he won his first Emmy on Sunday. In fact, he won two: one for best actor (for playing Yoshii Toranaga) and another as a listed producer on “Shogun,” which took home the best drama award.</p><p>Best actor in a limited series or TV movie</p><h2 id="link-21e8f53b"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/arts/television/baby-reindeer-true-story.html" title="">Richard Gadd</a>, ‘Baby Reindeer’</h2><p>Gadd won an Olivier Award — the British equivalent of the Tonys — four years ago for his monologue about a woman who sent him tens of thousands of emails and hundreds of hours of voice mail messages after he served her a free drink at a bar. Now he has won three Emmys for that story, writing and acting in what became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/arts/television/baby-reindeer-true-story.html" title="">a hit for Netflix</a>. Gadd, a Scottish comedian, primarily had guest TV roles beforehand, although he has also written an episode of “Sex Education.”</p></div></div>
