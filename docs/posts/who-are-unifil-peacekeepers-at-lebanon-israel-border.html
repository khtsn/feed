data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Two members of a United Nations peacekeeping mission operating along Lebanon’s border with Israel were injured on Thursday after an Israeli tank fired on one of the group’s observation towers, <a href="https://x.com/UNIFIL_/status/1844350050656452661" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.N. officials said.</a></p><p>It was the most serious incident involving the international force since Israel warned it to relocate from Lebanese positions near where it said Hezbollah fighters had launched rockets into northern Israel. The U.N. forces rejected the request to move, a spokesman said.</p><p>The U.N. has kept the peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, in southern Lebanon since 1978. Its mission is largely observational, though its mandate was expanded in 2006 at the end of the last war between Israel and Hezbollah, an armed group backed by Iran.</p><p>Over the past year, the peacekeepers have found themselves increasingly in the middle of cross-border strikes. A day after its ally, Hamas, launched the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, and Israel returned fire. Last week, Israeli ground troops entered Lebanon to rout out the militants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is a look at the challenges faced by the peacekeepers at an increasingly volatile border.</p><h2 id="link-52659a17">What is UNIFIL’s mission?</h2><p>The United Nations Interim Peacekeeping Force in Lebanon is an international body of over <a href="https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-troop-contributing-countries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10,000</a> civilian and military personnel from 50 countries assigned to prevent violations along the border between Lebanon and Israel. That 75-mile stretch is often called the Blue Line.</p><p>A U.N. <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2006/sc8808.doc.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolution from 2006</a> includes language authorizing the force to “ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind.”</p><p>The group is charged by the U.N. with keeping out of the area any weapons or fighters. But over the past decade, the United States and Israel have argued that the peacekeepers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/world/middleeast/united-nations-security-council-peacekeepers-lebanon-hezbollah-israel.html?timespastHighlight=UNIFIL" title="">largely ineffective</a> at preventing Hezbollah from stockpiling and firing rockets from the territory they patrol.</p><p>UNIFIL is supposed to prevent violations in the border zone and report breeches to the U.N. Security Council. Although they are armed, the peacekeepers are generally restricted to using force only when their safety or the safety of civilians is in immediate danger.</p><h2 id="link-1a2ac172">What’s happening now?</h2><p>During its invasion into southern Lebanon last week, the Israeli military established new positions near one of the UNIFIL bases, according to U.N. officials. The new positions can be seen on satellite imagery reviewed by The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A U.N. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/07/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon/israeli-troops-have-set-up-near-un-peacekeepers-in-lebanon-satellite-images-show?smid=url-share" title="">spokesman</a> said the Israeli military had been firing at Hezbollah positions from those locations, putting the peacekeepers increasingly at risk. He said that the Israeli military had asked the U.N. forces to relocate, but that they had declined to do so.</p><p>Although attacks on U.N. personnel violate international law, Hezbollah has for a year launched rockets into northern Israel from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/12/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war-news/un-peacekeepers-are-facing-increased-attacks-along-the-israel-lebanon-border?smid=url-share" title="">close to U.N. positions</a> in southern Lebanon. That complicates the rules of engagement.</p><p>On Thursday, UNIFIL said that Israeli tank fire hit an observation tower at the force’s headquarters in Naqoura, Lebanon, and that soldiers had also struck the entrance of a bunker at a nearby base where peacekeepers were sheltering.</p><p>“Any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law,” the U.N. force said in a <a href="https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-statement-10-october" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. It said it was following up with the Israeli military.</p><p>The Israeli military confirmed that its troops were operating near UNIFIL positions on Thursday morning and said it “instructed the U.N. forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, following which the forces opened fire in the area.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eve Sampson is a reporter covering international news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eve-sampson">More about Eve Sampson</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/united-nations">United Nations</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Separated by a Few Miles, and the War:</strong><strong> </strong>A Palestinian family has been stuck at opposite ends of the Gaza Strip, with their young children, for most of the yearlong conflict. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/world/middleeast/gaza-family-separation.html">The emotional toll has been devastating</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden and Netanyahu Speak:</strong><strong> </strong>The conversation, their first in two months, focused on Israel’s plans to retaliate against Iran for a missile attack and carried the weight of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel.html">the worst relationship between the United States and Israel in years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.N.
