Barry, said in a statement.</p><p>These results were unsurprising to many dementia researchers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/health/alzheimers-simufilam-cassava-sciences.html" title="">who had questioned why the trial had been allowed</a> to proceed in the first place, since much of the drug’s underlying science had been called into question.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Studies that once seemed to support the drug have been retracted from scientific journals. A consultant researcher who helped conduct some of the drug’s foundational studies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/health/wang-cassava-alzheimers-fraud.html" title="">was charged</a> with fraud by a federal grand jury for allegedly falsifying data to obtain research grants.</p><p>In September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/health/alzheimers-simufilam-cassava-sciences.html" title="">the company settled</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations that Cassava had made misleading statements about the results of earlier clinical trial data. However, the company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.</p><p>Even so, the company forged ahead with its Phase 3 clinical trial — typically the last evaluation before the Food and Drug Administration decides whether to approve a medication for public use — and maintained that there was still research and clinical results that suggested the drug could prove valuable.</p><p>Hopes in the drug’s efficacy were dashed by Monday’s results, though the company said the trial still showed the drug was safe.</p><p>Cassava’s future now appears to be in flux, as simufilam was the company’s only drug in clinical trials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Following the company’s investor call Monday morning, Cassava’s stock price dropped more than 80 percent, a blow to the company’s loyal investors, who once valued the company at more than $5 billion.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
