    <h1>Slightly Higher Inflation Rate Is Expected for October</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fed officials are responsible for maintaining low and stable inflation and full employment. They raised interest rates sharply in 2022 and 2023 to try to slow the economy and pull rapid price increases under control. They began cutting rates this year as inflation slowed, lowering borrowing costs in September and at their meeting this month. Interest rates are <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now set to</a> a range of 4.5 to 4.75 percent.</p><p>But officials have been careful not to declare victory — especially when many American consumers are still feeling pain from elevated prices. The slowdown in inflation means that prices are no longer climbing as quickly, but they are still noticeably higher than they were just a few years ago.</p><p>“Inflation has come way down, the economy is still strong here, wages are moving up but at a sustainable level,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20241107.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last week</a>. “But it will be some time,” he added, “before people, you know, regain their confidence and feel that.”</p><p>Popular anger about inflation was obvious at the polls last week, as voters ousted Democrats and elected Donald J. Trump to the White House. Both surveys and exit polls showed that the economy and inflation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/trump-inflation-economy.html" title="">were major concerns</a> for Americans as they headed into the election.</p><p>Of course, Mr. Trump’s win could shake up the economic outlook — including the path for inflation.</p><p>Many economists have warned that some of his promises, including much higher tariffs, could reignite inflation.</p></div></div>
