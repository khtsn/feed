But she always knew when the U.S. Open was underway at the end of August.</p><p>“When I was out in the city for my internships, I would see the hats,” Ms. Riddle said.</p><p>Ms. Riddle, 27, an influencer and the girlfriend of Taylor Fritz, the top-ranked American in men’s tennis, is now the owner of two different examples of the tournament’s signature piece of merchandise: a basic ball cap featuring the year and a flaming-tennis-ball logo.</p><p>Each year, thousands of U.S. Open hats leave the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens on fans’ sweaty heads. By early September, the hats trickle into the city’s gyms and onto its pickleball courts. </p><p>Ms. Riddle has a blue one and a white one in her vast closet of tennis apparel. A camouflage version has caught her eye, but she is not yet convinced: “I don’t know how I feel about it,” she said, laughing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Each hat costs $40, a steep price for fans who may also be balancing the cost of tickets and the tournament’s other marquee accessory, the $23 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/sports/tennis/us-open-honey-deuce.html" title="">Honey Deuce cocktail</a>. But many consider the bragging rights worth it: More than 200,000 U.S. Open hats are expected to be sold this year, said Mary Ryan, the senior director of merchandise and licensing for the United States Tennis Association.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Heshy Zweig got hats for himself and his daughters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Xinyue Hu went with a mesh-back version of the 2024 hat.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We sell the heck out of them,” said Ms. Ryan, who last year placed an emergency hat order mid-tournament to keep up with demand. “It’s not uncommon to see someone walking away with six or 12 hats.”</p><p>On a sunny Friday during Fan Week, when the grounds of the tournament are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/nyregion/usopen-free-week.html" title="">open to the public for free</a>, customers streamed into a merchandise store outside Arthur Ashe Stadium. Its back wall featured an array 30 hats wide by four hats tall of black, green, lilac, tie dye and sequined headwear. (There are around 60 colors and styles, Ms. Ryan said.)</p><p>Heshy Zweig, 49, who had come from Lawrence, N.Y., tried on a navy hat for himself and handed white and green ones to his two daughters. He picked up a U.S. Open-branded rubber ducky and noticed that even the toy was wearing a hat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“You <em>have</em> to buy a hat,” his daughter Ava, 19, said.</p><p>Lui Suansing, who was visiting from Manila, carried a stack of 10 caps for himself and his friends.
