It did not provide further details, citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/arts/music/smokey-robinson-criminal-investigation.html" title="">a criminal investigation that the sheriff’s office opened</a> into Mr. Robinson this month.</p><p>News of a previous allegation comes weeks after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/smokey-robinson-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html" title="">four women filed a lawsuit</a> accusing Mr. Robinson of sexually abusing them repeatedly over many years while they worked for him as housekeepers.</p><p>Three of the four women worked for the Robinson family in 2015, according to their court papers, but their lawyers, John Harris and Herbert Hayden, said on Friday that none of their clients made the 2015 allegation.

One of those lawyers, Christopher Frost, said on Friday that he and his team were “pleased” that “the L.A. district attorney has confirmed there was no basis to file charges a decade ago.”</p><p>“One unfortunate aspect of celebrity is that it is not uncommon to be the target of spurious and unsubstantiated allegations,” the statement continued.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Department confirmed it had handled a 2015 allegation in the manner described by the district attorney’s office but did not provide additional details.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matt Stevens writes about arts and culture news for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a Times reporter covering California.
