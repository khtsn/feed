    <h1>Former Trump Staff Members Liken His Actions to Those of ‘Royal Despot’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A number of prominent Republicans, including several former members of the first Trump administration, have signed <a href="https://statedemocracydefenders.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/open-letter-opposing-white-house-retaliatory-investigations-041825.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an open letter</a> decrying the president for using his power to punish two former administration officials who criticized him, likening his actions to those of a “royal despot.”</p><p>“For a president to personally and publicly direct the levers of the federal government against publicly named citizens for political reasons sets a new and perilous precedent in our republic,” the group wrote. “No matter one’s party or politics, every American should reject the notion that the awesome power of the presidency can be used to pursue individual vendettas.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-law-firm-krebs.html" title="">issued two executive orders</a> revoking the security clearances of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chris Krebs</a>, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under during Mr. Trump’s first term and rebutted his claims that the 2020 election had been rigged and stolen, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-associated-with-an-egregious-leaker-and-disseminator-of-falsehoods/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miles Taylor,</a> who once served as chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Taylor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html" title="">anonymously wrote</a> a New York Times opinion essay in 2018 accusing Mr. Trump of rampant “amorality” and telling of an internal government “resistance.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s executive orders also revoked the security clearances of people and institutions affiliated with Mr. Krebs and Mr. Taylor, and called for investigations into their government tenures. The letter, signed by more than 200 people, criticized those actions as part of a “profoundly unconstitutional break” with precedent.</p></div></div>
