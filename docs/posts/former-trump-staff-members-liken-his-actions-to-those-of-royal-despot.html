The letter, signed by more than 200 people, criticized those actions as part of a “profoundly unconstitutional break” with precedent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Behavior of this kind is more to be expected from a royal despot than the elected leader of a constitutional republic,” the signers wrote. “This is the path of autocracy, not democracy.”</p><p>The letter’s signatories include Ty Cobb, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/us/politics/ty-cobb-trump-legal-team.html" title="">a lawyer</a> who led Mr. Trump’s response to a special counsel’s investigation of his ties to Russia during its early phases, and John Mitnick, who served as general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/us/politics/john-mitnick-homeland-security.html" title="">until he was fired</a> in 2019 after clashing with the White House.</p><p>Mr. Cobb and Mr. Mitnick, like many of the other Republicans on the list of signatories, have been openly critical of Mr. Trump since parting ways with his administration.</p><p>The letter was spearheaded by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a group run by Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served on the staff of the first team of House Democrats that worked to impeach Mr. Trump in 2019.</p><p>The Brookings Institution is not involved in the fund, nor was it involved in the letter.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Karoun Demirjian is a breaking news reporter for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Housing Aid:</strong> The White House is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/housing-aid-hud-federal-budget.html">deep cuts to federal housing programs</a>, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, in a reconfiguration that could jeopardize millions of Americans’ access to rental assistance funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standoff Over Transgender Athletes:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-sues-maine-trans-athletes-womens-sports.html">sued Maine</a> over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, just days after also threatening to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disinformation Office Shuttered:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio shut down a State Department office that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-rubio-state-department-foreign-disinformation.html">tracks and counters global disinformation</a>, including campaigns by rival powers of the United States and terrorist groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deals With Law Firms:</strong> To avoid retribution, some of the nation’s biggest law firms agreed to deals with President Trump to provide free legal services for uncontroversial causes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">Now he wants more from them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
