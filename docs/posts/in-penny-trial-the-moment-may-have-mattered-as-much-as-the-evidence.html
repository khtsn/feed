That afternoon, Daniel Penny left City Tech in Downtown Brooklyn, where he was studying architecture, and headed into Manhattan via the F train to the Flatiron branch of Life Time, the elite gym and wellness merchant. A few stops in, at Second Avenue, an unhinged Jordan Neely got on and threw his jacket to the floor.</p><p>He started ranting about deprivation — about wanting ginger ale, about not caring if he ended up at Rikers, about feeling ready to die. Whether he mentioned wanting to kill anyone is unclear; witnesses offered differing accounts. But he seemed to be unarmed, directing his tirade at no one in particular.</p><p>Mr. Penny, a former Marine with a green belt from the corps’ martial arts program, looked at the frightened women and children around him and immediately sought to subdue a man they believed to be dangerous, grabbing him from behind and putting him in a chokehold. According to records from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, only 30 seconds passed between the time the train left Second Avenue and when it arrived at the next station.</p><p>At that point, everyone fearing this person who seemed so combustible could get off. Still, Mr. Penny held to the chokehold, exerting varying degrees of pressure, for nearly another five and a half minutes. Mr. Neely was pronounced dead at Lenox Health hospital in Greenwich Village. A medical examiner determined that he had died as a result of compression to the neck.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Monday morning, after just a brief period of deliberation, jurors acquitted Mr. Penny on the charge of criminally negligent homicide. The judge overseeing the case had already dismissed the higher charge of manslaughter in the second degree after jurors said on Friday that they could not unanimously come to an agreement on that count. Ultimately, the verdict — rendered in a case involving a momentary eruption of erratic behavior by an unstable man — suggests the extent to which New Yorkers have lost faith in the prospect of their physical safety.</p><p>In a strikingly convivial conversation with detectives at the Fifth Precinct on the day of the confrontation, Mr. Penny would describe the man he put in his grip as a “crackhead,” claiming that “these” were the “guys” who were “pushing people in front of trains.” However glaring the bias, the assumption was one any of us might have made. All but two of the 11 witnesses who testified at the trial said that Mr. Neely’s presence amounted to the scariest experience they’d had on a subway.</p><p>When it comes to the perception of threat, context is everything. The city emerged from the depths of the pandemic with a rise in subway crime marked by a series of terrifying events that began in January 2022, when Michelle Go, a 40-year-old banker, died after she was shoved into the path of an oncoming train at Times Square <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/nyregion/martial-simon-michelle-go.html" title="">by someone with psychosis</a>. From that moment through mid-October of the following year, 37 people were pushed off subway platforms, episodes that dominated coverage in the tabloids. This is to say nothing about other random acts of violence, however statistically aberrant, and the broader toll on commuters who have watched the city’s mental health crisis play out underground every day.</p><p>Mr. Neely was a 30-year-old Black, homeless Michael Jackson impersonator who had been hearing voices and succumbing to bouts of public rage for about 10 years. His life had begun to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/jordan-neely-death-subway.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seriously derail when he was 14 and his mother was murdered</a> by a jealous and controlling boyfriend. What eventually followed was a debilitating stint at Rikers; a dependency on K2, the synthetic cannabinoid; stays at psychiatric hospitals; and the inevitable severing of social and family ties.</p><p>Had Mr. Neely died during an encounter with a young white Marine several years earlier it would have been easy to imagine a broad movement forged in his name — a coalition of activists and bourgeois liberals like those who protested the murder of George Floyd. In the aftermath of Mr. Floyd’s death, Black Lives Matter posters filled the windows of $10 million brownstones; mothers in expensive clogs convened at Barclays Center in Brooklyn with their billboards and children well-schooled in the history of oppression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Neely case has lacked the same fire; the mood seems to have shifted. Many of those same mothers who faced off against a brigade of cops in riot gear now worry about their children on the subways. Outside the courthouse at 100 Centre Street on Tuesday, the final day of closing arguments, the crowd of protesters was small.</p><p>In the days following Mr. Neely’s death, fliers posted in subway stations called for rallies in front of the courthouse every day of the trial and described Mr. Penny as “a white racist vigilante” who attacked a “performance artist” who was merely “pleading for food.” But that was not the subtext of the prosecution’s case.</p><p>Built in the Manhattan district attorney’s office under the progressive, reform-minded leadership of Alvin Bragg, the case allowed a certain sympathy for the defendant’s predicament, acknowledging that he “started out doing the right thing” and that his effort to step in and help fellow passengers was “laudable.”</p><p>As Dafna Yoran, the lead prosecutor, put it in her closing statements, those passengers were “understandably threatened and scared.” A few days earlier on a talk show, Mayor Eric Adams defended Mr. Penny, maintaining that he was “doing what we should have done as a city.” The issue, by the prosecution’s account, was that Mr. Penny, as an ex-Marine, would have known the difference between a lethal chokehold and one merely intended to restrain. That he kept his grip long past the point at which Mr. Neely was limp and obviously unconscious was what recklessly killed him, prosecutors said.</p><p>A high-profile trial will always draw a crowd of invested spectators. At the front of the public line to get in on Tuesday morning was a white man who described himself as a lifelong New Yorker, who divided his time now between the Upper East Side and Florida. He was, as he put it, “here for Daniel Penny.” Behind him were two Black women, one of them a social worker carrying a canvas bag that read “Close Rikers Now.” Among the political statement buttons running down the center of her sweater was one calling out privatization of the New York City Housing Authority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Waiting for space to open up in the courtroom gallery, the three shared a long and respectful conversation. The women offered an extensive history of police brutality in the city. They handed the man a flier with the faces of more than 50 people who had been killed by the New York Police Department since Amadou Diallo was shot in 1999. He looked it over with great interest and later shared it with another man on the line. But his underlying view was that the city had become chaotic and that the criminal justice system was now too permissive.</p><p>Thirty-eight years ago, in the very same courthouse, Bernard Goetz, a white man nicknamed “the subway vigilante” by the tabloids, was acquitted on all counts of attempted murder after he shot and wounded four young Black men on the subway who he said he thought were going to rob him. A New York Times poll conducted after the shooting showed that a majority of New Yorkers approved of what he did. Two out of five said that muggings had become bad enough that New Yorkers had “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/14/nyregion/poll-indicates-half-of-new-yorkers-see-crime-as-city-s-chief-problem.html" title="">a right to take matters into their own hands.”</a></p><p>The newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin saw things differently. Writing one of many pieces about the case, early in 1985, he speculated as to what might be going on: “He seems to be a hero,” Mr. Breslin wrote, “at a time when the city has none.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 8, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misidentified the lead prosecutor in the Penny trial.
