He would fill a vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.</p><p>The lifetime appointment requires conformation in the Senate, where he is expected to face the unanimous opposition of Democrats.</p><p>“Emil is SMART, TOUGH, and respected by everyone,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform. “He will end the Weaponization of Justice, restore the Rule of Law, and do anything else that is necessary to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Emil Bove will never let you down!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Bove, a graduate of Georgetown’s law school who prosecuted high-profile national security cases during nearly a decade in the Manhattan federal prosecutor’s office, has told friends that his longtime goal had been to serve as a federal judge, according to people in his orbit.</p><p>But should he be confirmed, he would exit one of the most powerful federal law enforcement jobs in the country after only a few months on the job — a period where he has ordered the purge of career officials and emerged as a stoic and unyielding enforcer of the president’s agenda.</p><p>A defining episode of his tenure so far was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/emil-bove-trump-doj.html" title="">the battle he waged against his former colleagues</a> in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York over the administration’s request to drop bribery charges against the New York mayor, Mr. Adams.</p><p>Mr. Bove pressured top prosecutors in the office to drop the case. He claimed that the charges had been brought by an overzealous Biden-appointed U.S. attorney and argued that the case would hinder Mr. Adams’s capacity to cooperate with the White House on immigration enforcement.</p><p>The interim U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle R. Sassoon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/danielle-sassoon-quit-eric-adams.html" title="">resigned rather than sign off</a> on Mr. Bove’s command, saying it was her duty “to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/13/us/doc-annotation-letter-to-bondi.html" title="">in a letter to Mr. Bove</a> explaining her decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Bove, rebuffed by Ms. Sassoon, asked officials in the department’s Washington headquarters to take over the case, then have someone on their staff sign the dismissal.</p><p>Instead, five prosecutors in the criminal division and public integrity unit also quit, leaving their colleagues to furtively discuss their options, expressing their hope that they would not be called upon to take actions that would end with their resignation or termination.</p><p>Mr. Bove was forced to argue for the dismissal himself, appearing alone at the prosecution table at a February hearing in Manhattan federal court.</p><p>There are two vacancies in the Third Circuit — one based in New Jersey and one in Delaware. It is not clear which seat Mr. Bove is nominated for. He has a property in Pennsylvania, and some conservatives have called for moving the Delaware-based seat to Pennsylvania.</p><p>Mr. Bove is currently the top deputy to Todd Blanche, the department’s No. 2 official — reprising a partnership forged in their successful defense of Mr. Trump in his two federal trials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>His deceptively modest title, principal associate deputy attorney general, belies his power in the department. Because his post did not require Senate confirmation, Mr. Bove was among the first Trump appointees to arrive at the department in late January.</p><p>He oversaw a succession of major policy and personnel moves, starting with a memo threatening <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/justice-department-immigration-enforcement.html" title="">to prosecute state and city officials</a> who refused to carry out immigration enforcement, followed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/us/politics/chicago-deportation-emil-bove-trump.html" title="">a visit to Chicago</a> to observe enforcement actions.</p><p>He has continued to play a pivotal role at the department even after Mr. Blanche and Attorney General Pam Bondi arrived weeks later, particularly on immigration, working closely with a top aide to the president, Stephen Miller.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice for The Times and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.</p></div><div><p>Charlie Savage writes about national security and legal policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
