    <h1>Judge Blocks Trump Administration From Dismantling CFPB</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But only Congress can close the bureau, and parts of the agency have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/business/trump-cfpb.html" title="">flicked back to life</a> over the past seven weeks in response to legal challenges. Nearly 200 terminated employees have been rehired, and some of the agency’s departments have returned to work to carry out the bureau’s legally mandated responsibilities. Most of the staff, however, has remained on administrative leave.</p><p>For years, the financial industry has complained that the consumer bureau, which regulates a range of lending activity from mortgages to credit cards, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/business/rohit-chopra-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-wallstreet.html" title="">has been overly aggressive</a>, tying up companies in litigation and red tape and hindering credit from flowing to consumers.</p><p>Judge Jackson wrote that Mr. Vought’s actions “were taken in complete disregard for the decision Congress made 15 years ago” to create the agency and assign it the power to monitor banks and other lenders and enforce consumer protection laws. Without an injunction, she said, the government would likely “complete the destruction of the agency completely in violation of law” and annihilate it so thoroughly that “it will be impossible to rebuild.”</p><p>The judge opened her ruling with three epigraphs quoting senior administration officials — <a href="https://x.com/joeygarrison/status/1889132023933022283?Mx=2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including Mr. Trump himself</a> — openly stating their intention to destroy the bureau. (“That was a very important thing to get rid of,” Mr. Trump said in early February, praising Mr. Vought’s actions.)</p><p>Judge Jackson’s order instructs the government to reinstate and preserve the bureau’s contracts, employees, data and operations while the case progresses.</p></div></div>
