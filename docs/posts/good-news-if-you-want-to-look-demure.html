Flouncy, lacy, columnar dresses instead of skintight styles. More knee-length shorts, fewer micro mini skirts.</p><p>After viewing about 3,000 photos from more than 100 runway shows held during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/style/paris-fashion-week-trends.html" title="">fashion month</a>, a sense of delicate restraint was a discernible thread connecting various looks. Many designers in their spring 2025 collections offered ladylike alternatives to the flashy, logo-heavy and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/20/style/naked-dressing.html" title="">revealing</a> clothing that filled stores and closets in the wake of pandemic lockdowns, as people were retiring sweats for attire that channeled a new liberation from their couches.</p><p>Modesty was detectable in brands’ different takes on floppy bow blouses and nightgown dresses with Victorian flourishes like ruffled collars, as well as in footwear like low-heeled pumps with sensible box toes.</p><p>This was not the lone dominant trend on the runways, which also featured an abundance of bubble pants, flight suits and preppy-style blazers. But it was the only theme that could be tied to a word that has lately gripped popular culture: demure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The term, after being thrust into everyday lexicons through a viral TikTok video from August, came to be seen as an aesthetic counterpoint to the disheveled chaos of this year’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/style/what-is-a-brat-charli-xcx.html" title="">“brat” summer</a>, which was sort of a continuation of the sleazy chaos that defined the look of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/14/style/delta-variant-vaccine-covid-summer.html" title="">“hot vax summer”</a> of 2021.</p><p>Describing the “demure” look, the Styles reporter Callie Holtermann <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/style/demure-tiktok-mindful-cutesy.html" title="">put it this way</a>: “It’s tucking your hair behind your ear. It’s a Peter Pan collar. It’s nibbling on some raspberries!”</p><p>The Prada show in Milan featured two of those criteria: Peter-Pan-collar jackets in supple suedes and models with tousled hair tucked behind their ears. (There were no berries on the runway.) The designers Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons said the brand’s latest collection, which also featured minimal makeup and structured bags, was a commentary on social media algorithms. By incorporating components of the demure formula, they played right into one.</p><p>Though designers had already begun developing their latest lines by the time the chatter about all things demure had hit an inflection point, their collections nevertheless seemed to tap into a larger conversation.</p><p>And the fact that clothing from spring 2025 collections won’t be appearing in stores until early next year suggests that the demure look exemplified by the following six runway trends may have longer legs than other fads.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-5"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left, spring 2025 looks from Bottega Veneta, Jil Sander, Gauntlett Cheng and Alainpaul. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span> Bottega Veneta; Jil Sander; Thierry Chesnot/Getty Images; Firstview</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The 1950s came to mind seeing sweet little cardigan sweaters paired with knee-grazing skirts at shows including Bottega Veneta, Jil Sander and Alainpaul, an up-and-coming label co-founded last year by Alain Paul, a former contemporary dancer who had worked under Demna Gvasalia at Vetements and Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton.</p><h2 id="link-45db6df4">Shrunken Jackets</h2></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left, spring 2025 looks from Prada, Sandy Liang, Coperni and N21.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Prada; Filippo Fior; Luca Tombolini; Paolo Pucci for In Digital Images</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>More formal but no less dainty than cardigans were the boxy little jackets shown by brands like Sandy Liang, Prada, N21 and Coperni, some of which evoked styles worn by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.</p><h2 id="link-2fe2df32">Capelets</h2></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-9"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left, spring 2025 looks from Colleen Allen, Burberry, Comme des Garçons and Giambattista Valli.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Annie Powers, Courtesy of Colleen Allen; Isidore Montag/Gorunway; Daniele Oberrauch/Gorunway; Yannis Vlamos</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Capelets, the prim equivalent of knit ponchos, may be less practical than other outerwear. But they were used plentifully as a finishing touch. Comme des Garçons’s version was a giant pouf, Burberry’s was pleated and seemingly crossbred with a parka, and Colleen Allen’s was elegant: The brand, founded by its eponymous designer six months ago after working at the Row, showed a golden-orange, ruched-velvet capelet meant to be worn slightly askew over the shoulders.</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-13"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left, spring 2025 looks from Simone Rocha, Cecilie Bahnsen, Ganni and Luar.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Ben Broomfield; Thierry Chesnot/Getty Images; Firstview; Monica Feudi</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Organza could be described as chiffon’s uptight sister, a stiffer yet equally sheer material that had its last good run on runways in the ’90s before becoming a preferred textile of prom-dress makers. This season, the use of organza by brands associated with femininity (Simone Rocha, Cecilie Bahnsen), as well as by those considered avant-garde (Luar), brought to mind the material’s last heyday.</p><h2 id="link-56f311fc">Princess Seams</h2></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-15"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left, spring 2025 looks from Gucci, Marni, Valentino and Gabriela Hearst.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Monic; Marni; Thierry Chesnot/Getty Images; Valentino </span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Princess seams run down the front of a bodice or a dress, following the shape of a woman’s body. They were popular elements of debutante gowns in the mid-19th century and, more recently, frocks in the 1950s. Labels that harked back to midcentury femininity with garments incorporating princess seams included Gabriela Hearst, Gucci, Valentino and Marni, which incorporated the seams into full-skirted dresses to achieve a Betty Draper effect.</p><h2 id="link-79293bb7">Bermuda Shorts</h2></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-17"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left, spring 2025 looks from Diotima, Dries Van Noten, S.S.

Most versions fell to the knees, others were even longer and many were styled with matching jackets to create spring-weather suits.</p></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>What to Wear Next: </strong>A brilliant Loewe collection, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/style/loewe-alexander-mcqueen-comme-des-garcons.html">some good ideas</a> from Courrèges and Junya Watanabe, and a step forward at Alexander McQueen.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Actress’s Style: </strong>Issa Rae <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/style/issa-rae-jewelry-braeve.html">prefers attire with “symmetry”</a> and avoids flashy clothes.
