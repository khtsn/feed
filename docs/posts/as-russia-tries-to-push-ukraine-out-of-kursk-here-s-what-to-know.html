The flow of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-us-saudi-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">aid resumed</a> this week as Ukraine agreed to a Trump administration proposal for a 30-day cease-fire with Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>On Thursday, Mr. Putin expressed preliminary support for the proposal but said he still had questions that required more discussion. Those questions, he told a news conference, included the fate of Ukrainian troops still in Kursk — suggesting that he may demand Kyiv order them to lay down their arms.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Here is a look at the Ukrainian incursion — the first on Russian soil since World War II — and how Russian troops are fighting back.</p><h2 id="link-5a5bd9c3">Why is Kursk important?</h2><p>Kursk is an area of western Russia that borders the Sumy region of Ukraine. <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-13-communities-in-sumy-oblast-injuring-1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sumy</a> had long been thought to be a place where Russia might try opening a new front in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022.</p><p>But in a move that surprised even its key allies, Ukrainian troops caught Moscow off guard last summer, pouring across a thinly defended border and opening a new front themselves.</p><p>The main <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-offensive.html" title="">objectives</a>, one Ukrainian colonel told The New York Times, were to divert Russian troops from the grueling fighting in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, push Moscow’s artillery out of range of the Sumy region and damage Russian morale.</p><p>Within weeks of the incursion, Ukraine had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-invasion-map.html" title="">established</a> control over a slice of Kursk that its officials said encompassed nearly 500 square miles of farmland and settlements. Though barely a sliver of Russia, the largest country in the world, the assault was an embarrassment for Mr. Putin. It also surprised Ukraine’s allies, including the United States, who had not been told in advance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The most important town in Kursk that Ukrainian forces seized was Sudzha, an administrative center with a population of around 5,000 people before the incursion.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian military vehicle driving away from the Russia’s Kursk region in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Finbarr O&#39;Reilly for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Analysts said that Ukraine’s offensive was a gamble, stretching its military resources at a time when Kyiv’s troops were struggling to defend a long front line in their own territory.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said that his military did not want to stay on Russian soil indefinitely, and that territory gained in Kursk could be used to strengthen Ukraine’s position in future negotiations with Moscow.</p><h2 id="link-31f0dfd9">How has Russia responded?</h2><p>Initially, rather than diverting large numbers of troops to defend Kursk, Mr. Putin said that eastern Ukraine remained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-kursk.html" title="">Moscow’s main military focus</a>. Russian troops continued their creeping advance within Ukraine, taking the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/europe/ukraine-withdraws-vuhledar.html" title="">town of Vuhledar</a> in October and then pushing farther west.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Weeks into its incursion in Kursk, Ukraine’s push slowed and its troops began gradually to lose ground as Russian forces deployed there in greater numbers.</p><p>Then, in the fall, Russia received a boost from its ally North Korea, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine.html" title="">deployed around 11,000 soldiers</a> to Kursk to assist Moscow’s defense. The deployment at first unnerved Ukraine and its allies. But the North Korean troops suffered wave after wave of heavy losses and, for a time, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/europe/north-korea-troops-ukraine-russia.html" title="">withdrawn from the frontline</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evacuees from border regions, including from Sudzha, waiting for aid in Kursk, Russia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In recent weeks, Russian forces, assisted by North Korean fighters, have advanced rapidly in Kursk, using drones and fighter jets to retake much of the territory that Ukraine had held.</p><p>In a sign of renewed military confidence, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/putin-kursk-ukraine.html" title="">Mr. Putin visited a command post</a> near the front in Kursk late Wednesday, the Kremlin said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, pushed back against the idea of an immediate Ukrainian withdrawal from the area. He said on Wednesday night that Ukrainian troops would “hold the line in the Kursk region for as long as it remains reasonable and necessary.”</p><p>On Thursday, Russia’s Defense Ministry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/russia-sudzha-recapture-kursk-ukraine.html?smid=url-share" title="">claimed that its forces had retaken Sudzha</a>. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. If confirmed, that Russian advance would leave only small pockets of Russian land along the border under Ukrainian control.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Russia’s Push in Kursk and What It Says<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
