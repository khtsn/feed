    <h1>Great Apes and Tiny Bears: Chasing Wild Thrills in Borneo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>We lurched along an unpaved road in the night, walls of trees and knotted vines on either side. In the darkness lurked some of the world’s most unusual mammals, and I had come to Borneo to fulfill a lifelong dream to see them: catlike <a href="https://www.thecivetproject.com/civets" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">civets</a>, scaled anteaters called <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/pangolin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pangolins</a> and big-eyed <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/magazine/issues/fall-2018/articles/flying-lemurs-or-colugos-can-t-technically-fly-and-aren-t-technically-lemurs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">colugos</a> that spread their body flat as they glide from trunk to trunk.</p><p>In the open back of a pickup truck, two wildlife spotters stood in front of me, whirling their flashlights. To my right stood my father, whose lifelong obsession with wildlife had inspired my own. Clothes damp from the humidity, we plunged deeper into the moonlit jungle.</p><p>My father and I had long wanted to travel to Borneo together, inspired by an online community of people called mammal watchers, who shared tantalizing stories about their sightings on the island on the website <a href="https://www.mammalwatching.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mammalwatching.com</a>.</p><p>Mammal watching is superficially similar to bird-watching: trying to see as many different wild species as possible. It is hard — mammals can be elusive — but rewarding, as the most interesting mammals dwell in the earth’s wildest and most vulnerable places. Searching for these creatures is both an adventure and an exercise in supporting conservation, particularly in Borneo, where palm oil plantations have replaced large areas of rainforest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>So much of my interaction with mammal watching had been virtual that, on a warm June night, as we rumbled through the 140,000-acre <a href="https://deramakot.sabah.gov.my/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deramakot Forest Reserve</a> in the Malaysian state of Sabah, I could hardly believe what I was seeing.</p><p>A flashlight caught a gleam on a branch to the left. We trained our flashlights about 50 feet up a fig tree to see a <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/binturong" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">binturong</a>, a blackish gray, shaggy, whiskered creature also known as a bearcat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/00Borneo-bjfz/00Borneo-bjfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/00Borneo-bjfz/00Borneo-bjfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/00Borneo-bjfz/00Borneo-bjfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A sleek brownish-gray creature known as a binturong or bearcat, is perched on a branch, looking down with yellow eyes." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/00Borneo-bjfz/00Borneo-bjfz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/00Borneo-bjfz/00Borneo-bjfz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/00Borneo-bjfz/00Borneo-bjfz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/18/multimedia/00Borneo-bjfz/00Borneo-bjfz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d7cabf1b-4b91-5fed-807d-5f96c973b359" decoding="async" width="600" height="600"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A binturong, or bearcat, at the Deramakot Forest Reserve.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mihir Zaveri</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This was one of the creatures that had been living in my imagination since I was a child, and I felt an electric thrill.</p><h2 id="link-4666ac9f">Drawn to an endangered Eden</h2><p>I don’t remember exactly when I came to love animals. But wildlife is intertwined with some of my earliest memories.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When I was 6, we saw 16 black bears on a family trip to Canada (I kept count). The next year, I spotted a tiger in India. Over the next two decades, my interest deepened during trips to Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Kenya, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania and other countries.</p><p>No place beckoned, though, as much as Borneo, the third-largest island in the world, smaller only than Greenland and New Guinea. Three countries share this Southeast Asian island: Malaysia and tiny Brunei occupy the northern third, and Indonesia controls the rest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A pygmy elephant at the Deramakot reserve.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mihir Zaveri</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The island is home to some of the most iconic, and unusual, mammals on earth, species like <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/orangutan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">orangutans</a>, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/bornean-elephant" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pygmy elephants</a> and proboscis monkeys with their bulbous noses.</p><p>“It had a mystique that was larger than life,” said my father, who read about all these animals when he was a child growing up in India.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Until a few decades ago, Borneo was covered in tropical forests. Then, in the early 1970s and the decades after, many forests were logged and then cleared for palm oil plantations, until more than one-fifth of the total area of Sabah was planted with oil palms, according to a 2022 study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837722003350" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published in the journal</a> Land Use Policy.</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-11"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: A pair of Bornean orangutans, a silvered leaf monkey, two maroon leaf monkeys and a North Bornean gray gibbon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mihir Zaveri</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Bornean wildlife paid the price. The population of Bornean orangutans, found nowhere else in the world, declined by more than 50 percent over the last 60 years, according to the World Wildlife Fund, a conservation nonprofit.</p><p>With a sense of urgency, my father and I planned a trip for last June with the help of Jon Hall, the founder of mammalwatching.com and the de facto leader of the mammal-watching community. We ended up with an itinerary that included <a href="https://deramakot.sabah.gov.my/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deramakot</a>, the majestic <a href="https://sabahtourism.com/destination/kinabatangan-river/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kinabatangan River</a> and some of the oldest rainforests in the world in <a href="https://sabahtourism.com/destination/danum-valley-conservation-area/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Danum Valley</a>.</p><p>An outfit called <a href="https://www.adventurealternativeborneo.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adventure Alternative Borneo</a> offered a relatively affordable price for a mouthwatering 10-day itinerary: $2,950 each, not including airfare. And just like that, we were headed on our dream trip together.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-5c42e183">Serenaded by cicadas</h2><p>The Bornean jungle felt intensely alive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Danum Valley teems with rainforests that are, by some estimates, 130 million years old, some of the most ancient on earth.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mihir Zaveri</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>There was the daily chatter of cicadas, a different buzz going off every few hours; the so-called “6 p.m. cicada” sounded like a saw screeching against metal. Everything was always wet, drenched by daily downpours and humidity so heavy it made gulps of air feel like full glasses of water. Sinuous vines, mosses and fungi — some looking like luminescent teacups, others like miniature red lava lamps — grew anywhere there was space.</p><p>After landing in <a href="https://sabahtourism.com/district/sandakan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sandakan</a>, a city of nearly 200,000 in the island’s northeast, we met our guide, Lister Johns, a native Bornean, who drove us about 20 minutes to a town called <a href="https://sabahtourism.com/destination/sepilok-orangutan-rehabilitation-centre/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sepilok</a>. We stayed at the <a href="https://www.sepilokforestedgeresort.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sepilok Forest Edge Resort</a>, a modest lodge with an open-air cafeteria, a few chalets and a glamping area. Orangutans, gibbons and monkeys were said to cruise through the trees on the property, and the roof to our small room was also home to <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/40792-Cynopterus-sphinx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">short-nosed fruit bats</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-17"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: A small-toothed palm civet; a trefoil horseshoe bat; a type of venomous primate called a slow loris; and a Sunda colugo, which can spread its body flat to glide from tree to tree.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mihir Zaveri</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>At the nearby <a href="https://rainforestdiscoverycentre.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rainforest Discovery Center</a>, a network of suspended walkways brought us into the canopy, where a large orangutan came crashing through branches and leaves and observed us from a treetop. In the evening, <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.org/borneos-gliding-giants/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">red giant flying squirrels</a> emerged from their tree holes before sailing from trunk to trunk in the twilight.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>But we knew Sepilok was just an appetizer compared with our next destination, Deramakot, about 60 miles to the southwest. This was where others posting on the mammal-watching website reported seeing some of the rarest wildlife, including tree-dwelling <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/clouded-leopard" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clouded leopards</a> and diminutive <a href="https://stlzoo.org/animals/mammals/carnivores/malayan-sun-bear" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sun bears</a>, the smallest species of bear in the world.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Rainforest Discovery Center, near Sepilok, Malaysia, allows visitors to follow walkways into the canopy, where they may see animals like orangutans and red giant flying squirrels.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mihir Zaveri</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Sabah Forestry Station in Deramakot offers a few guesthouses with spartan rooms.

Forestry department staff members cooked meals for guests at an indoor dining area a short walk away.

During the day, we spotted <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/red-leaf-monkey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">red leaf monkeys</a>, a family of orangutans and a pygmy elephant. We napped between excursions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>My dad was ecstatic. “The fact that these nocturnal creatures that live high up in the tropical rainforest, it’s possible to actually see them so well — to me that was one of the mind-blowing parts,” he said. “I used to drool over these pictures in the book on wildlife in India.”</p><h2 id="link-71c354fe">A mammal-watching boon</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sunset on the Kinabatangan River.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mihir Zaveri</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>After a few intense days in Deramakot, Mr. Johns drove us a few hours to Sukau, a community on the Kinabatangan River, the longest in Borneo. During the drive, Mr. Johns, a Sabah native, told us that guiding had become an attractive employment option on the island, particularly for people of modest means.</p><p>Shavez Cheema, the founder of the Borneo-based conservation and tourism nonprofit <a href="https://www.1stopborneo.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1StopBorneoWildlife</a>, who was not involved in our trip, said in an interview afterward that the interest in seeing Bornean mammals had been a boon. While many tourism companies are run by people from the West, Mr. Cheema said, the staff and workers are generally local and Indigenous people. He hoped the government would open new conservation areas to accommodate the growing demand to see wildlife.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>Perhaps more than our previous stops, the Kinabatangan River area reflected the growing tourism industry on the island, with several lodges catering to hundreds of visitors. We traded the simple, government-style forest service accommodations for spacious rooms with patios and a dining area enclosed in floor-to-ceiling windows at the <a href="https://www.borneonaturelodge.com.my/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Borneo Nature Lodge</a>, a modest establishment along the river’s edge.

Proboscis monkeys, which are endangered, are known for their bulbous noses, but they also have sinuous limbs and smooth, golden coats that seem as if they have been brushed with a fine comb.</p><h2 id="link-5a8874f5">Treading in ancient wilderness</h2><p>I felt the most intimate connection with Borneo at our last — and wildest — destination, the Danum Valley, which teemed with rainforests that are, by some estimates, 130 million years old, among the most ancient in the world.
