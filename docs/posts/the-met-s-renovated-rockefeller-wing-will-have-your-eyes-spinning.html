Rockefeller wing</a>, and its collection of work from Africa, the Americas and Oceania that opens on Saturday. Go for the pure visual pleasure of the work there — believe me, it’ll have your eyes spinning — and go for the still unfolding histories it tells.</p><p>Every step of the way through the revamped galleries, closed since 2021, is wondrous. Spaces that once felt cramped and crowded have become enveloping vistas that will stop you in your tracks. Objects once confined to boxy wall cases are now free-standing and approachable, to be engaged with, like the living things they were conceived to be, and truly are.</p><p>These 1,726 objects — majestic carved wood figures from Africa; pocket-size mythical beings, cast in gold, from Mexico; a communally painted, Sistine-worthy ceiling of the South Seas from New Guinea — are as beautiful as any art anywhere on this earth, and represent the spiritual, political and emotional lives of people spread over five continents and eight millenniums.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black and white photo of sculptures installed in a white gallery space." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-vpml-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/90d7b172-0f58-5a04-bbcc-f41563fc05e4" decoding="async" width="600" height="451"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Museum of Primitive Art, in a townhouse on West 54th Street in Manhattan, was founded by Nelson A.

Until fairly recently, this art wasn’t here. When, early in the 20th century, the Met was given a substantial collection of pre-Columbian art, it trucked the material across Central Park to the American Museum of Natural History, where, the idea was, it belonged among mineral specimens and dinosaur bones. “Primitive” art was an art of no dates, produced by craftsmen (always men) with no names, in cultures out of touch with any larger world.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Such thinking was still the rule at most art institutions in the 1950s, when Nelson A. Rockefeller, the politician, avid art collector and Met trustee, tried to interest the museum in exhibiting his large collection of pre-Columbian and African material.</p><p>Failing in his persuasion, he opened in 1957 a museum of his own, calling it the Museum of Primitive Art. (The original name, the Museum of Indigenous Art, was rejected for fear people would confuse “Indigenous” with “indigent.”) It occupied a modest-size townhouse on West 54th Street directly behind the Museum of Modern Art, of which Nelson’s mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, was a founder.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 1982, the Met incorporated Nelson Rockefeller’s collection and his son Michael Rockefeller’s art from the Pacific islands and Australia into a wing designed by Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Manning/The New York Times </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>A dozen years later — by which time the holdings included a significant gathering of art from the Pacific islands and Australia assembled by Rockefeller’s son Michael, a budding ethnologist who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/02/rockefeller-son-ruled-dead.html" title="">died</a> in New Guinea in 1961 at age 23 — the Met changed its mind. Under its venturesome director Thomas Hoving, it agreed to acquire the collection and build a 40,000-square-foot addition to house it. And in 1982 the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing opened.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The newly refreshed $70 million version — designed by Kulapat Yantrasast of WHY Architecture, in collaboration with Beyer Blinder Belle and the Met’s design department — stays within the wing’s original footprint, but shifts the ground plan around.</p><p>A problem with the old configuration was that the Wing didn’t feel organically part of the museum. The primary entrance, from the Greek and Roman galleries, brought us into the African portion of the collection but also seemed to lead us past it, as if it were a roadside attraction to whatever lay beyond.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-53289-cover/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-53289-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-53289-cover/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-53289-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/27/140740_1_28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-53289_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Surrounded and embraced by the creative power of Africa in the entry to the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, with clusters of work from many cultures.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>This has wonderfully changed. The main point of entry to the African collection is still from the Greek and Roman galleries, but now when we enter, under a high white ribbed-arch ceiling, we are <em>in</em> Africa, surrounded and embraced by it. In the center is a savanna of wood-carved sculptures, with enfilades of intimate exhibition spaces on either side and, leading off to the left, deep into the wing.</p><p>And the material installed in these spaces is dizzying in its inventive range, letting you know at a glance that there is no single essential “Africa,” but a multitude of individual cultures rooted in the continent that we have bundled, through lack of knowledge and for political convenience, under that name. And even within those individual cultures, the formal and conceptual variety of the art is awesome, as is instantly evident.</p><p>In front of you at the entry is a tall wood-carved male figure, one of the first works acquired by Nelson Rockefeller around 1958. Made by a Dogon artist in an arid, rocky region of Mali between the 14th and 17th centuries, he stands with his long, thin arms raised straight up, heavenward. Commandingly? Beseechingly? A label identifies him as a priest, but we don’t really know. One thing for certain, the impression he makes as a welcoming host to the wing is indelible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Look to his right, and you see a second arresting sight, another male figure, also from Mali, but earlier in date and completely different in style and affect. Molded from terracotta, it’s seated and seems to be curling protectively in on itself, as if attempting to sleep, or meditate or hide. Recent research has led to the speculation that ceramic sculptures in this distinctive style, associated with the archaeological site of Jenne-Jeno, were made by women.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Seated Figure, terracotta, from the Middle Niger civilization (what is now Mali), 13th century. The fluidly modeled figure is in a posture that suggests deep contemplation. The artist is unidentified, but women were likely responsible for figurative works created as part of this tradition.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>And to the left you find the image of yet another Malian, this one wearing a wristwatch and dreamily sniffing a flower. It’s a self-portrait by the great Bamako photographer Seydou Keïta (1921-2001), whose decades of images of his homeland compatriots constitute a kind of ancestral empyrean, a vivid archive of a people, a time and a place. (The self-portrait is part of a large cache of African-made photographs recently gifted to the Met by the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/artur-walther-gift" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">German collector Artur Walther.</a>)</p><p>The reinstallation adheres to a format set in this opening selection: clusters of works from individual cultures anchored by one or more single outstanding pieces. A succession of mini-galleries devoted to Central Africa follows, lined with one masterwork after another. A fan-shape Tsesah crest mask that looks like frozen fire. A palm oil-saturated Fang female reliquary figure is flexed like a wrestler but plump as a baby. (She was once owned by the Parisian painter André Derain, and with her geometrically imagined limbs — all swelling tubes — she could well have provided master-class training for the likes of Matisse and Picasso.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Left, a reliquary guardian figure of the Okak-Fang people (Gabon), 19th to early 20th century, made from wood, metal.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Left, the reliquary sculptural bust known as the Great Bieri, by a Fang-Betsi artist, 19th century, wood, copper alloy, palm oil.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>A 19th-century Kongo power figure identified as Mangaaka, an embodiment of ferocious, eruptive justice, looms in your path.

Carved in what is now Nigeria, and long acknowledged as one of the Met’s marquee masterworks, it’s an image of a revered Benin queen named Idia, and honors her as both a moral exemplum and a brilliant political strategist.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view facing the Benin gallery in the African wing.

The many, varied and fabulous examples of textiles now on view throughout the galleries — an innovation of the rethinking — serve the same purpose.

The Oceania collection, which featured towering wood funerary poles carved by Asmat artists of southwest<span>  </span>New Guinea, was almost entirely contained in what is still the wing’s most dramatic space, a gallery with angled floor-to-ceiling windows looking south onto Central Park.</p><p>Over time, though, this sunlight-flooded location proved threatening to art made, as most Oceanic work is, from light-sensitive materials: wood, fiber, paint. Attempts to apply filters to the windows were only partially successful. So with the redesign, a portion of the most vulnerable Oceanic art has been moved to new quarters in the wing’s interior, and a selection of durable Ancient American objects made of stone, metal and ceramic has been brought out into the light.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-26"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-84808-cover/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-84808-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-84808-cover/28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-84808-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/27/140741_1_28cul-rockefeller-wing-met-84808_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Vista of the Arts of the Ancient Americas, where venerable objects made of stone, metal and ceramic have been brought out into the light from Central Park.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>The Art of the Americas display, with its primary entrance across from the museum’s Modern and Contemporary galleries, begins with some of the oldest objects in the collection.

Another is an extraordinary, fragmented ceramic figure made sometime between 200 B.C. and 400 A.D. in Colombia or Ecuador. It depicts an avidly energetic-looking super-ager — a shaman? — who seems to occupy nonbinary terrain between genders and species.

Commissioned in 1970 by the art historian Douglas Newton, the Met’s first curator of Oceanic art, it was shipped to New York and placed in the Met in 1982.

They were made in response to emergencies, specifically to the deaths — through wars or headhunting raids or sorcery — of community members. Once those deaths had been avenged, the poles were moved to the forest to rot. The nine examples acquired by Michael Rockefeller were new when he got them, made in the 1950s, which qualifies them, like the South Seas ceiling, as modern or contemporary work.</p><p>The organizers of the refreshed Rockefeller galleries — Alisa LaGamma, curator of African art and curator in charge of the Wing; Joanne Pillsbury and Laura Filloy Nadal, curators of the arts of the Ancient Americas; and Maia Nuku, curator for the arts of Oceania — are clearly aware of the cultural pertinence, concrete or symbolic, of the art under their care and make an effort to situate the works, ancient or modern in date, on an art historical continuum coming up to our own time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-45"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A woven body mask by an Asmat artist of  southwest New Guinea, mid-20th century,  used for ritual feasts that celebrate passage of the recently deceased to the ancestral realm.
