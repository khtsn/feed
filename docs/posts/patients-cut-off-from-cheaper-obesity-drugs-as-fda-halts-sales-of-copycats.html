disrupt treatment and raise costs.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration has ordered producers and sellers of the less expensive products to wind down operations in the coming weeks now that it has declared there are no longer shortages of the blockbuster drugs Wegovy and Zepbound.</p><p>Produced through a process of mixing drug ingredients known as compounding, the copycat medications had spawned a booming multi-billion-dollar industry. Patients turned to compounding because their health insurance would not pay for the brand-name drugs and they could buy the compounded versions for less than $200 a month in some cases.</p><p><a href="https://lillydirect.lilly.com/pharmacy/zepbound" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eli Lilly</a> and <a href="https://www.novocare.com/obesity/products/wegovy/get-product.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Novo Nordisk</a> now offer the brand-name drugs for $500 a month in most cases to patients who pay with their own money instead of going through insurance. Until recently, patients sometimes had to pay over $1,300 a month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The F.D.A. ordered compounding for versions of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound to end last month.

The Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the F.D.A., declined to answer questions for this article.</p><p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/health/rfk-jr-ozempic-drugs-fda.html" title="">criticized</a> the weight-loss medications, saying that people would be better off eating healthy food, though he <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-interview-takeaways-measles-food-dyes-weight-loss-drugs/?linkId=794638779" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a> that they were “extraordinary drugs.” He has not weighed in on the cheaper copycats.</p><p>The compounding industry has been waging a public-relations campaign and fighting in court to reverse the orders, but has been unsuccessful so far. Although the market for compounded weight-loss drugs is expected to shrink under federal scrutiny, it’s unlikely to dry up altogether. Some providers plan to keep offering the drugs at dosages that aren’t standard or by mixing in vitamins, moves they hope will allow them to skirt the crackdown.</p><p>“We’re about to see just how creative the compounding industry can get,” said Lindsay Allen, a health economist at Northwestern University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>If these strategies keep compounding going even at a reduced scale, it could siphon billions of dollars of business away from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.

To comply with the F.D.A.’s deadlines, it recently stopped selling versions of Eli Lilly’s product and plans to soon discontinue selling versions of Novo Nordisk’s product.</p><p>“We have a lot of patients very concerned that they’re about to get cut off,” Joseph Navarra, the pharmacist and owner, said.</p><p>In Jefferson Township, N.J., Victoria Weyand, 66, paid $200 a month for compounded drugs for obesity that were produced by her local pharmacy. She is on Medicare, which generally will not pay for Wegovy or Zepbound. The Trump administration recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/health/trump-wegovy-obesity-drugs-medicare.html" title="">rejected a Biden proposal</a> that would have expanded Medicare coverage of those drugs for millions of people.</p><p>Ms. Weyand said she had lost about 25 pounds since starting the drugs last November.

More recently, compounders have stepped in amid shortages of chemotherapy drugs and the antibiotic amoxicillin. They routinely tailor-make medicines for people who have allergies or trouble swallowing.</p><p>“Compounding was never intended to compete with the drugmakers,” said Scott Brunner, the chief executive of a trade group for compounders.</p><p>But the Ozempic era brought compounders more patients, revenue and attention than ever before. The big business emerged in 2022, when the F.D.A. first declared Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly’s drugs in shortage. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/113/statute/STATUTE-127/STATUTE-127-Pg587.pdf#page=7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal law</a> allows compounding when there’s a supply shortage or when a patient’s needs can’t be met by drugs through the usual channels.</p><p>Compounded products are produced differently from the brand-name drugs. Novo Nordisk makes its drug in-house. Eli Lilly has been doing most of its manufacturing itself, though in recent years it has also relied on contractors, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-06/weight-loss-drugs-threatened-by-us-effort-to-contain-china?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including in China</a>.</p><p>American compounders typically buy the drug’s active ingredient as a powder from a supplier, often in China.

Compounders are supposed to source their active ingredient from suppliers that are registered with the agency. The F.D.A. or state pharmacy officials inspect compounding operations.</p><p>Compounders say they follow strict production standards and that their products are safe and effective.
