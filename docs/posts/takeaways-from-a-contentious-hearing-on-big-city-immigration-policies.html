Chicago Mayor Johnson.” “Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Comer.” “As a result, sanctuary cities released criminal illegal aliens back onto the streets, where they often go on to commit more crimes.” “All of the mayors here today are actively working to harm the American people you represent. You all have blood on your hands.” “I think we’ve got a problem here. When we decide that there’s some laws that we will obey and some laws that we won’t.” “The false narrative is that immigrants in general are criminals, or immigrants in general cause all sorts of danger and harm. That is, that is actually what is undermining safety in our communities. If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms, stop cutting Medicaid, stop cutting cancer research, stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our city safe.” “Every violent crime is devastating, but scapegoating entire communities is not only misleading, it is unjust, and it is beneath us. So let me be clear. Chicago’s welcoming city ordinance and our other laws and policies do not lead to more crime.” “Overall, crime was down across New York City last year, and we have now had three straight months of double-digit declines in major crimes. To be clear, the sanctuary-city classification does not mean our city will ever be a safe haven for violent criminals. New York City will always comply with city, state and federal laws as it does now.” “Any actions that amplify fears of deportations make Chicago more dangerous. Those fears cause witnesses and victims to avoid cooperating with police. The cooperation of all people, regardless of their immigration status, is essential to achieving the city’s goals of reducing crime and pursuing justice for victims.” “This federal administration is making hard-working, tax paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives. A city that is scared is not a city that’s safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free.” “The premise of this hearing is false. We have local law enforcement cooperating with the local political leadership, and it’s working. It’s bringing down crime rates. And the proposition that immigrants cause crime is false. And the idea that these are sanctuary cities that need to be punished is simply a war on urban America.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/05sanctuary-cities-takeaways-top/05sanctuary-cities-promo11am-hqmb-superJumbo-v3.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">At a congressional hearing, House Republicans accused the mayors of New York, Denver, Chicago and Boston of providing sanctuary to criminals and not fully cooperating with federal immigration efforts.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-03-05T18:39:39-05:00"><span>March 5, 2025</span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>House Republicans cast the mayors of four major American cities as willful impediments to President Trump’s mass deportation agenda during a tense congressional hearing on Wednesday.

They said their policies did not prevent cooperation with federal agents — but also argued that federal law did not require local officials to enforce national immigration policies.</p><p>Several Republicans suggested that the mayors might be guilty of obstruction of justice and that the attorney general should investigate them. “We’ve got a problem here when we decide there are some laws that we obey and some laws that we won’t,” said Representative Gary Palmer, Republican of Alabama.</p><h2 id="link-5d5f0c3e">Mayors strongly defended their policies and their cities’ public safety records.</h2><p>The mayors seemed prepared for the barrage of hostile questions.

They said their policies engendered trust with people in migrant communities, allowing them to feel comfortable cooperating with the local police.</p><p>“We do not harbor criminals,” Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago said. “We arrest them.”</p><p>At times, the mayors appeared eager to draw a contrast with House Republicans, portraying themselves as protectors of public health, safety and education whose jobs have been made more difficult by Congress and the Trump administration.</p><p>“If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms,” Mayor Michelle Wu of Boston said. “Stop cutting Medicaid.

Stop cutting funds for veterans.”</p><h2 id="link-4458786">The hearing spotlighted the continuing partisan divide over immigration.</h2><p>Everyone in the hearing appeared to agree that unrestrained immigration poses a serious challenge to American cities.</p><p>But Republicans and Democrats repeatedly spoke past each other and used words that revealed a fundamental divide over how they approached the issue — “illegal alien” versus “asylum seeker,” “sanctuary city” versus “welcoming city.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The result, in a congressional committee known for its spectacle and combativeness, were clipped exchanges where the lines of questioning were clearly intended more as performance to prove a political point, than efforts to obtain a deeper understanding of the problem.</p><h2 id="link-514acbd3">Democrats invoked faith and Republicans invoked Trump as their guides on immigration.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Michelle Wu of Boston brought her newborn daughter to the House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Mike Johnston of Denver quoted the Bible on Wednesday to explain why he considers immigration a moral issue.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Democrats have not always seemed comfortable talking about matters of faith.
