They might ease off the mass marches and school strikes that built their platform, while refining new strategies like focusing on state politics, reducing the use of fossil fuels at a local level, and re-energizing the country to elect climate-conscious leaders.</p><p>The youth climate movement, which widely defines itself as people under 35, celebrated the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate law in U.S. history. Among other things, it created a conservation-focused job corps for young people.</p><p>But the movement also ran into real-world obstacles: a pandemic, disagreements over how to address climate change, and simply the passage of time.</p><p>“What always makes this movement so difficult to maintain is that they don’t remain children,” said Viktoria Spaiser, an associate professor in sustainability research at the University of Leeds who has studied the youth climate movement. “They become adults and necessarily move on in different activities, so they can’t maintain the claim that they’re the youth” indefinitely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-1"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/00cli-young-activists-02-zwpt/00cli-young-activists-02-zwpt-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Fernanda Pineda for The New York Times</span></span></p><div><p>“It’s like a weird form of child stardom. I don’t have the bank account of a child star, but I have that whole weird growing up and then asking, what was it all for? Things are getting worse, not better.”</p><p>— Jamie Margolin, 23, co-founder and former executive director of Zero Hour</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The 2018 child activists who were in middle and high school are now in their 20s, moving through college and into their careers. They’re facing the conflict so many generations before them have grappled with: how to balance the scales between hope and despair.</p><p>“Covid was a really dark time and made us all slow down and face things,” said Jamie Margolin, the former executive director of Zero Hour. “I’m trying to fight my own cynicism and find a place to actually do the work because who everyone got to know, me at 17, is not the same person I am now.”</p><p>Ms. Margolin was thrust into the global spotlight at 16, in the wake of a brutal fire season that spewed smog over her hometown of Seattle in 2017, around the time that Mr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ms. Margolin and three friends channeled their pent-up frustration over climate change into a continent-spanning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/opinion/climate-strike.html" title="">youth march</a> in 2018. Soon after, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/world/europe/greta-thunberg-graduates-activism.html" title="">Greta Thunberg</a>, now 21, began school striking in Sweden. That fall, the Sunrise Movement went viral after <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/51-arrested-for-protesting-pelosi-heres-what-they-want/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">occupying Representative Nancy Pelosi’s office</a> and demanding climate legislation. They started attending global climate conferences and it seemed like the adults might be listening.</p></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-6"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/00cli-young-activists-06-zwpt/00cli-young-activists-06-zwpt-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times</span></span></p><div><p>“We’re not just the youth climate movement, but the youth climate justice movement.”</p><p>— Keanu Arpels-Josiah, 19, organizer for Fridays for Future USA</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Aru Shiney-Ajay, now 26 and the executive director of the Sunrise Movement, withdrew from Swarthmore College in 2019 to organize full time. She moved into a Philadelphia house with seven other people and slept on a mattress on the floor.</p><p>But then, the coronavirus pandemic arrived in the United States and the dizzying ramp-up of the youth climate movement seemed to stall.</p><p>Much of the movement went from mass marches to the internet, where even younger members of Gen Z were ready and waiting. From her home in Oakland, Calif., Elise Joshi, now 22, began using her social media prowess to amplify some of her peers’ climate causes. She eventually took over a new nonprofit organization — Gen-Z for Change — that uses online campaigns to fight liquefied natural gas terminals on the Gulf Coast and support union strikes at auto manufacturers in Detroit.</p><p>But as the activists grew up, the tactics that once gave their movement star power — mass protests and school strikes — began to feel stale. Groups started to get more disruptive: members of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/14/arts/design/soup-van-gogh-sunflowers-climate.html" title="">Just Stop Oil began throwing cans of soup</a> on famous paintings; Climate Defiance began <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/07/13/these-activists-want-biden-world-to-squirm-in-their-seats-00106134" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crashing political events</a>. (In September, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/climate/goodall-weather-change" title="">interrupted an interview with Vicki Hollub</a>, an oil company executive, during a New York Times climate conference.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-8"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/00cli-young-activists-05-zwpt/00cli-young-activists-05-zwpt-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></p><div><p>“It’s less about having young people be climate activists and more about having every sector of the economy thinking through how climate relates to them in their workplace and in their community.”</p><p>— Elise Joshi, 22, Gen-Z for Change</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>They were disenchanted by the United Nations Climate Change Conference, this year held in Baku, Azerbaijan, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/climate/cop29-un-climate-negotiations.html" title="">hopes were dashed for more than $1 trillion in climate financing</a> to materialize for developing nations. Five years after she sailed across the Atlantic to attend climate talks in Madrid, Greta Thunberg boycotted COP29, as this year’s conference was called.</p><p>Zero Hour sent Jamie Minden, the group’s senior director of global organizing, who at 13 was lying in her bed staring at the ceiling when she decided to devote her young life to fighting the climate crisis. But almost a decade later, Ms. Minden, now 21, knew to brace herself.</p><p>COP29 was a disappointment, she said, if not a death sentence for poor nations.</p><p>And in the U.S., things were not going quite as well under a Democratic administration as they’d hoped: President Biden has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/climate/biden-vs-trump-on-climate-policy.html" title="">permitted major fossil fuel projects</a> and the U.S. is now the world’s top oil producer; global <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/climate/fossil-fuel-emissions-2024-record.html" title="">carbon emissions are on track to hit historic levels</a> in 2024.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On the day Mr. Biden dropped his re-election bid, Gen-Z for Change quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him, as did Climate Defiance. Sunrise Movement has only endorsed one presidential candidate — Senator Bernie Sanders in 2020 — but helped call four million voters on behalf of Ms. Harris. Zero Hour did not endorse a candidate because of the group’s opposition to the war in Gaza. Some of the nine youth climate activists who spoke to The Times said they voted for Jill Stein, the third-party candidate, in protest.</p><p>But now they again have a clearer adversary in Mr. Trump. The stakes are high: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/2024-temperatures-hottest-year.html" title="">2024 will again be the hottest year on record</a>, and scientists warn that the world is well on its way to locking in 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above preindustrial levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-13"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/00cli-young-activists-04-zwpt/00cli-young-activists-04-zwpt-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Diana Cervantes for The New York Times</span></span></p><div><p>“I shouldn’t have to worry about whether my family in North Carolina, that’s supposed to be a climate haven, is going to be dead from a huge hurricane; or if there’s a disease outbreak in the future; or how to factor in climate risk when I’m applying to college.”</p><p>— Lena Goings, 16, member of Fridays for Future NYC</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax, promised to again withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and he’s working to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/climate/trump-cabinet-stefanik-zeldin-wright.html" title="">appoint key federal leaders</a> that support an expansion in oil and gas drilling and overturning environmental rules. Project 2025, which Mr. Trump has not endorsed but could serve as a blueprint for his administration, has proposed eliminating environmental justice offices.</p><p>Leah Thomas, 29, made a social media post in 2020 that popularized the term “intersectional environmentalist.” Her platform was based on links between racial and environmental justice, looking at “the ways in which injustices happening to marginalized communities and the earth are interconnected.” She worried that disagreements over politics, especially over the war in Gaza and how to address fossil fuels that are warming the planet, had splintered the movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Mr. Trump could again be a unifying force as activists refocus their movement at the local and state level. On Tuesday, members of climate groups, including Fridays for Future, held a rally and then occupied a room in the New York State Capitol building to push Governor Kathy Hochul to sign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/nyregion/hochul-trump-new-york-climate.html" title="">the Climate Change Superfund Act</a>. The proposal, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/climate/vermont-law-fossil-fuel-climate-damage.html" title="">like one passed this summer in Vermont</a>, would require polluters like oil and gas companies to pay billions per year that would be used to cope with damage from extreme weather events.</p><p>Whatever the next round of youth climate activism looks like, youth activists overwhelmingly agree that it will be about more than just climate.</p><p>“We’re not just the youth climate movement, but the youth climate justice movement,” said Keanu Arpels-Josiah, a 19-year-old core organizer for Fridays for Future USA. “That reframing is really key.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-18"></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 10, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the location of climate negotiations that Greta Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic to attend in 2019.
