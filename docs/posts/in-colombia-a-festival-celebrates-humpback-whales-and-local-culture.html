Aside from the photographer and me, the only other attendees were members of a large contingent of volunteer physicians and veterinarians who had come to aid the town’s residents. Bandaged-up cats and dogs wandered all around.</p><p>Elders came one by one to a microphone to share stories about the whales.</p><p>Amable Rivas, a fisherman and nature guide, recalled how in the days before motorboats became commonplace, humpbacks played alongside the sailing vessels that ferried passengers to and from Buenaventura. People marked the seasons by the arrival and departure of the whales. They fashioned chairs out of giant whale vertebrae that washed up on the beach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Then, in the 1990s, Mr. Rivas said, fishermen began to notice yachts full of people who had come from elsewhere to see the humpbacks. Before that, it had not occurred to him that whales could be an attraction. “I was scared of them,” he said, thanks to stories he’d heard about a whale “having swallowed a certain Jonas,” the prophet in the biblical tale. Now, he said, he saw the whales as “a gift.” Sometimes, when he was out on the water, he would hear them singing and sing back.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Duván Santiesteban, part of the Horcones del Pacífico group, drumming during the festival in La Barra on June 22.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alba Andrea Angulo, a member of Horcones del Pacífico, singing on the festival’s opening night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Once the elders had spoken, a group of young women took turns reciting poems, including a ballad about a “fat fat fat fish.” A marimba band set up, and children performed whale-inspired folk dances boldly and expertly. Cups of viche, a sharp-edged homemade sugar cane liquor, began to make the rounds.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/festivalballenasycantaoras/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Festival Mundial Ballenas y Cantaoras</a>, a regional-government-supported event now in its seventh year, consists of two parts — this event in late June to welcome the whales, and one from Sept. 20 through 22 to send them off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In September, the crowds would be bigger, with members of Wounaan (pronounced Woo-NAHN) Indigenous communities from the interior joining the Afro-Colombian residents of the beach towns, and musical acts from across the region would perform — not on the bare ground, as now, but on a stage that La Barra’s residents would soon begin building.</p><p>The festivities were already off to a good start. As the night wore on, the marimba and drumming got louder, and the viche flowed. As the residents of La Barra celebrated the whales, they were also celebrating themselves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-22fb0494">Rediscovering the ‘fat fat fat fish’</h2><p>The area around Málaga Bay, <a href="https://old.parquesnacionales.gov.co/portal/en/ecotourism/pacific-region/uramba-bahia-malaga-national-natural-park/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part of a roughly 116,000-acre national marine park</a>, is an important birthing site for humpbacks.

Visitors also come to kayak, surf and tour the vast network of mangrove canals just inland from the beaches. The ferries from Buenaventura land in a town called Juanchaco. From there, the villages of Ladrilleros and La Barra can be reached in an hour or so by foot, or faster by motorcycle taxi.</p><p>Lodgings in Ladrilleros range from bamboo cabins to small, comfortable resorts with pools. La Barra, where the whale festival is being held this year, has mostly mom-and-pop restaurants, surfboard rental shacks and wood-plank hostels like Casa Majagua, where private rooms start at 40,000 Colombian pesos, or about $10, a night.</p><p>The morning after the festival’s opening, while most of La Barra slept, I walked north on the wide gray-sand beach from Casa Majagua toward the mouth of the San Juan River, whose sprawling network of tributaries connects the beach communities to the interior. The tattered cloth sign of Hola-Ola, a place I’d heard described as La Barra’s best restaurant, blew in the wind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Odalia Rivas, the owner of Hola-Ola, a restaurant in La Barra.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-23"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Coconut rice with pianguas, one dish at Ms. Rivas’s restaurant.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of Hola-Ola’s signature dishes, crab in coconut sauce.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The chief cook and proprietor, Odalia Rivas, known as Ola, was already at work. Whale season was a time of abundance for seafood, she said. That included the blue crabs in her signature dish: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3my6Z2C4KI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encocado de cangrejo</a>. Ms. Rivas sautés the crabs in coconut milk, onion, tomato and herbs, wraps them in banana leaves, and serves them with a rock for smashing their shells. Several of her other best dishes star <a href="https://vozdeguanacaste.com/en/piangua-a-mangrove-swamp-delight/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">piangua</a>, a black-fleshed mollusk harvested in the mangroves; it has a texture that is reminiscent of conch.</p><p>Many local women, including Ola’s daughter Sari Rentería, go out every day into the mangroves at low tide and harvest pianguas. “You feel united with the earth,” Ms. Rentería told me later that morning, with her long forearms buried in the mud.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sari Rentería gathering pianguas, a local delicacy, in the mangroves.

Her uncle Mr. Rivas, the fisherman who had spoken the night before, already offered boat tours to discover the area’s many hidden waterfalls and natural pools. Ms. Rentería brings visitors out to dig for pianguas that they can cook together.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Santiago Ortiz, an elected official from La Barra, had accompanied us into the mangroves. Mr. Ortiz, like Mr. Bueno, was big on oralidad, or oral traditions. It’s in situations like this, he said — women out harvesting pianguas, for example — that such traditions are sustained. “It’s not your grandfather sitting down with you and telling you a story,” he explained. “It’s your grandfather telling you a story while you’re doing something like fishing.”</p><p>Mr. Ortiz is an unlikely politician: a 19-year-old biology student in the city of Cali who can get to La Barra only on weekends and holidays. He hopes to promote a limited form of tourism in the town, one stressing nature and culture. Hosting the whale festival helped. “I think this is the right moment,” he said, “to present ourselves to the world.”</p><h2 id="link-e5fd7dd">‘The spirit of the whale’</h2><p>Part of Mr. Bueno’s vision for the whale festival was to create a shared cultural space for Afro-Colombians and Wounaan, who came together mainly through trade. When I asked Ms. Rivas, the chef, about what recipes were common among the Wounaan, she had no idea. “We live pretty separate,” she explained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jooin Jeb, a Wounaan village of about 130 people, sits on a tributary of the San Juan River.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Though no Wounaan had come to the festival’s opening night, some planned to present songs, crafts and stories in September. For that reason, residents of one Wounaan community called Jooin Jeb (HO-een HEB), had invited Mr. Bueno’s team to their home, on a tributary of the San Juan River.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>In the early morning, amid an incessant light rain, the photographer and I set off with Mr. Bueno and his festival delegation from Ladrilleros on boats piloted by Wounaan captains through the thickest, oldest mangroves I had ever seen, toward Jooin Jeb. After two hours, the dark webs of mangroves gave way to the sight of lacy açai palms. A toucan flew low across the river. We docked at earthen stairs carved into the steep riverbank.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of Jooin Jeb wore skin designs of blue-black ink made from jagua fruit for the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, a day they celebrate with a harvest festival.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Jooin Jeb’s 130-some residents all speak the Wounaan language, Woun Meu, along with Spanish. Many Wounaan women are master weavers, using fine palm fibers and natural dyes to create elegant, shiny, stiff-walled baskets. Today was an important holiday for the community, a harvest festival, and many of the young adults who work or study elsewhere had returned. Everyone, from babies to elders, wore freshly painted skin designs of blue-black ink made from <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/jagua-tattoo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jagua fruit</a>.</p><p>Otoniel Chamarra, 39, had his upper body painted in a double zigzag pattern whose four lines crossed at the heart. The design was meant to represent roads, he said, because he was contemplating which road to take with his studies and his life. Mr. Chamarra was working on a degree in business administration in Cali, and also served as Jooin Jeb’s cultural director. In September, he would speak in La Barra about Wounaan perspectives on ecology and, of course, whales.</p><p>For most of their history the Wounaan had been mariners, inhabiting beaches like La Barra’s, Mr. Chamarra said. Though in recent centuries they lived deeper inland, “we have always been in both the river and in the sea,” he said. “The whale protects those lost at sea, and it transmits the energy that has everything to do with our harvest.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-39"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cecilia García playing a drum during a community celebration in Jooin Jeb.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many Wounaan women are master weavers, creating elegant baskets using palm fibers and natural dyes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaír Coll for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>It is in the month of June, when the humpbacks are on their way to Málaga Bay, Mr. Chamarra said, that the Wounaan prepare for this feast, gathering all the families for a prosperous year ahead. “The spirit of the whale,” he said, “is the soul of the products we harvest.”</p><p>After sharing with our hosts a generous lunch of steamed river fish and fresh açai juice, we said farewell to Jooin Jeb. Iridescent blue butterflies floated all around our boats on our journey through forest and mangroves. The great river widened as we approached the sea, drawn, like so many others, toward the whales.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
