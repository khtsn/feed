Trump at the 79th Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner on Thursday, and like Ms. Dowd was increasingly appalled by what I heard. It was all but impossible to keep track of the fellow Americans who were criticized not for their political opinions but assaulted personally in coarse and vulgar language.</p><p>While I don’t remember all the victims, I do recall President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris (said to have the “mental faculties of a child”), Senator Chuck Schumer (with a vague sexual slur), Gov. Tim Walz (likewise), former Mayor Bill de Blasio, Democrats in general and, of course, immigrants.</p><p>One felt sympathy for Cardinal Timothy Dolan as the evening’s host, who had to listen to all this, and the frequently applauding diners who seemed not to realize that the noble tradition of a charity dinner in memory of a great American was being besmirched by being turned into a coarse and vulgar campaign speech.</p><p>Mr. Trump purported to find it “disrespectful” that Ms. Harris was not present (who would want to speak in his company?), but throughout showed no respect for the standards — and faith — of the great Al Smith.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Leo J. O’Donovan</p><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>Thanks to Maureen Dowd for expressing what many Catholics felt upon seeing Cardinal Timothy Dolan laughing jovially at Donald Trump’s cruel personal attacks as well as lies during the annual Al Smith dinner.</p><p>As a Catholic from St. Louis, where Cardinal Dolan grew up, I was ashamed and embarrassed at his seeming tolerance for such a person who in every public utterance continues to vilify people who in our faith are considered children of God.</p><p>If only the cardinal had stood up and sternly rebuked the former president, many of us would have cheered.</p><p>Marian O’Shea Wernicke</p><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/elections/donald-trump-al-smith-dinner-new-york.html" title="">Bitter, Sour and Salty on Menu as Trump’s Fans and Foes Meet</a>,” by Shawn McCreesh (Campaign Notebook, front page, Oct. 19):</p><p>I hope to never again see Donald Trump at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. Mr. McCreesh writes that “the Catholic charity event had become savage, warped by blunt force politics.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Tasteless and spiteful, the speakers at the nationally televised dinner are an embarrassment to the cardinal and to the whole Catholic Church. Isn’t there a better way, more civil and less hurtful, to support Catholic charities? In fact, in our current culture, it might be time for the whole dinner to take a long break.</p><p>(Rev.) Thomas Eichenberger</p><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>I was appalled by the behavior of Cardinal Timothy Dolan at the Al Smith dinner. This dinner is an event to remember the fine life of the Catholic politician Alfred Smith, to “roast” candidates for elected office from both major political parties and to raise money for Catholic charities. It is <em>not</em> a venue for abusive, denigrating, vulgar and blasphemous behavior.</p><p>Every Catholic, indeed every Christian, in New York should expect an apology from the cardinal for not calling out this egregious behavior, for not requiring the kind of decent behavior that this event is celebrating and for which the cardinal supposedly stands.</p><p>Katherine Marschall</p><h2 id="link-39005f48">The Need to Vote</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Early voting in Decatur, Ga.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>Some voters are deciding to “take a stand” by not voting in the 2024 election. They don’t want Donald Trump, but they find Kamala Harris a little less than perfect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The world is an imperfect place. Choices still need to be made. Allowing decisions to fall to others is not taking a stand, nor is it an expression of power; it’s simply shirking responsibility.</p><p>Cast a vote for reality.

She is wrong, however, in her analysis and proposed solution.</p><p>The downward trend did not begin “about a decade ago.” It <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/02/01/need-to-know-about-standardized-testing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">began with No Child Left Behind in 2002</a>, which in many school districts made standardized tests the sole measure of students’ and teachers’ performance and reduced teaching to test prep, nonstop drilling in reading and math skills.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Subjects and activities that might trigger students’ interest — novels, history, science experiments, music, civics — are often neglected. Students are numb with boredom, ground down by a system of “drill, kill, bubble fill.”</p><p>Ms. Grose mentions chronic absenteeism (not only students’ but teachers’) and the shortage of substitutes and new teachers. What we’re seeing is a paralyzing demoralization.</p><p>But you can’t remedy disengagement by “more federal enforcement of state accountability for student outcomes.” You address it by finding ways of engaging students, which means smaller classes where teachers can relate to students as human beings rather than as test scores or data points.</p><p>You attract high-quality teachers by improving teaching conditions, and by releasing everyone from the soul-killing drudgery of a toxic test-and-assess regime.</p><p>Gayle Greene</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p><h2 id="link-67197912">Leave Dead Trees Standing</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Corey Snyder, a wood turner in Pennsylvania, cut sections of a felled sugar maple.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kristian Thacker for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/climate/sugar-maple-tree-pennsylvania.html" title="">Seeing New Beauty in a Beloved Maple’s Demise</a>” (front page, Oct. 17):</p><p>I appreciated the heartfelt piece on the death of an old friend: a venerable sugar maple.</p><p>And I was glad to read about keeping the stump for the animals, but as many environmentalists know, it would have been better to allow for something larger. Leaving dead trees as tall as possible, as long as they don’t pose any danger to anything in the area (for example, by falling on a house) would have been even better. These trees are known as snags.</p><p>An 8- to 10-foot-tall dead tree can have greater value as a habitat for wildlife than a humble stump. Snags can be nature’s apartment complexes, supermarkets and home-improvement stores for countless organisms.</p><p>Ken Druse</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Roberson/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>Re “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5856506/2024/10/20/juan-soto-new-york-yankees-world-series-mlb/?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Soto Stalked His Prey, and Lifted the Yankees to the World Series</a>” (Sports, Oct. 21):</p><p>With a swing of the bat, the New York Yankees outfielder Juan Soto has propelled the Yankees into their first World Series since 2009.</p><p>Soto is a free agent after this season ends.
