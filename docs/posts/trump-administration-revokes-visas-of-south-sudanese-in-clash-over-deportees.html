    <h1>Trump Administration Revokes Visas of South Sudanese in Clash Over Deportees</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the potential deportees have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, and several judges have issued temporary restraining orders as a result.</p><p>Officials in South Sudan could not immediately be reached for comment late Saturday.</p><p>Lucas Guttentag, a former Justice Department official during the Biden administration, called the move “another example of damning individuals based on nationality and upending the lives of innocent and law abiding visa holders instead of engaging in meaningful diplomacy.”</p><p>The Trump administration has attempted to conduct a mass deportation campaign through major operations across the United States in the last few months. Mr. Rubio has argued that he had the right to revoke the visas of some of those potential deportees, now in detention centers, because they were subverting American foreign policy.</p><p>Several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/ice-tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk.html" title="">prominent detainees</a> took part in campus protests or wrote essays against Israel’s war in Gaza and American weapons support for it.</p><p>Mr. Rubio said on March 27 that he had revoked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/rubio-immigration-students-ozturk-chung-khalil.html" title="">perhaps 300 or more visas</a> and was signing papers daily to deport more people. The most prominent foreign citizen to have had his visa revoked was perhaps Óscar Arias Sánchez, the former president of Costa Rica and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Arias <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/oscar-arias-sanchez-visa-trump.html" title="">said</a> on Tuesday that the U.S. government had informed him that the visa in his passport had been suspended, weeks after he wrote on social media that Mr. Trump was behaving as if he were “a Roman emperor.”</p></div></div>
