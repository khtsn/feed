He then contacted and offered to “pay them for some fun,” the authorities added, and sent pornographic videos or images in some cases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The same day, he began contacting a fourth victim after she committed to attending the college, according to prosecutors.</p><p>One of the victims, a 17-year-old, toured the college with Mr. Henriques on April 25, prosecutors said. Mr. Henriques asked her what grade she was in, and hours after the tour, he began texting the victim on the phone number on her admissions form, prosecutors said. He offered to pay her $400 for “some fun” and told her that he had pornographic videos and pictures for her, prosecutors said. He continued to contact her that night, refusing to tell her his identity or how he had her number, they added.</p><p>Mr. Henriques then sent the prospective student five pornographic videos and asked whether she wanted to engage in sexual acts with him, prosecutors said. After her multiple refusals, Mr. Henriques continued to text her, saying “he would buy her anything she wanted” if she changed her mind, prosecutors said. Over the following days, he went into her admissions profile nearly 50 times, according to the Justice Department.</p><p>Mr. Henriques contacted the student through email after she blocked his number, prosecutors said.</p><p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250123052420/https://www.emmanuel.edu/admissions-aid/undergraduate/undergraduate-admissions/contact-us/admissions-counselors/jacob-henriques" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">profile of Mr. Henriques</a> that had been on Emmanuel College’s website said that he graduated in 2021 and was an “avid Boston sports fan,” and that his favorite thing about the college was its small classes, which allowed students “to connect with peers and faculty.”</p><p>If Mr. Henriques is convicted, he could receive from 10 years to life in prison, the Justice Department said. He is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Boston on Monday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Livia Albeck-Ripka is a Times reporter based in Los Angeles, covering breaking news, California and other subjects.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
