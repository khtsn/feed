Wiley, saying: “At this time, we are unable to come to a unanimous vote on count one, manslaughter in the second degree.”</p><p>Justice Wiley responded by reading the jury a so-called Allen charge, official instructions for the jurors to resume their deliberations, with the goal of reaching an agreement through the reconsideration of differing opinions.</p><p>“It’s not uncommon for juries to believe they will never be able to reach a unanimous decision,” he said, adding: “I’ll ask you to continue deliberations on that count.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Justice Wiley said he had to decide if a unanimous agreement was impossible on the manslaughter charge before considering if the jury could move onto deliberating the second charge against Mr. Penny: criminally negligent homicide.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>For some New Yorkers, Mr. Neely’s killing showed the city’s inability or unwillingness to help its most vulnerable and marginalized residents.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Prosecutors said Mr. Penny fatally choked the subway passenger, Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old former Michael Jackson impersonator who struggled with his mental health, when he held Mr. Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes on the floor of an F train on May 1, 2023.</p><p>Mr. Neely had boarded the train that day and begun yelling at passengers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/nyregion/daniel-penny-trial-subway-chokehold-case.html" title="">according to witnesses</a>. As he strode through the subway car, he shouted about being hungry, saying that he wanted to return to jail and that he did not care if he lived or died, they said. Mr. Penny then approached Mr. Neely from behind and put him in a chokehold, taking him to the floor.</p><p>Prosecutors said that Mr. Penny’s actions were not accidental and that he had failed to recognize Mr. Neely’s humanity, squeezing his neck ever tighter as he struggled to break free. They argued that Mr. Penny’s chokehold had killed Mr. Neely, pointing to the testimony of a New York City medical examiner, who ruled that Mr. Neely’s death was caused by “compression of the neck.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Penny’s lawyers argued that their client’s actions had not been the direct cause of Mr. Neely’s death, instead suggesting that it was a toxic combination of Mr. Neely’s synthetic marijuana use, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/nyregion/daniel-penny-defense-jordan-neely.html" title="">sickle cell trait</a> and mental illness that had killed him.</p><p>In instructions the jurors were given before they began deliberations, they were told that they had to first consider the charge of manslaughter and come to an agreement. If they believed that Mr. Penny, a 26-year-old former Marine, was guilty, they would not need to consider the second charge.</p><p>It was unclear, however, if jurors would be able to consider the second charge if they failed to reach an agreement on the first, and they were asking for instructions on Friday about what to do.</p><p>Upon receiving the jury’s note on Friday, Mr. Penny’s lawyer, Thomas A. Kenniff, argued that it would be “coercive” to ask the jurors to continue to deliberate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The defense position at this time is we are moving for mistrial,” Mr. Kenniff said. “The jury has been deliberating for roughly 20 hours, over four days, on what is in many ways a factually uncomplicated case.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prosecutors, including Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran, said that Mr. Penny’s actions were not accidental and that he had failed to recognize Mr. Neely’s humanity. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Dafna Yoran, an assistant district attorney, pushed back, calling it “crazy” to have a hung jury simply because jurors aren’t able to consider a second count.</p><p>“Jury deliberations are not intended to be easy, they’re difficult in every single case no matter how strong the evidence,” Justice Wiley told the jurors before sending them back out of the courtroom.</p><p>Anna Cominsky, director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at New York Law School, said it was not surprising that the jurors were having difficulty reaching a unanimous decision. Not only has the case been “divisive” from the very beginning, she said, but the charges Mr. Penny faces are complicated.</p><p>“Unlike an intentional crime, where the jury is going to look at it and say, ‘This person intended to do this or didn’t,’ with this standard, it’s harder because neither side is saying there was an intention for a death to occur,” Ms. Cominsky said. “However, a death did occur and the question is: Should Penny have changed his action?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In addition, giving the jury an Allen charge on a Friday afternoon “is a tricky position for a case to be in,” Ms. Cominsky said.</p><p>The goal is to have juries who reach a verdict because they unanimously agree on the law, she said. “What we don’t want is them changing their mind because of pressure” or a desire not to return after the weekend, Ms. Cominsky added.</p><p>After the jury left the courtroom, Justice Wiley told the parties that he was still trying to find the relevant case law to help him in making a decision about whether the jurors can deliberate on the second charge if they failed to reach an agreement on the first.</p><p>The jurors have sent roughly 10 notes to Justice Wiley asking for readings of the relevant law, to see video and to have testimony read to them. On Wednesday, for example, jurors asked to hear earlier testimony from Dr. Cynthia Harris, a New York City medical examiner, in which they remembered her saying, “I don’t need all the facts.” She never actually said that, according to court transcripts, but the jurors’ question provided a small window into the elements of the case they were focusing on and had possibly come to an impasse over.</p><p>Soon after the jurors were sent back to continue deliberating on Friday, they sent Justice Wiley another note, this one asking for “further clarification in the determination of whether a person reasonably believes physical force to be necessary.”</p><p>As the jurors exited the courtroom for the second time on Friday, Mr. Penny, seated at the defense table, nodded at several of them while they stared straight ahead.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
