The death toll there is expected to rise, with many injured arriving at hospitals in the country’s second-largest city, Mandalay.</p><p>The earthquake collapsed a skyscraper under construction in Bangkok, killing at least three people and leaving dozens missing.

Approximately 12 minutes later, an aftershock with a magnitude of 6.4 hit the same area.</p><p>An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 is considered major.

The country lies on the eastern end of the Alpide Belt, one world’s most active zones of seismic activity. Three quakes of magnitude 7.7 or greater have struck in or near Myanmar in the last century, according to a U.S.G.S. database, with the most recent in 1988.</p><p>The earthquake on Friday struck at a relatively shallow depth of six miles, meaning it was likely to cause more violent shaking. That shaking was felt as far away as Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, more than 800 miles away from the epicenter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="28wea-quake-embed-map-myanmar-nytcjd6x" data-id="100000010078173" data-source-id="100000010078173"><div slug="28wea-quake-embed-map-myanmar-nytcjd6x" data-sourceid="100000010078173" id="embed-id-100000010078173">

At least 70 people were still missing, while it was unclear whether another 20 people who trapped in an elevator shaft were still alive.
