The epicenter of the quake occurred in central Myanmar, outside Mandalay, a city with an <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/myanmar/mandalay" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated population</a> of 1.5 million people.</p><p>Neighboring Thailand also felt the might of the earthquake, particularly in Bangkok, where <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/thailand/#people-and-society" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around 11 million people</a> live in the metropolitan area.
