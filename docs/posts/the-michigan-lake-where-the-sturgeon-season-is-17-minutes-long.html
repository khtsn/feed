Several thousand fishermen and friends travel from around the country to stay for a long weekend, which gives the area an economic boost.</p><p>“To be honest, it’s bigger than July 4 weekend,” said Jeremy Pasella, an owner of the 211 Bar &amp; Grill in Onaway, a town of about 1,000 known as the <a href="https://www.michigan.org/city/onaway" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sturgeon Capital of Michigan</a>. On the wall is a stuffed sturgeon and photos dating back decades. The season “is worth two weeks of business in the winter.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrew LaLonde serves on the board of the Black Lake chapter of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, which hosts the annual Shivaree festival and seeks to preserve the local sturgeon population.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andy LaLonde</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. LaLonde’s ice shanty.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Last year, the season was canceled because of a lack of ice on the lake, so larger crowds arrived this year.
