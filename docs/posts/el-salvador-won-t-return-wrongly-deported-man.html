    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In an Oval Office meeting today with President Trump, El Salvador’s leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/trump-bukele-prison-deported-migrants.html" title="">said that he would not return a man who was wrongly deported from the U.S.</a> and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador. </p><p>“Of course I’m not going to do it,” the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, said. He compared returning the migrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to smuggling “a terrorist into the United States.” Trump smiled in approval.</p><p>Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father of three, came to the U.S. illegally in 2011, and gained protected legal status in 2019. Until last month, he lived in Maryland with his wife and children, who are all U.S. citizens, and he has never been charged with a crime. Trump administration officials acknowledged that his deportation was an “administrative error.”</p><p>While the Supreme Court last week ordered the government to “facilitate” his return, Trump’s aides have insisted that the courts lack the authority to make such calls. Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland, said he would travel to El Salvador this week if Abrego Garcia was not returned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3471a97d">Harvard rejected Trump’s demands</h2><p>Harvard University said today that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">would not comply with the policy changes requested by the Trump administration</a>, setting up a showdown between the government and the nation’s wealthiest university.</p><p>The Trump administration, which had said that it was reviewing $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard, had laid out several demands <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/14/us/trump-harvard-demands.html" title="">in a letter</a>: The school must reduce the power of students and faculty over the university’s affairs, report foreign students who commit conduct violations to the federal authorities and bring in an outside party to ensure that the school is “viewpoint-diverse,” among other actions. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-response.html" title="">Read Harvard’s response</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Zuckerberg in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-d34daf3">Zuckerberg took the stand in the Meta antitrust trial</h2><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, took the witness stand today to defend his company on the opening day of a landmark antitrust trial. The Federal Trade Commission began the day by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-ftc.html" title="">accusing Meta of creating a monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp</a> to squelch competition. If successful, the F.T.C. is expected to seek to break up the company.</p><p>Zuckerberg responded by describing the social media market as much larger than how the government was defining it. He said that while social media was a core focus of Meta, the company was also involved in “the general idea of entertainment and learning about the world and discovering what’s going on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A ChatGPT workshop for teachers in Walla Walla, Wash.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ricardo Nagaoka for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-52e22d04">Teachers worry about A.I. for students, but love it themselves</h2><p>As artificial intelligence has made its way into schools, many teachers have voiced concerns that the technology will allow for cheating and shortcuts, while disrupting the human connections at the core of learning.</p><p>At the same time, teachers are increasingly using A.I. tools themselves, to save time and make their jobs easier. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/schools-ai-teachers-writing.html" title="">My colleague Dana Goldstein talked to educators about that paradox</a>, which has prompted some difficult questions.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mario Vargas Llosa in 1988. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaime Razuri/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-66ba60d6">Remembering Mario Vargas Llosa</h2><p>The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/books/mario-vargas-llosa-dead.html" title="">died yesterday at 89</a>, was the last surviving member of Latin America’s Boom literary movement, which included other freewheeling and socially conscious writers like Gabriel García Márquez and Julio Cortázar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clement Pascal for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-314ea97d">With the No. 1 pick …</h2><p>Less than two hours after this newsletter hits your inbox, the W.N.B.A.’s Dallas Wings are all but certain to select Paige Bueckers with this year’s No. 1 overall draft pick. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/style/paige-bueckers-uconn-huskies-wnba-draft.html" title="">She’s already a star</a>.</p><p>Bueckers was a college sensation who led her UConn team to a national championship earlier this month.
