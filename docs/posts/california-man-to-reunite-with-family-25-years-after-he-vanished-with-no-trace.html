He had been staying at emergency facilities including St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood near Long Beach, Calif., for weeks.</p><p>The article, which explained that the patient could not communicate, included a photo of the man — with gray hair and blue eyes, believed to be in his mid-60s — lying in a hospital bed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Nasseri believed the patient was her missing brother, Tommy. She added an undated photograph of her brother as a younger man in a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/missing-person-found-alive-after-25-years" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GoFundMe post</a> earlier this week. Tommy had more dark hair than the man in the hospital bed but his arched eyebrows, rounded nose and deep-set eyes showed a resemblance between the two.</p><p>In an attempt to have her inclination confirmed or denied, Ms. Nasseri contacted the local authorities. Derek Kennemore, the deputy sheriff of Lassen County in Northern California, then pushed for a detective with the Missing Persons Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department to obtain the fingerprints of the unidentified patient, according to a statement from the Lassen County Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>“The Detective was able to positively identify the man as the one reported missing in 1999 from Doyle,” the statement said.</p><p>St. Francis Medical Center, the county sheriff and Ms. Nasseri did not respond to requests for comment. Tommy’s condition and how he disappeared were not immediately clear.</p><p>“He just VANISHED with no trace,” Ms. Nasseri said in her post. “Not even his vehicle was ever located.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Now, the two are working to be reunited. Ms. Nasseri lives in Lassen County, about 600 miles north of Lynwood, Calif., where her brother is staying. For the cost of a possible medical transfer as well as items like men’s clothing, pencils and paper so he can draw, Ms. Nasseri sought $500 in donations on the crowdsourcing site.</p><p>After two days, the page had raised nearly $7,000.</p><p>Some of the money, Ms. Nasseri said, would also go to buy her brother a device so he could listen to some of the songs that she remembers him loving — including one especially prescient tune by Cyndi Lauper.</p><p>“If you’re lost you can look and you will find me,” Ms. Lauper sings in one of the tunes that appeared on Tommy’s list. “Time after time.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>20</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Man Missing for 25 Years Found Alive in California<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
