There are now <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-00070.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">134 companies</a> on the list, which was posted to the Federal Register. It also added Contemporary Amperex Technology Company, known as CATL, as well as units of China Overseas Shipping, known as COSCO; the chipmaker Changxin Memory Technologies; and the drone maker Autel Robotics. China Overseas Shipping is one of the world’s largest shipping lines.</p><p>Putting Tencent on the list was “clearly a mistake,” a spokeswoman for the company said in an emailed statement. “We are not a military company or supplier.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tencent also said that the listing would have “no impact on our business,” and that it would “work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding.”</p><p>The designation is a warning to businesses in the United States that working with companies on the list could get them barred from future Pentagon contracts.</p><p>To be added to the list, a company must have some business operations within the United States. For example, CATL is licensing its battery technology to the American carmaker Ford Motor, which is building a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/13/business/energy-environment/ford-catl-electric-vehicle-battery.html" title="">$3.5 billion electric vehicle factory</a> in Michigan.</p><p>Shares of Tencent, which is listed in Hong Kong, and CATL, which trades in Shenzhen, China, slumped in Asia trading.</p><p>CATL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>As tensions between the United States and China have escalated in recent years, pressure has been growing from lawmakers to find ways to thwart China’s advances technologically and militarily.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2021, the Chinese consumer electronics company Xiaomi successfully sued the Pentagon to be removed from the blacklist after arguing in federal court that it had no ties to the Chinese military.</p><p>More recently, the countries have engaged in an escalating economic tit-for-tat. It began during the first term of President-elect Donald J. Trump, after he took aim at China with tariffs and restrictions on trade. At that time, Beijing took mostly symbolic and measured responses in retaliation.</p><p>Since then, the Biden administration has expanded its restrictions on Chinese companies and imposed bans on dual-use products, recently targeting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/business/economy/biden-china-chips-exports.html" title="">140 Chinese companies</a>. On Thursday, the administration said it was considering a new rule that could restrict or ban Chinese drones in the United States.</p><p>Beijing has adopted an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/business/china-retaliation-skydio.html" title="">increasingly aggressive</a> stance as it prepares for a second presidential term with Mr. Trump, an outspoken critic of China and its economic might.</p><p>Chinese regulators have announced an investigation into the American computer chip company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/china-nvidia-investigation-antitrust-ai.html" title="">Nvidia</a>, banned the export of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html" title="">rare minerals</a> to the United States and taken <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/business/china-retaliation-skydio.html" title="">more targeted swipes</a> at individual companies to expose their supply chain vulnerabilities.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
