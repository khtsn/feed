Israel’s military did not directly address the report but said it had struck dozens of terrorists from the air and ground, and seized additional terrorists.</p><p>In central Gaza, one Israeli strike killed a Palestinian cameraman who worked for Al Jazeera and other media outlets, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/15/palestinian-journalist-gaza-civil-defense-workers-killed-in-israeli-strike" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Al Jazeera reported</a> on Sunday. The cameraman, Ahmad Baker al-Louh, was killed in a strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp, the news agency said, along with five members of the Palestinian Civil Defense. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Al Jazeera Media Network in a statement on Sunday condemned the strike and said Mr. al-Louh had been covering the civil defense forces’ “rescue operations of a family that was severely injured in an earlier bombing.”</p><p>In its own statement, the Israeli military said that its air force had “conducted a precise strike on Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who were operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the ‘Civil Defense’ organization in Nuseirat.” It said that the center had been used to “plan and carry out an imminent terror attack” against Israeli troops, and that “numerous steps” had been taken to mitigate harm to civilian harms.</p><p>The Israelis, too, named Mr. al-Louh as among the dead, and described him as a Palestinian Islamic Jihad platoon commander. Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s chief Arabic spokesman, <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1868375448540844135" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a> that the strike killed a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad who was also a cameraman affiliated with Al Jazeera. Israel offered no evidence to back its claim.</p><p>Since October, Israel’s military has conducted some of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/northern-gaza-evacuation-risks.html" title="">most</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/gaza-jabaliya-israel.html" title="">devastating</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-beit-lahia.html" title="">attacks</a> in northern Gaza in an effort to crush what it says is a resurgence of the Hamas militant group in the area. The military has called on civilians in much of northern Gaza to evacuate, but many feel they have nowhere safe to go and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-north-evacuations.html" title="">have not left</a>.

The Palestinian Civil Defense, the main emergency service in Gaza, said in a statement on Saturday that seven people had been killed and 12 others were wounded when a school building sheltering displaced families was hit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Late on Thursday, an attack on a residential block in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least 31 people and wounded 90 others according to a spokesman for Al Awda Hospital near Jabaliya, a major medical center in northern Gaza, where the majority of the casualties were taken. Photographs taken by news agencies in the days after the strike showed people walking through the debris of severely damaged buildings. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.N.-run Majda Wasila school, which was housing displaced Palestinians, in Gaza City on Saturday after a strike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Israel’s military issued evacuation orders for parts of central and southern Gaza on Saturday, where it said that its forces were striking Hamas targets. The evacuation orders urged Palestinians in areas of central Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis to leave ahead of an imminent attack that it said was aimed at Hamas militants who were firing rockets from the area. The orders drove hundreds of people to flee on foot carrying few belongings, Wafa reported on Sunday.</p><p>Amid the fighting, and after months of stalled negotiations, cease-fire talks appeared to have picked up some momentum. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-hopes-america-sullivan.html" title="">said</a> last week that his goal was to be able to secure a deal this month between Israel and Hamas for a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages who had been captured during the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>Iyad Abuheweila<!-- --> contributed reporting from Istanbul.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hiba Yazbek covers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a focus on Palestinian affairs and society in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and Israel.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>8</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Israel Bombards Gaza; North and Center Hit<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
