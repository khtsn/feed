Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency, reported that Israeli forces had raided a school building in the town and forced displaced families sheltering there to evacuate in unsafe conditions, killing and wounding several amid bombardment and gunfire.

Israel’s military said it struck a school building in Gaza City on Saturday, describing it as a command and control center where militants were operating and planning attacks. The Palestinian Civil Defense, the main emergency service in Gaza, said in a statement on Saturday that seven people were killed and 12 others were wounded when a school building sheltering displaced families was hit.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Late on Thursday, a deadly attack on a residential block in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least 31 people and wounded 90 others according to a spokesman for Al Awda Hospital near Jabaliya, a major medical center in northern Gaza, where the majority of the casualties were taken. Photographs taken by news agencies in the days after the strike showed people walking through the debris of severely damaged buildings. The Israeli military did not comment on the strike.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The UNWRA Al-Majda Wasila School housing displaced Palestinians in Gaza City on Saturday, after a strike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israel’s military issued evacuation orders for parts of central and southern Gaza on Saturday, where it said that its forces were striking Hamas targets. The evacuation orders urged Palestinians in areas of central Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis to leave ahead of an imminent attack that it said was aimed at Hamas militants who were firing rockets from the area. The orders drove hundreds of people to flee on foot carrying few belongings, Wafa reported on Sunday.</p><p>Amid the violence, and after months of stalled negotiations, cease-fire talks appeared to have picked up some momentum.
