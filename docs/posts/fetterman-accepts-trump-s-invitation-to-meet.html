Trump ahead of his swearing-in, becoming the first Democratic senator to do so.</p><p>“President Trump invited me to meet, and I accepted,” Mr. Fetterman said in a statement. “I’m the senator for all Pennsylvanians — not just Democrats in Pennsylvania.”</p><p>He added: “I’ve been clear that no one is my gatekeeper. I will meet with and have a conversation with anyone if it helps me deliver for Pennsylvania and the nation.”</p><p>The meeting, which is expected to take place at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s estate in Florida, and was reported earlier by CBS News, offers Mr. Trump a chance to press Mr. Fetterman to support some of his nominees who will be up for Senate confirmation in the coming days. And it offers Mr. Fetterman an open channel of communication with a president-elect who has proved to be malleable on policies, and highly attentive to whomever he last spoke with.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Fetterman has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/us/politics/fetterman-democrats-israel-gaza.html" title="">undergone a change in political persona since arriving in Washington</a>. He appears to enjoy the spasms of anger he routinely produces from the left, as well as the strange new respect he commands from right-wing media outlets that once dismissed him as a vegetable and lobbed sexist attacks at his wife.</p><p>His impending visit, which has yet to be scheduled, is likely to generate more outrage from the left. But that’s just the way Mr. Fetterman likes it. On Thursday, he joked to reporters that the goal of his visit was to “demand that I be pope of Greenland.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
