Under this framework, oil-rich Gulf states would likely pay for Gaza’s reconstruction, though Egyptian officials have also suggested Europe could also contribute funds.</p><p>The Egyptian plan is “ready” to be presented to other Arab countries, Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said during a news conference with a senior European Union official in Cairo on Sunday, according to Al Qahera News, a government-linked broadcaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He called for the second phase of the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas — which is supposed to lead to a permanent end to the war — to start immediately.</p><p>On Saturday, Mr. Abdelatty said in a news conference with the Palestinian prime minister and foreign minister that Egypt had volunteered to train Palestinian police forces to be deployed in Gaza while the territory is rebuilt.</p><p>But there remains little agreement over central questions, such as how to govern Gaza, how to manage its security, how to rebuild it and what role Hamas would play, if any.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mohammad Mustafa, the Palestinian prime minister, left, and the Egyptian foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, meeting in Cairo, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohamed Hossam/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>And any plan would have to get around a more fundamental issue: While Arab leaders will support only a framework that would include at least a nominal path toward Palestinian statehood, Israeli leaders are against paving the way to Palestinian sovereignty.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Arab leaders also want the approval of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that runs the West Bank and also administered Gaza until Hamas seized control of the strip in 2007.
