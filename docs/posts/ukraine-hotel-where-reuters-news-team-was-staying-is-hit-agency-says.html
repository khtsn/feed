Three people were killed and nine others were wounded.</p></div></div><div><div><p>There was no independent confirmation of either of the reports.</p><p>Daily cross-border shelling in northeastern Ukraine has been a constant backdrop of the war, taking a deadly toll on villages, according to officials from both sides who rarely acknowledge attacks by their own forces. But the military situation has become more acute since Aug. 6, when Ukrainian troops and armored vehicles stormed into the Kursk region of western Russia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion.html" title="">swiftly pushing through Russian defenses</a> and capturing several villages.</p><p>That offensive was partly aimed at diverting Russian forces from the eastern front in the Donetsk region, the part of the long front line that has been most active this year, but it has slowed in recent days.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3898462-kursk-operation-showed-it-is-more-important-for-putin-to-hold-foreign-territories-than-to-protect-his-own-zelensky.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that one aim</a> of the incursion was to demonstrate that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was more interested in retaining territory Moscow has occupied in Ukraine than defending Russian villages.</p><p>Russia illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and since its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukraine began in February 2022, it has occupied and illegally annexed parts of the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine as well as a substantial part of Ukraine’s east.</p><p>Mr. Putin “is still thinking about how to keep the occupied territories and does not think about how to protect his people,” Mr. Zelensky said during a news conference on Saturday with the leaders of Poland and Lithuania. He also said that the incursion aimed to stop Moscow’s own plans to launch an offensive in northern Ukraine and to occupy Sumy region.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
