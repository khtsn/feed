The Misalignment A.I. Museum, which started in 2023 as an eight-week pop-up, is set to move into a larger, permanent space in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood and reopen in February. And Artificially Unintelligent has become a monthly event and is seeking to expand into other cities.</p><p>Some of the creative work about A.I. is coming from tech industry insiders laughing at the hype or raising alarms about the dangers. Some of it is coming from outsiders fascinated by the industry’s intrigue.</p><p>A.I. has become a meaty topic for artists to dissect, invoke and mock even as they fight its use as a tool in their fields. In October, more than 10,000 actors, authors and musicians signed a letter opposing the use of their works to train A.I. systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At least 10 groups, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/technology/ai-voice-clone-lawsuit.html" title="">voice actors</a>, the Recording Industry Association of America and The New York Times, have sued A.I. companies, claiming the technology unlawfully used copyrighted work without permission. And many artists, from graphic designers to movie stars, have expressed concern that the A.I. could soon replace them.</p><p>“It’s definitely a big topic that’s affecting us all, and we should have everyone who is affected by it be part of the conversation,” said Audrey Kim, the museum’s founder and curator.</p><h2 id="link-18cd1250">From Misalignment to Marie Antoinette</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Audrey Kim, founder and curator of the Misalignment A.I.

Her colleagues would have lunchtime debates about the role of A.I. in society. In recent years, as that debate became more mainstream, Ms. Kim decided that art could be a way to bridge the gap between the people building A.I. and the rest of us.</p><p>Initially her museum, which is a nonprofit supported by donations, focused entirely on addressing the risks of A.I. But through discussions with people working in tech, Ms. Kim, realized there was no consensus among techies on what A.I.’s risks to humanity were, or even a universal understanding about how it worked. So she shifted to education and asking the big questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>One exhibit is a phone booth made for conversations with an A.I. version of the television legend Fred Rogers.

Matthew Gasda said he had been inspired to write the play after following Mr. Altman’s firing on social media last year. The abrupt ouster set off a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/technology/open-ai-sam-altman-what-happened.html" title="">public debate</a> over potential dangers of OpenAI’s technology and whether Mr. Altman was ignoring them.</p><p>While researching those conversations, Mr. Gasda, 35, decided that the people building this new technology were not any more qualified to have debates about its role in society than anyone else.</p><p>“It’s just millennials with a ton of power,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Gasda’s previous plays were similarly of the moment. “Zoomers” was about young people in New York. “Dimes Square” was about the city’s postpandemic downtown scene. He often stages casual readings of drafts of his scripts, then collects audience feedback and adapts. He told the audience in San Francisco that this process might be familiar.</p><p>“You all know about beta testing and releasing products that don’t work,” he said to laughter.</p><p>That version of “Doomers” hit on tropes familiar to anyone who has followed tech culture in recent years: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/15/magazine/polycule-polyamory-boston.html" title="">polycules</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/technology/waymo-expansion-alphabet.html" title="">Waymo</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/business/dealbook/silicon-valley-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">p(doom)</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-microdosing-ketamine-lsd-magic-mushrooms-d381e214" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ketamine</a>. The characters, based on Mr. Altman and his peers at OpenAI, had heated ethical debates about benevolence and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/opinion/nuclear-fusion-flying-cars.html" title="">abundance</a>. At one point, Mr. Altman’s character (called Seth in the play) grabs a knife and demands that someone stab him because doing so would lower the probability of A.I.-induced doom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Some of the early viewers worked at Anthropic, a rival to OpenAI, and they agreed with the play’s message that A.I. poses a threat to the world. Mr. Gasda said the wave of resignations at OpenAI in recent months further validated his thesis.</p><p>“I told the actors, ‘I think we’re onto something here,’” he said.</p><h2 id="link-188b349e">Court jesters</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Neal Patel at Artificially Unintelligent, a comedy show about working in tech.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachael Zahn/Avenue Z</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>At Artificially Unintelligent, the threat from A.I. was not quite as dire. Onstage, the host, Neal Patel, surveyed the audience of 120 about their roles in the industry, cheering on the “value-add engineers” and poking fun at the people with “nontechnical fake email jobs.” To the founders, he asked, “Why are you here and not building?”</p><p>He joked that A.I. would soon take everyone’s jobs.</p><p>Mr. Patel, 24, started his comedy group, Not-So-Daily Stand Up, in part because he and his fellow techie comedians kept hearing other comedians make jokes about technology that misunderstood how it worked. The group’s roster of around 55 comedians all have day jobs in tech. (Mr. Patel is an engineer.)</p><p>“The credentials back up the jokes,” he said.</p><p>Even as A.I. threatens to replace workers, including engineers, Mr. Patel said, a common theme among his peers is how limited the technology’s abilities actually are.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“We’re all dealing with the same crap where a nontechnical manager says, ‘Can we use A.I. for that?’ And we say, ‘No.’ And they say, ‘Try it anyway,’” Mr. Patel said.</p><p>Lately, tech companies have invited Mr. Patel’s comedy group to come roast them. The setup tests whether Silicon Valley’s famous “radical candor” extends to delicate egos of those at the top. But comedians can get away with saying things others can’t, Mr. Patel said. “It’s almost like us being a bunch of court jesters.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erin Griffith covers tech companies, start-ups and the culture of Silicon Valley from San Francisco.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erin-griffith">More about Erin Griffith</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/openai">OpenAI</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Coverage of Artificial Intelligence</h2><hr/><p><strong>News</strong><strong> and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p>Meta will allow U.S. government agencies and contractors working on national security to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/technology/meta-ai-military.html">use its A.I. models for military purposes</a>.
