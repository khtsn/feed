He accused his political opponents of plotting an “insurgency” and “trying to overthrow the free democracy.” But six hours later, after the country’s legislature unanimously voted to end it, Yoon rescinded the order.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/03/world/south-korea-martial-law" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>It was the first time that a South Korean president had imposed martial law since a military dictatorship ended in the country in the late 1980s. Army Gen. Park An-su, who was appointed martial law commander, banned “all political activities,” including political party activities and citizens’ rallies, and labor activities. The backlash was swift. Thousands of protesters flooded the streets and gathered at the National Assembly in the middle of the night, chanting “End Martial Law!”</p><p>The announcement came as a shock to many around the world. For years, South Korea has been known as a model of cultural soft power and an Asian democratic stalwart. Yoon, who was elected president in 2022, has been in a near-constant political standoff with the opposition, which controls Parliament. He characterized his decision to impose martial law as an act “of national resolve against the anti-state forces that are trying to paralyze the essential functions of the state.”</p><p>But dissent quickly emerged within his own political party. Within hours, Yoon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-president.html" title="">who is deeply unpopular</a>, convened his cabinet, which agreed to end martial law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Joe Biden delivered remarks on his economic policies in Belen, New Mexico, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2e162c68">Biden is hoping Republicans will help him preserve his triumphs</h2><p>Donald Trump has promised to begin unraveling President Biden’s policies as soon as he takes office in January. That could include the Inflation Reduction Act, the president’s signature legislation. But Biden is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/us/politics/biden-trump-legislation-republicans.html" title="">hoping to prevent that by appealing to Republican lawmakers</a>.</p><p>The president and his aides have tried to emphasize that the law overwhelmingly benefits Republican districts, in the hopes that Trump would face blowback from his own party if he repealed it. Some Republicans are joining the effort: In Georgia, local officials said they were worried that reversing the act could take away newly created factory jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rare earth mineral mine in Inner Mongolia, China, in 2011.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">China Network/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-62b24f35">China banned rare mineral exports to the U.S.</h2><p>China said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html" title="">it would begin banning the export of several rare minerals to the U.S.</a>, an escalation of the tech war between the world’s two biggest powers. The materials — including gallium, germanium, antimony and so-called superhard minerals — are used to make products like armor-piercing bullets, fiber optics and semiconductors.</p><p>The ban, which came a day after the U.S. tightened Chinese access to advanced American technology, signals Beijing’s willingness to engage in supply chain warfare. China generally refrained from clamping down on its own exports during the first Trump administration.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chantal Jahchan</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-2136d2c1">The 10 best books of 2024</h2><p>The staff of The New York Times Book Review spent nearly all of 2024 debating the year’s most exceptional books.

But in 1892, when the ballet was first performed, the celesta had just been invented, and its playful sound really did feel novel. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/arts/music/celesta-nutcracker-holiday-music.html" title="">You can hear its imprint on music for decades</a>.</p><p>Have a whimsical evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
