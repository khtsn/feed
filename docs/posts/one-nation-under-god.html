And in fact, it’s high; it’s stable,” said Penny Edgell, a sociologist at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>The United States is an outlier compared with most other Western countries, which are far less religious. America’s persistent religious and spiritual curiosity is visible in its centers of power. In Washington, President Trump and JD Vance talk a lot about God in their quest to remake America. In Silicon Valley, tech billionaires — long obsessed with religion-adjacent projects like artificial intelligence, transhumanism and immortality — are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/business/silicon-valley-christianity.html" title="">warming</a> to Christianity.

It was a major shift that affected how people voted, when they married and where they lived. Christianity took the hardest hit: Around 15 percent of American adults who once went to church stopped going. While some people switched to new faiths, many left religion altogether.</p><p>Experts called this phenomenon the “rise of the nones,” a group that includes atheists, agnostics and people who said in surveys that they identified with “nothing in particular.” The nones grew to include about 30 percent of the country.</p><p>But the rise of the nones has stopped, Pew found. People are no longer leaving churches en masse, and other major religions are growing, largely because of immigration. </p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="ambriefing-religion-decline-jp87" data-id="100000010012292" data-source-id="100000010012292"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Share of U.S. adults who identify as Christian</h2></header><div slug="ambriefing-religion-decline-jp87" data-sourceid="100000010012292" id="embed-id-100000010012292">

Pew found that people turned to faith for support during those years, as the number of people going to religious services — either in person or virtually — remained consistent at about 40 percent. About a quarter of Americans even told Pew that the pandemic had strengthened their faith. “Religion was in their psychological tool kit for dealing with the hard times,” said Alan Cooperman, an author of the report.</p><p>The second explanation is that secularization has a limit in the United States.</p><p>Americans pray more often, are more likely to attend weekly religious services and value faith in their lives more than adults in other wealthy democracies like Canada, Australia and most European countries, Pew found in a separate study. Americans — both religious and not — also report high levels of spirituality: Eighty-three percent say they believe in God or a universal spirit, Pew found.</p><p>Ryan Burge, a political scientist, argues that most people who disagree with their religion on political or social issues — on Trumpism, abortion or gay marriage, for instance — have already left or switched faiths. “What’s left is like the bedrock of American religion, which is exceptionally large,<em>” </em>he said. The report reveals how many people remain committed to their religious traditions even after those defections.</p><h2 id="link-ea0109">What does this mean?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>We’re in a moment of resurgent religious conservatism.
