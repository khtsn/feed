As written, the legislation would cut health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Mr. Musk said he was not sold on a bill that has emerged as the president’s top legislative priority. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,” Mr. Musk said. “But I don’t know if it can be both.”</p><p>A combination of Mr. Trump’s lobbying and compromises struck by Speaker Mike Johnson managed to get the bill through the House, but it faces significant hurdles in the Senate. Republicans hold only a slim margin in the chamber, and two <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/fiscal-hawks-senate-house-bill.html" title="">fiscal conservatives</a> have said they want significant changes on the grounds that the bill lacks concrete measures to reduce the national deficit.</p><p>Asked about Mr. Musk’s comments on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump declined to engage directly with them. But he defended the bill generally and said it contains the provisions it does because “No. 1, we have to get a lot of votes,” with Democrats unified in opposition.</p><p>If the bill is not approved, Mr. Trump<span>  </span>said, “this country is going to get a 65 percent increase in taxes and lots of other problems, big problems, almost bigger than that.” He added, “We will be negotiating that bill and I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it. That’s the way that goes.”</p><p>Mr. Musk — who spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-rbg-election.html" title="">more than $250 million to help Mr. Trump’s campaign</a> — joined the White House as a “special government employee” to lead the DOGE effort, which Mr. Trump hailed as one of his biggest accomplishments. The effort, which set the lofty goal of slashing $1 trillion from the federal budget but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">has fallen far short of that goal</a>, has led to clashes with cabinet secretaries and complaints from some lawmakers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Musk’s support for Mr. Trump has also caused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk.html" title="">sales to plummet at Tesla</a>, his electric car company, and last week the billionaire said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-political-spending.html" title="">spend less time</a> in Washington and more time running his companies.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Jenner &amp; Block: </strong>A federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-jenner-block-law-firm.html">struck down an executive order</a> that threatened penalties against the law firm, which once employed a top attorney who helped investigate the president alongside the team run by Robert Mueller, who was then the special counsel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restricting Covid Shots: </strong>The Food and Drug Administration announced that it was likely to limit access to Covid vaccines among healthy children and adults this fall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/health/covid-vaccine-restrictions-eligibility.html">Here’s what experts expect if the plan goes forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Crypto Dinner:</strong> The Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to identify who was invited to President Trump’s private event for customers of his cryptocurrency business and a White House tour. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-crypto-dinner-attendees.html">Here are some of them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build-Out of Nuclear Power Plants:</strong> President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/climate/trump-executive-order-nuclear-power.html">accelerating the construction of the plants</a>, including a new generation of small, advanced reactors that offer the promise of faster deployment but have yet to be proven.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignoring Economic Warning Signs: </strong>The president’s economic policy approach is so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-taxes-tariffs-economy.html">rattling markets, businesses and consumers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>MAHA Report: </strong>The G.O.P. chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were “troubled” by the Make America Healthy Again Commission’s findings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republican-agriculture-pesticides-kennedy-maha-report.html">urged it to use sounder science</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Rare Check on Trump’s Actions: </strong>President Trump has suffered a string of court losses, as federal judges ruled that his administration broke the law on a number of matters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-courts-judges-law.html">But judicial orders to unwind his actions can be easier said than done</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
