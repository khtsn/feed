Earlier this week, he visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar on the first major international visit of his second term.</p><p>Here are some key developments from Mr. Trump’s trip:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Syria meeting:</strong> Mr. Trump spoke with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-syria-al-shara-sanctions.html" title="">an extraordinary meeting</a> that reversed longstanding U.S. policies toward the country and Mr. Shara, a former militant who once led a branch of Al Qaeda. A day earlier, Mr. Trump announced that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, which would offer a significant economic lifeline to a country devastated by years of civil war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deals, deals, deals:</strong> The White House has said Mr. Trump’s visit resulted in deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/qatar-airways-boeing-jets.html" title="">a large order from Qatar</a> for Boeing passenger jets. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-deals-middle-east-saudi-arabia-qatar-uae.html" title="">details have been sparse</a> and some of the agreements had already been in the works.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran negotiations:</strong> Mr. Trump also suggested that there had been progress in nuclear talks with Iran. While insisting that the United States would not allow Tehran to develop a nuclear weapon, he said his administration was in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/trump-negotiations-irans-nuclear-deal.html" title="">very serious negotiations</a> with Iran for long-term peace.”</p></li><li><p><strong>War in Gaza:</strong> Mr. Trump did not visit America’s biggest regional ally, Israel, and largely sidestepped the conflict in Gaza even as Israeli strikes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza.html" title="">killed dozens</a> of Palestinians across the territory. On Friday, he said he wanted to see the conflict resolved and made a rare acknowledgment of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-starvation-israel.html" title="">civilian suffering</a> there. “There’s a lot of people starving, a lot of bad things going on,” he said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine talks:</strong> Mr. Trump kept people guessing over whether he would travel to Turkey to bolster cease-fire talks involving Russia and Ukraine, but ultimately decided not to go. Russian and Ukrainian officials were in Istanbul for talks, along with top Trump administration officials, but President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was not attending and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">expectations for a breakthrough were low</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Qasim Nauman is a Times editor in Seoul, covering breaking news from around the world.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
