It was the deadliest episode in the waterway this year as the French and British governments struggle to prevent attempts at the perilous crossing.</p><p>Gérald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, <a href="https://x.com/GDarmanin/status/1830960072509235492" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on the social media platform X</a> that the vessel sank off the coast of Wimereux, in an area of the Pas-de-Calais region where several similar tragedies have occurred this year. Two people were still missing and several others were injured, Mr. Darmanin said.</p><p>“All government services are mobilized to find the missing and care for the victims,” he said.</p><p>The French maritime authorities said in a statement that dozens of people fell into the sea after their vessel encountered unspecified difficulties on Tuesday morning off the coast of Cap Gris-Nez, which at some points is less than 30 miles from the British coastline.</p><p>Rescue workers picked up 65 people out of the water, some of them in critical condition, and rescue operations involving helicopters and fishing and Navy ships are still continuing, the maritime authorities said in a statement. Frédéric Cuvillier, the mayor of Boulogne-sur-Mer, a nearby town, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fcuvillier2/posts/1066161481542026?ref=embed_post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that nearly 70 people had been on board the boat when it sank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The French authorities did not identify the people who died or say where they were from, and they did not specify the causes of death.</p><p>One of the worst migrant-related accidents in the Channel happened in 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/world/europe/migrants-boat-capsize-calais.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">when 27 people died after their boat capsized</a>, but similar tragedies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/world/europe/uk-migrant-boat-capsize-english-channel.html?searchResultPosition=9" title="">repeatedly occurred</a> on a smaller scale. Five people died at sea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/14/world/europe/migrants-die-english-channel.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">in January</a> near Wimereux as well; five people died in similar circumstances around the same area <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/europe/france-uk-migrant-deaths-english-channel.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">in April.</a></p><p>Last week, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France pledged to increase cooperation in the English Channel and to dismantle human smuggling networks, which the authorities on both sides of the waterway have blamed for the repeated deaths.</p><p>“The leaders agreed to do more together to dismantle smuggling routes further upstream and increase intelligence sharing,” Mr. Starmer’s office said in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-meeting-with-president-macron-of-france-29-august-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> after the two leaders met in Paris.</p><p>Nearly 36,000 people trying to reach Britain were the subject of search-and-rescue operations in the English Channel in 2023, <a href="https://www.premar-manche.gouv.fr/dossier/bilan-2023-des-operationnel-de-la-prefecture-maritime-manche-et-mer-du-nord" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a report</a> by the French maritime authorities, down from over 51,000 in 2022.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But the average number of people per boat grew to 50 from 30 — making <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/25/world/europe/english-channel-migrant-crossings.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a perilous crossing</a> even more dangerous, according to the report. Last year, 12 people attempting the crossing died in France’s search-and-rescue zone, the report said.</p><p>The Channel is one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. Its waters are especially icy in the winter, winds can be treacherous, and migrants trying to cross often crowd onto flimsy inflatable boats.</p><p>“It’s a particularly dangerous sector even when the sea looks calm,” the maritime authorities said in their <a href="https://www.premar-manche.gouv.fr/communiques-presse/naufrage-d-une-embarcation-de-migrants-au-large-du-cap-gris-nez-62-communique-de-presse-n-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>Most of those who try to cross the Channel leave from the Pas-de-Calais. Many are from Afghanistan, Albania, Eritrea, Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Syria, according to the French authorities, and they cluster in makeshift camps on the coast of northern France before trying to cross.</p><p>Many prefer risking the trip over staying in France because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/world/europe/uk-record-immigration.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">they see Britain as an attractive destination</a> with a strong job market where English is spoken, or because they already have family there or people they know from their home country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At least 19,294 people have arrived in England across the Channel on small boats since the start of 2024, according to British government data, comparable to the number of arrivals in the first eight months of the previous year.</p><p>The small boat arrivals across the Channel have become a major point of political tension in Britain after the former Conservative government vowed to “stop the boats” and introduced a plan to send <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/28/world/africa/uk-rwanda-asylum-seekers.html?searchResultPosition=20" title="">asylum seekers to Rwanda</a>.</p><p>Mr. Starmer’s Labour government announced after a landslide victory in July that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/world/europe/uk-rwanda-deportation-plan.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">scrap those plans</a>. Since then, though, the issue of immigration has taken center stage, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/europe/uk-immigration-riots-starmer.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">with far-right riots rattling cities across Britain this summer.</a></p><p>Though the number of boat arrivals <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/people-crossing-the-english-channel-in-small-boats/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has risen significantly since 2018</a>, they make up just a fraction of immigration into Britain overall, and the majority of people making this crossing are asylum seekers fleeing war and persecution.</p><p>Some 93 percent of the people who arrived in small boats from 2018 to March 2024 claimed asylum, and of those who had received a decision by March 31, 2024, around three-quarters were successful, <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/people-crossing-the-english-channel-in-small-boats/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yvette Cooper, Britain’s home secretary, whose office oversees immigration into the country, called Tuesday’s deaths “a horrifying and deeply tragic incident.”</p><p>“The gangs behind this appalling and callous trade in human lives have been cramming more and more people onto increasingly unseaworthy dinghies, and sending them out into the Channel even in very poor weather,” she said. “They do not care about anything but the profits they make.”</p><p>Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, a British charity that supports asylum seekers and refugees, said in a statement on Tuesday that “the number of deaths in the Channel this year has been shockingly high.”</p><p>The British and French authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/europe/france-britain-macron-sunak-migrants.html" title="">agreed last year</a> that Britain would pay France 541 million pounds, currently more than $700 million, over three years to help pay for drones, a new detention center and hundreds of additional police officers to patrol beaches in northern France — one of several deals that the two countries have struck over the past few years to try to reduce the number of crossings.</p><p>But “enforcement alone is not the solution,” Mr. Solomon said. “Heightened security and policing measures on the French coast have led to increasingly perilous crossings, launching from more dangerous locations and in flimsy, overcrowded vessels.”</p><p>He added that the British government needed to take action against the criminal gangs that are often responsible for smuggling people across the Channel, but also “must develop a plan to improve and expand safe routes for those seeking safety.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Specia reports on Britain, Ireland and the Ukraine war for The Times.
