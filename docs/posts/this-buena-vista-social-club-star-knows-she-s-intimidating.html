    <h1>This ‘Buena Vista Social Club’ Star Knows She’s Intimidating</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>As she exits the stage door of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/theater/buena-vista-social-club-review-broadway.html" title="">“Buena Vista Social Club,”</a> the Broadway actress Natalie Venetia Belcon can see it in their eyes. The waiting fans thrust Playbills and pens into the hands of her co-stars, but when Belcon comes down the line, she senses their shyness, their wariness.</p><p>“They’re afraid,” she said. “It’s so weird. I’m like, ‘You guys, I’m pretending!’”</p><p>Onstage, Belcon, 56, plays the middle-aged version of Omara Portuondo, the famed Cuban singer known as “the queen of feeling.” (Isa Antonetti portrays the teen version.) Belcon’s Omara is stately, imperious. “You’re not the kind of woman one forgets,” a bandmate in the show tells her. She can dismiss a person with a tilt of the head, a wave of the hand. The role has earned Belcon a Tony nomination, her first, for best performance by a featured actress in a musical.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman in a yellow print outfit sings and dances center stage while musicians on guitars, drums and bongos play behind her." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/01/multimedia/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw/01cul-buena-vista-belcon-pbtw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f51c0878-6f4c-57f4-8b0e-5e7be914fe8e" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Natalie Venetia Belcon as Omara, with members of the onstage band, in “Buena Vista Social Club” at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Belcon is, she insists, not Omara, but some of this same majesty was evident even over a casual afternoon snack of calamari and plantains at <a href="https://cubanyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cuba</a>, a restaurant in Manhattan’s West Village neighborhood. The waiter seemed honored to shake up a mojito for her. Belcon, dressed like some expensive, resplendent bird in a blue-and-yellow skirt and matching jewelry, looked regal as she sipped it.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Then she pointed to the stalk of sugar cane in the glass. “Oh, I love sugar cane!” she said delightedly. “I grew up chewing on it. Then you catch yourself in the mirror, like, ‘That doesn’t look sexy!’”</p><p>Belcon insists that in her downtime, offstage, away from journalists, she is an everyday sort of woman who prefers oversize T-shirts and yoga pants. She loves to put on her bunny slippers and watch the UFC.</p><p>“I know I’m intimidating, but once somebody starts to speak to me, they realize, ‘Oh, she’s actually kind of cool,&#39;” she said.</p><p>Belcon was born in Trinidad. She began traveling to the United States as a child and by junior high, she and her parents and grandparents were sharing a multifamily home in the South Bronx. She became a citizen as a teenager. Her parents are musicians. Singing and dancing were a given. Though she dabbled in science, she applied and was accepted to the High School of Performing Arts. “It was the best time,” she said, “a party.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I like doing something other than what I am.

The training was excellent, but she found some of the teachers insensitive, even bullying. “Neither one of my parents raised a shrinking violet,” she said. “When some of these tactics were pulled that made others shrink, it made me want to fight back.” Still, she described herself as one of the lucky ones, a darling of the department.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After graduation she shot an episode of “The Cosby Show,” then returned to the East Coast, understudying Karen Mason in a Kander and Ebb revue, and later booking a national tour of “Once on This Island.” That tour ended in Los Angeles and Belcon stayed, finding guest roles on popular sitcoms and dramas of the early 1990s (“Melrose Place,” “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”). She was doing well, but the sameness of the roles began to bore her.</p><p>“I was the pretty, exotic girl, very elitist and rich, always breaking somebody’s heart,” she said. “I had a great time. But I’ve always considered myself a character actor. I like doing something other than what I am. That’s where the fun stuff is.”</p><p>So she came back to New York, where she has worked consistently over the last few decades, though rarely with much fanfare. She has made it to Broadway several times, including as a replacement Joanne in “Rent.” Most notably she originated the role of Gary Coleman, a comedic version of the child star, in the 2003 puppet musical <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/01/movies/theater-review-a-feeling-you-re-not-on-sesame-street.html" title="">“Avenue Q.”</a> But stardom has always been just out of reach. There were parts she didn’t get and parts she did, though these were in regional and Off Broadway shows that closed without transferring.</p><p>“It wasn’t meant to be,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Tony nominee originally told her agent she wasn’t right for the part of Omara because she grew up speaking English, not Spanish.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2023, she received the call about “Buena Vista Social Club” while touring with “Wicked.” She knew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/arts/music/buena-vista-social-club-anniversary.html" title="">the double platinum album</a> that the show in part derives from and had seen <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/060499buena-film-review.html" title="">the documentary</a>. But she wasn’t right for it, she told her agent, mostly because she grew up speaking English, not Spanish, which would make singing the Spanish-language songs a challenge. But she was told that speaking Spanish was not a must. She auditioned with the bolero <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dos+gardenias+buena+vista+social+club+cast+album&amp;sca_esv=449df59cb87f206b&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_en&amp;ei=2GA4aIDJCNmj5NoP_aDooAY&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAleid5MiNAxXZEVkFHX0QGmQQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=dos+gardenias+buena+vista+social+club+cast+album&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiMGRvcyBnYXJkZW5pYXMgYnVlbmEgdmlzdGEgc29jaWFsIGNsdWIgY2FzdCBhbGJ1bTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAFIghNQ4QNYmRFwAXgBkAEAmAFroAGVCKoBAzcuNLgBA8gBAPgBAZgCDKACzQjCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgIQEC4YgAQYsAMYQxjUAhiKBcICBRAAGIAEwgIGEAAYFhgewgIIEAAYFhgKGB7CAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICBRAAGO8FwgIFECEYqwLCAgUQIRifBZgDAIgGAZAGCZIHAzYuNqAHsUiyBwM1Lja4B8gIwgcFMS40LjfIByc&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:1676be66,vid:fugRvM6s5fc,st:0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Dos Gardenias”</a> and was soon cast.</p><p>Before the show’s 2023 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/theater/buena-vista-social-club-review.html" title="">Off Broadway debut</a>, at Atlantic Theater Company, she worked hard to master the accent, particularly the vowel placement. She listened to the music, watched videos, consulted the Cubans in her life. “I prayed to the gods every second of the day,” she said. She is still praying. Even now, before she goes onstage she says to herself, “Spirit, be with me.” So far the spirits have been kind.</p><p>Because the story at the heart of the show is largely fictional, Belcon didn’t feel particular pressure to imitate the real Portuondo. Still, she relied on the band members, some of whom had worked with Portuondo, to help her convey her essence, her aura, her carriage.</p><p>“She doesn’t need to do much to grab your attention,” Belcon said. “It’s just a small little turn of the head, and she just has you.” Belcon was moved when Portuondo, now 94, visited the theater on opening night and later came onstage for a curtain call.</p><p>Some performers tend to minimize awards or riff on the “it’s an honor just to be nominated” idea. But Belcon has worked too long and too hard to take that tack. Which is to say she won’t be wearing bunny slippers. What does she want on Tonys night?</p><p>“For my name to be called,” she said regally. “I didn’t do all this for nothing. No, I want it. And I have to say, I think I deserve it for this one. That would not be a mistake to call my name.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alexis Soloski has written for The Times since 2006.
