His tone can be professorial with occasional flashes of bone-dry humor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He lacks the obvious charisma of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, who during his heyday made crowds swoon.</p><p>And he also lacks the polished, retail-politician presentation of his chief election opponent, Pierre Poilievre, 45, the Conservative Party leader.</p><p>And after years in high-level positions overseas, detractors say he is out of touch with Canada and Canadians.</p><p>But while Mr. Carney is a novice in elected office, his pitch to Canadians is that he is experienced in what he says Canada needs right now: a leader as different as can be from Mr. Trump, and a steady hand to direct Canada through a generational challenge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/multimedia/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/multimedia/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/multimedia/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Mr. Carney, wearing suit, walks down a hallway, near another man in a suit." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/multimedia/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/multimedia/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/multimedia/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/multimedia/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh/26int-canada-carney-hour-mtgh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/52094f30-07bd-510d-94b1-c27ec932b6b5" decoding="async" width="600" height="426"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carney after a meeting this month on Canada’s relations with Washington and national security on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-10bff9e3">Meeting the Moment</h2><p>“If it’s not a crisis, you wouldn’t be seeing me,” Mr. Carney told a <a href="https://www.collingwoodtoday.ca/local-news/tired-of-being-divided-carney-touts-positive-agenda-during-barrie-stop-video-10307232" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local news</a> outlet in early March, days before he was elected to replace Mr. Trudeau as leader of the Liberals and becoming prime minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I’m most useful in a crisis,” he added. “I’m not that good in peacetime.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, since his election in November, has pushed menacing rhetoric about Canada, threatening to make the country the 51st state. He has also made Canada, America’s top ally and trading partner, the target of waves of tariffs, hurting Canadian exports and industries.</p><p>Some economists predict the levies will push the country into a recession, and an economic slowdown appears inevitable.</p><p>Canada, a middle power permanently connected to the United States by sheer geography, depends on its southern neighbor for its security.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s upending of the world order — his embrace of Russia, all-out trade war with China and attack on other Western allies — leaves Canada unmoored in a changing world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Carney says he is the man to deal with all this.</p><p>He has built his campaign around Mr. Trump’s threat to Canada, promising to negotiate a holistic new deal with the United States to tackle trade and other areas. And he has leaned into Mr. Trump’s annexation threats, presenting himself as Canada’s defender.</p><p>“Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us. It is our strength that the Americans want,” he told supporters at a recent rally. “They want our resources, they want our water, they want our land, they want our country. They can’t have it.”</p><p>Mr. Carney did not agree to an interview with The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carney in a personalized Montreal Canadiens hockey jersey during a campaign rally in Laval, Quebec.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrej Ivanov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-52a8f8fe">International Brand</h2><p>Mr. Carney has brandished his international connections to convince Canadians that he can line up allies.</p><p>Since becoming prime minister in March, he has visited London and Paris, and started negotiating a military industry agreement between Canada and the European Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Born in the Northwest Territories and raised mostly in Edmonton, Alberta, Mr. Carney was one of four children. Their parents were teachers. He left Canada to study at Harvard and then the University of Oxford, where he met his wife, Diana Fox Carney, also an economist. They have four children.</p><p>Mr. Carney spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs in offices around the world before returning to Canada and working at the finance ministry.</p><p>In 2008, he became governor of the Bank of Canada, helping Canada survive the global financial crisis as the U.S. banking system went into meltdown. </p><p>In 2013, because of his perceived success in that role, he was hired as governor of the Bank of England, the first non-British citizen in the institution’s history to hold the position.</p><p>He was tasked with guiding the pound and Britain’s vital banking sector through the disruption of Brexit, when the country pulled out of the European Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Carney has been using his Brexit experience to highlight that he understands the hinge moment Canada faces with Mr. Trump in the White House.</p><p>“I have seen this movie before.

Since 2020 and up until January, when he resigned to run for Liberal leader, Mr. Carney was the chairman of the board of directors at Brookfield Asset Management, a Canadian investment giant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He has been blamed for the company’s offshore tax tactics, its China expansion and its investment choices, all of which may have been reflective of shrewd management of a private enterprise, but are not necessarily appealing to voters. Tax avoidance by corporations is seen as legal cheating by many voters, while Canadians have soured on China because of a crisis in the relationship between the two countries.</p><p>And Mr. Carney has been defensive of both his past lives and his private wealth, at times snapping at reporters for pressing him to disclose his investments, and stressing that he has followed Canada’s ethics rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carney has campaigned as a pragmatic centrist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carlos Osorio/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-d2e9e59">A Devoted Centrist</h2><p>Mr. Carney is promoting himself as a centrist and pragmatist, in contrast to his predecessor, Mr. Trudeau, who skewed left and was criticized for pursuing ideologically driven policies at the expense of real-world outcomes.</p><p>When he became prime minister, Mr. Carney swiftly ditched a tax on household carbon emissions that was deeply unpopular, despite having once been a vocal proponent of this type of policy as one of the world&#39;s most prominent advocates for sustainable, green finance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Carney seems to be trying to respond to many Canadians’ desire for change after 10 years of Liberal rule under Mr. Trudeau, even as the Conservative Party tries to make the case that there’s hardly any difference between the two men.</p><p>Mr. Carney’s party is polling about three percentage points ahead of the Conservatives as the country heads to the polls.</p><p>He has also tried to strike an even, mild tone in his campaign, in contrast to Mr. Poilievre’s combative rhetoric.</p><p>But people who know Mr. Carney point out that, behind closed doors, the economist has a tough side and, at times, a temper.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many of Mr. Carney’s former co-workers spoke admiringly of him.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carlos Osorio/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-3783fbf5">Exacting Boss</h2><p>In his previous roles, Mr. Carney had a reputation for being the smartest guy in the room. And former co-workers say he provided clear and decisive leadership — something that people who liked his direction appreciated, but sometimes made others feel bulldozed.</p><p>The Times spoke to five people who worked for Mr. Carney and did not want to be named because their current roles require them to be politically neutral.</p><p>Several said Mr. Carney would swiftly shut down ideas or debates he felt were wrong — a practice that became known as “getting tasered” among Bank of England staff, because it felt like a sharp, unpleasant jolt.</p><p>But most former co-workers spoke admiringly of him and several said he professionalized the Bank of England in a way that was inclusive and changed some long-held cliquey traditions.</p><p>“He’s very competent, he’s very confident — the guy masters his briefs like nobody,” said Anil Kashyap an economist at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, who has known Mr. Carney for years and worked with him at the Bank of England.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>If Mr. Carney needed to learn about a topic, Mr. Kashyap said, “he’s going to have looked at it from three different directions.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Carney picking up pizzas this month in Sault Ste.

Most surveys show the Liberals are poised to secure a majority in Parliament, after two consecutive minority governments led by Mr. Trudeau.</p><p>At a rally in Surrey, British Columbia, last week, Barb and Hannah Gelfant, a mother and daughter who had driven 90 minutes to be there, said Mr. Carney was both reassuring in standing up to Mr. Trump and in preserving progressive values.</p><p>“For me it matters that he says everyone is free to love who they want to love,” said Ms. Gelfant, 25. “It is archaic to me that there can be politicians in Canada who do not acknowledge the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community.”</p><p>“From a financial perspective, he knows what he’s doing,” said her mother, Barb, 65.</p><p>Bryan Pezzi, 53, a library worker, chimed in: “Mark Carney is uniquely qualified,” he said. “He is the adult in the room.”</p><p>Jeanna Smialek<!-- --> contributed reporting from Brussels, and <!-- -->Eshe Nelson<!-- --> from London.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
