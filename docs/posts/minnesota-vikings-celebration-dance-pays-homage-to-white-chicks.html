Not good. Not even meh. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/23/movies/film-review-fbi-agents-in-drag-enjoy-wild-hamptons-weekend.html" title="">New York Times review</a> of the film suggested viewers might want to prepare for it with “a full frontal lobotomy.”</p><p>Yet somehow, 20 years later, “White Chicks” is still hanging around. An essay in The New York Times this past summer suggested that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/movies/white-chicks-anniversary.html" title="">time had been kind to the film</a>, hailing it as “a culturally, racially and sexually savvy tale” whose “spiky critique of white privilege has revealed itself to be far more incisive than its lowbrow humor would indicate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Sunday, the comedy somehow became a part of a National Football League game.</p><p>After an interception by the Minnesota Vikings against the Atlanta Falcons, two players, Josh Metellus and Camryn Bynum, performed a celebratory dance. Aficionados of decades-old gender and race bending comedies recognized it as the one performed by the Wayans brothers at a dance-off in “White Chicks.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Perhaps inspired by the innovative dance, the Vikings won the game, 42-21. Bynum was proud of the celebration, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDVYJVdPT71/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posting on Instagram</a>: “Best celly’s in the league.”</p><p>In 2017 the N.F.L., which had once been so strict that it became known to fans and the news media as the “No Fun League,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/sports/football/nfl-rules-changes-celebrations-overtime.html" title="">relaxed its rules</a> by allowing more elaborate celebrations. Since then players have become increasingly creative.</p><p>Earlier this season, the same two Vikings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sShxgxgSy_8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">performed a dance</a> from the 1998 remake of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/movies/film-review-sisters-sisters-so-cute-and-so-well-dressed.html" title="">“The Parent Trap,”</a> starring Lindsay Lohan, in which a simple handshake turns into an elaborately choreographed routine.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victor-mather">More about Victor Mather</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the World of Sports</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping professional, collegiate and amateur athletics.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Season in the Spotlight: </strong>The San Jose State women’s volleyball team, which has a transgender player, lost its conference championship game, bringing a close to a season <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/transgender-san-jose-state-volleyball.html">upended by an issue that transcends sports</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vote on New 76ers Arena: </strong>The mayor of Philadelphia and labor unions say the $1.3 billion basketball arena would be an economic boost. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/philadelphia-76ers-arena-chinatown.html">But the city acknowledges that Chinatown could be at risk</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Club World Cup:</strong> FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, has tied his legacy to the 32-team tournament that will be held in the United States next summer, even inscribing his name on the trophy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/gianni-infantino-club-world-cup.html">Its success is far from guaranteed</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Enhanced’ Olympics?: </strong>With a controversial plan to allow doping in a major athletic competition, the venture capitalist Aron D’Souza hopes to usher in an era of “superhumans.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/style/enhanced-games.html">There are several hurdles left to clear</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What Coaching My Son Taught Me: </strong>After decades reporting on soccer, three months helping to coach a team of children under age 7 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/europe/rory-smith-soccer-coaching.html">came as a revelation to Rory Smith</a>, a global sports correspondent for The Times.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
