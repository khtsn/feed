A home belonging to Mr. Raad’s family in southern Lebanon was also destroyed in Israeli strikes.</p><p>For the Lebanese, the latest crisis has meant dealing with another painful episode in their nation’s history.</p><p>Lebanon’s economy blossomed after the civil war because of remittances from overseas Lebanese and investment from Arab nations. Then, a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 caused immense displacement and damage that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/16/world/middleeast/16hezbollah.html" title="">repaired with billions</a> in aid and loans from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/world/africa/01iht-towns.2990010.html" title="">Gulf States and Iran</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But endemic corruption, economic crises, the Beirut explosion and the collapse of the government reversed those gains.
