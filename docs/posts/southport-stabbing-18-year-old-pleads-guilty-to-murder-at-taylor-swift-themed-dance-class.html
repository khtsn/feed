The Prevent program did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday afternoon that there were “grave questions to answer as to how the state failed in its ultimate duty to protect these young girls.”</p><p>“Britain will rightly demand answers. And we will leave no stone unturned in that pursuit,” he said in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-statement-on-southport-20-january-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement.</a> “At the center of this horrific event, there is still a family and community grief that is raw; a pain that not even justice can ever truly heal.”</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Rudakubana, who had initially pleaded not guilty, appeared in court, sitting at the back of the room in the defense dock and wearing a gray sweatsuit. He repeatedly refused requests from the court to identify himself or to speak at a volume that the judge could hear.</p><p>The BBC reported that Mr. Rudakubana, whose mouth was covered with a surgical mask, uttered a mumbled “guilty” as each count in the indictment against him was read out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His defense lawyer, Stanley Reiz, confirmed that the defendant understood the proceedings and had pleaded guilty to all of the charges against him. His admission of guilt came as the court was preparing to hear days of evidence about the harrowing attack last summer.</p><p>Now, the case will move swiftly to sentencing, according to presiding Judge Julian Goose, who ordered that Mr. Rudakubana be sentenced on Thursday.</p><p>“You will understand it is inevitable the sentence to be imposed upon you will mean a life sentence equivalent,” he told Mr. Rudakubana after the guilty pleas.</p><p>Judge Goose said he “extends his apologies” to the families of the victims, as none were in court on Monday, because the initial evidence in the trial was not expected to be heard until later in the week. But he said that those families would be in the courtroom on Thursday.</p><p>Ursula Doyle, the deputy chief crown prosecutor for the Mersey-Cheshire region, said in a statement that the “unspeakable attack” had “left an enduring mark on our community and the nation for its savagery and senselessness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It is clear that this was a young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence,” she said, adding that Mr. Rudakubana had shown no sign of remorse. “The prosecution was determined to prove his guilt and I am deeply grateful that today’s plea has spared the families at the heart of this case the pain of having to relive their ordeal through a trial.”</p><p>The authorities have not declared the stabbing attack an act of terrorism. Serena Kennedy, the chief constable of the Merseyside Police, which oversees policing in the region, <a href="https://www.merseyside.police.uk/news/merseyside/news/2024/october/statement-from-chief-constable-serena-kennedy-and-partners-following-further-charges-for-axel-rudakubana/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> in October that “for a matter to be declared a terrorist incident, motivation would need to be established.” She added, “We would strongly advise caution against anyone speculating as to motivation in this case.”</p><p>Mr. Rudakubana was born in Cardiff, Wales, to parents who were originally from Rwanda. He was living in Banks, a village north of Southport, at the time of the attack.</p><p>After the Southport attack, Britain was convulsed by a series of riots, as disinformation about the attacker’s identity swirled on social media and messaging apps. False claims that the suspect was an undocumented immigrant or newly arrived asylum seeker were amplified by anti-immigration activists and members of the far right.</p><p>Several people, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/europe/neo-nazi-uk-riots-elon-musk.html" title="">including a neo-Nazi</a>, were later found to have helped coordinate outbreaks of violence, which included attacks on mosques and hotels where asylum seekers were staying, and which led to dozens of police officers being injured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Rudakubana was 17 at the time of the attack and, under English court rules, he would usually have retained his anonymity until he turned 18. But a few days after the attack, a judge took the unusual step of releasing his name in an attempt to combat the spread of misinformation.</p><p>Since the riots last summer, hundreds of people have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm23y7l01v8o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charged</a> for their involvement in the violent unrest across the country, and dozens of people have been sentenced to prison time.</p><p>Stephen Castle<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Specia reports on Britain, Ireland and the Ukraine war for The Times.
