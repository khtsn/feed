    <h1>What Sonic Detectives Listen for When Rockets Launch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Rocket launches are loud, and big rockets are louder. Launches used to be occasional spectacles, and not many people minded the noise.</p><p>But the pace has quickened. SpaceX, the rocket company started by Elon Musk, now sends a Falcon 9 rocket to space <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/science/spacex-launch-mission-control.html" title="">at least once every few days</a> from launchpads in Florida and California. Other companies, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/science/bezos-blue-origin-launch.html" title="">Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin</a>, also have ambitions to send rockets to space at an accelerating pace.</p><p>And the noise is no longer just the roar of the rockets heading upward, but also the sonic booms of rocket boosters returning to Earth.</p><p>That noise shakes windows and foundations and wakens sleeping people. How the sound waves travel — shifted by wind, bending and reflecting off layers of the atmosphere and the ground below — is complex. Rules and limits that were designed for airports and rock concerts may not suffice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“There is a gap in the science,” said Kent Gee, a professor of physics and astronomy at Brigham Young University in Utah who is one of the few scientists studying the sounds of spaceflight. “We don’t know what people actually find acceptable.”</p><p>And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/science/starship-spacex-explosion-elon-musk.html" title="">SpaceX is testing Starship</a>, the largest and likely the loudest rocket ever. To fulfill his dreams of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/30/science/mars-landing-trump.html" title="">sending people to Mars one day</a>, Mr. Musk envisions a steady parade of Starships launching from sites in Texas and Florida.</p><p>The best time to address rocket noise is before problems become pervasive and entrenched, Dr. Gee said. He is not calling for an end to launches, but says data could point to how to lessen disruptions.</p><p>“If we wait 10 years, it’s too late,” he said.</p><h3 id="link-7e15bfb3"><span>Boom Buh-Boom</span></h3><p>As an undergraduate at Brigham Young, Dr. Gee liked physics and music, so the field of acoustics, and noise in particular, intrigued him. For his Ph.D. at Pennsylvania State University, he studied noise propagation from F-22 stealth fighters. He then returned to B.Y.U. as a physics professor and started working on rockets.</p><p>In recent years, Dr. Gee and his team have mostly studied SpaceX’s rockets because the company’s Falcon 9 launches far more frequently than any other rocket.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>One of the questions they have studied is why a Falcon 9 booster falling back to Earth at supersonic speeds generates a three-part sonic boom. Instead of the “boom-boom” made by a supersonic jet, spectators hear a “boom buh-boom.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dr. Gee’s team has also found that not every launch sounds the same, not even when it is the same type of rocket launching from the same location.</p><p>Falcon 9s lifting off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, for instance, sometimes generate sonic booms heard about 100 miles away. The most recent defense policy legislation, signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in December, acknowledges the disturbances and calls on the Department of Defense to minimize them.</p><p>At a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America this month in New Orleans, Makayle Kellison, a member of Dr. Gee’s team, reported that the uneven topography around the Vandenberg site seems to focus sound waves into certain areas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And the corridor where the booms were loudest changed between summer and winter.</p><p>“During winter, we’re finding that it shifts up closer to Santa Barbara,” Dr. Gee said. Vandenberg has conducted rocket noise studies for years, and in 2024, it added Dr. Gee’s measurements there after complaints about the sonic booms.</p><p>Dr. Gee and his team have also listened to the noises of other rockets, including the small Alpha rocket from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/science/blue-ghost-moon-science.html" title="">Firefly Aerospace</a>, the first launch of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/science/nasa-launch-artemis-1.html" title="">NASA’s giant Space Launch System rocket</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/science/delta-iv-heavy-rocket-final-launch.html" title="">last flight of the Delta IV Heavy</a> from United Launch Alliance and U.L.A.’s soon-to-be retired <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/science/amazon-kuiper-launch-ula.html" title="">Atlas V</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-9"><div><figcaption><span>Clockwise from top left: Starship&#39;s fifth test flight in October 2024; a returning Super Heavy booster during a test flight in March; debris from an exploded Starship seen over the Bahamas from the same test flight; exhaust from earlier in that launch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kaylee Greenlee Beal/Reuters; Eric Gay/Associated Press; Joe Skipper/Reuters; @Genedoctorb/X, via Reuters</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The S.L.S. rocket and the Delta IV Heavy were loud, but not as loud as would be expected given the magnitudes of their thrust. That data could give insights for designing quieter rockets in the future, similar to how jetliners today are not nearly as loud as those flying decades ago.</p><p>Indeed, the S.L.S. launch was almost soundless for one team of observers about 20 miles west of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Yet the roar was heard at another recording station farther away in the same direction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Dr. Gee suspects weather conditions in the atmosphere played a role.</p><p>The researchers have also debunked a science fairy tale, that loud vibrations from the Saturn V, the rocket that took NASA astronauts to the moon, melted concrete and set grass on fire more than a mile away.</p><p>The researchers calculated that it generated 203 decibels. That shock wave would have heated the air by about 40 degrees Fahrenheit — not nearly hot enough to melt concrete or ignite grass.</p><p>Then there is Starship.</p><p>This month, SpaceX received approval to launch the behemoth rocket 25 times a year from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/05/us/elon-musk-starbase-texas.html" title="">its Starbase site in Texas</a>, up from five. The company is seeking even more Starship launches from Florida.</p><p>The city of Cape Canaveral <a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2025/05/23/cape-canaveral-rocket-launch-study-to-measure-noise-vibration-levels-before-spacex-starship-arrives/83648844007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last month hired scientists</a> from the Florida Institute of Technology to monitor sound levels, vibrations and air quality changes for every launch in Florida for at least a year. That will provide a base line for comparisons with Starship in the future.</p><p>The ninth test flight of Starship is to occur as early as Tuesday evening. Dr. Gee and colleagues are already in South Texas, setting up their recording stations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/multimedia/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/multimedia/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/multimedia/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Spectators, many holding cameras or binoculars, watching Starship’s fifth launch from South Padre Island last November." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/multimedia/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/multimedia/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/multimedia/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/multimedia/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp/00HS-rocket-noise-01-zfkp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ce353ae0-3215-5c91-b21b-ebf485135403" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When the scientists compared the fifth and sixth test flights of Starship, they found the earlier one to have been louder.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gabriel V Cardenas/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The last time they were there was in November, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/science/spacex-launch-starship.html" title="">the sixth test flight</a>.</p><p>Their equipment, deployed at 21 sites around Starbase, is unimpressive in appearance. A microphone on a stand low to the ground inside a cylinder of black foam to block wind noise, all sitting on a white disk. Everything else — the digital recorder, a GPS receiver, and a battery to power everything for a few hours — sits within a metal suitcase.</p><p>The microphones have to capture a swath of frequencies wider than what humans can hear, including low-frequency rumbles that are not so much heard as felt. They also have to accurately record volumes ranging from the almost inaudible to the loudest roars. The data is gathered at a rate of more than 100,000 times a second. That’s about 60 times faster than what the human ear can accomplish.</p><p>“It’s hard to record a rocket accurately,” said Grant Hart, a B.Y.U. physicist who teamed up with Dr. Gee a few years ago.</p><p>On the morning of the Starship launch, Dr. Hart and Mark Anderson, a doctoral student, set up recording stations on South Padre Island, to the north of Starbase.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Other microphones had been deployed within a mile of the launchpad, in the nearby town of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/us/spacex-rocket-dust-texas.html" title="">Port Isabel</a>, on the beach to the east of the launchpad — the B.Y.U. team had spent much of the previous evening dodging waves of the incoming tide — and to the west in Brownsville.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Anderson and Grant Hart setting up the equipment to measure the sounds of the sixth Starship test flight last November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenneth Chang</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The researchers were looking to understand how sound varied with distance and direction. “We’re just here to get the physics right,” Mr. Anderson said.</p><p>The recordings do not sound very impressive unless one listens to them through high-end headphones or a music system that includes a large subwoofer to generate the low-frequency thumping. Even then, they cannot reproduce the full-body experience of watching a launch in person.</p><p>A trip to record the fifth test flight of Starship, which took place a month earlier, was financed by B.Y.U., to offer its undergraduates the chance to take part in hands-on research, and a private organization, which remains anonymous. The researchers said it was not SpaceX, a competitor of SpaceX or a politically motivated critic of Mr. Musk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>During that October test flight, Starship’s Super Heavy booster stage <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/13/science/spacex-starship-launch" title="">successfully returned to the launchpad</a>, where it was caught in midair by two large mechanical arms. As it fell back down, it generated a sonic boom and a second wave of data for the B.Y.U. scientists.</p><p>The research money was stretched to repeat the recording effort in November for the sixth test flight. Mr. Anderson and Dr. Hart watched from a parking lot about 10 miles from the launchpad. Dunes blocked a direct view of the liftoff, and the sound was not overly loud.</p><p>Disappointingly, the booster was diverted to the Gulf of Mexico. The sonic boom, more distant, was a muted thump.</p><p>“I wonder what our mics recorded at different locations, though,” Mr. Anderson said. “Did you feel how low-frequency the boom was? You could still feel it. But I imagine there’s going to be no noise complaints about the boom.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p><h3 id="link-21217eea"><span>Shock Waves and Car Alarms</span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A colorized composite image released by NASA in 2019 showing two T-38 aircraft flying in formation at supersonic speeds producing shock waves that are typically heard on the ground as a sonic boom.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>The next morning over breakfast, Dr. Gee’s team exchanged observations.</p><p>“It was much louder last time, and I felt like I could hear the noise for longer last time,” said Noah Pulsipher, an undergraduate student, who observed the fifth and sixth Starship launches from the same place, a park in Port Isabel, six miles from the launchpad.</p><p>This launch was louder for Ms. Kellison, who was watching from the roof of a hotel on South Padre Island, a few miles to the east of Mr. Pulsipher. She reported that the shock wave set off car alarms.</p><p>The team also pondered the crackly pops frequently heard during rocket launches, which sound like sheets of Mylar being crumpled all around.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-27"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>Snap Crackle Pop</h3><p><span>The percussive sounds made by SpaceX’s Starship rocket when it launched in November.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>“It’s different parts of the wave traveling at different speeds that causes these shocks to form, like an explosion,” Dr. Gee said. “They occur at different amplitudes and at different times, and so our ear perceives this as a crackle kind of sound.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>That is because the rocket is so loud that sound speeds up a bit when the vibrations compress and heat the air molecules, then slows down as the air expands and cools.</p><p>For this launch, Dr. Gee, who was at the same park as Mr. Pulsipher, said those sounded more like distinct gunshot-like pops. “It was almost more just individual events,” he said.</p><p>In a paper published using <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jel/article/4/11/113601/3320807/Starship-super-heavy-acoustics-Far-field-noise" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data from the fifth Starship flight</a>, the researchers reported that when the booster returned to the launchpad, it unleashed a sonic boom that, at a distance of a dozen miles, people perceived as 110 decibels.

It produces 11 times the acoustic energy of a Falcon 9 launch.</p><p>“It’s like 11 Falcon 9 launches all happening at the same time,” Dr. Gee said.</p><p>But that is still lower than what is predicted by computer models the Federal Aviation Administration used.</p><p>“If I were SpaceX, I would be questioning the models that are being used,” Dr. Gee said, “because at least by that measure, there is potentially less impact from a single launch than what they’re telling the community.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.</p></div><div><p>Jonathan Corum is a Times reporter and graphics editor focusing on science and health.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
