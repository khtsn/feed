She said the county Health Department had placed certain restrictions on water use at the home, <a href="https://peregrineseniorliving.com/our-communities/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of 11 that Peregrine operates in New York and Maryland</a>, while more tests were conducted. Water filters have been installed on some showers and sinks so that residents can still use bathrooms, she added.</p><p>“There is no threat to the community at large,” Ms. Miller wrote.</p><p>Kristyn Ganim, the home’s executive director, said employees had been working with health officials to address the outbreak. In addition to installing filters across the water treatment system, she said, staff members were providing residents with bottled water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I want to reassure all of our residents, staff and visitors that our community is completely safe,” she said in a statement.</p><p>Legionella bacteria occurs naturally in water, and people typically contract Legionnaires’ disease by inhaling mists or water vapor containing the bacteria, according to the state Health Department. The bacteria can grow in poorly maintained industrial water systems; cooling towers; or heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, according to the <a href="https://www.osha.gov/legionnaires-disease" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a>.</p><p>People 50 and older and those who have compromised immune systems are at particular risk of contracting the disease, according to the state Health Department. Symptoms, which usually begin two to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria, include fever, headaches, muscle aches, coughing and shortness of breath.</p><p>Most cases can be successfully treated with antibiotics, but about one in 10 people who contract the disease die, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/fastfacts.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. About one in four of those who contract it at a health care facility die.</p><p>Mary Rozak, a spokeswoman for the Albany County executive, Daniel McCoy, said that 25 people linked to the <a href="https://profiles.health.ny.gov/acf/view/1254817" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">171-bed home</a> had been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak. Ten tested positive, including the three who died, she said. About nine others tested negative; the rest reported symptoms but were not tested.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Of the three people who died, Ms. Rozak said, two had been hospitalized for treatment of other ailments, and it was unclear whether Legionnaires’ disease had killed them.</p><p>The Legionella bacteria was first discovered through an outbreak connected to an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976. There are about 6,000 documented cases of the disease a year in the United States, according to the safety and health administration, and 200 to 800 in New York, according to <a href="https://www.ny.gov/legionellosis-legionnaires-disease" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the state Health Department</a>. The figures may understate the true number of cases because many infections go undiagnosed or unreported, officials say.</p><p>The number of reported cases of Legionnaires’ disease has been on the rise since the early 2000s and peaked in 2018, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/php/surveillance/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C.D.C. data shows</a>. The number of cases dropped when the COVID-19 pandemic began but began to creep up again in 2021, the data shows.</p><p>There have been several outbreaks in New York City over the past decade, including one that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/12/nyregion/nyc-legionnaires-nursing-home.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">killed five people</a> at a Manhattan nursing home in 2022 and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/nyregion/rikers-inmate-has-legionnaires-disease-officials-find-no-link-to-outbreak.html" title="">another in 2015</a> that caused 16 deaths <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5652421/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and was linked to a cooling tower in the Bronx</a>.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
