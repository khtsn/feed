But recently, its dealerships have been attacked and many owners have sold their vehicles.</p><p>Some buyers who had been drawn to Tesla’s eco-friendly image began losing patience with Mr. Musk after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html" title="">bought Twitter</a>, which he renamed X, in 2022. He alienated many consumers further when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-endorsement.html" title="">publicly backed Donald J. Trump</a> in last year’s presidential election.</p><p>For some, the deal-breaker came when Mr. Musk made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/elon-musk-hand-gesture-speech.html" title="">a gesture</a> that resembled a fascist salute while speaking at a rally celebrating President Trump’s inauguration in January. And with Mr. Trump back in office, Mr. Musk, the world’s richest person, has been empowered to make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/musk-federal-government.html" title="">sweeping cuts</a> to federal agencies and fire government workers, fueling anger against him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s a look at the backlash against Tesla.</p><h2 id="link-780e59f0">Vandals have targeted Tesla dealerships.</h2><p>Vandals have defaced or destroyed Tesla vehicles and damaged the company’s facilities in at least seven locations across the United States, from Oregon to Massachusetts, over the past month. Shots have been fired at a building, dealership windows have been broken and charging stations have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/tesla-charging-stations-arson-boston.html" title="">set on fire</a>. No serious injuries have been reported.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/tesla-vandalism-domestic-terrorism.html" title="">labeled the episodes</a> acts of “domestic terrorism” directed at Mr. Musk, echoing comments by Mr. Trump. If convicted, some of those accused could face sentences of at least five years in prison, Ms. Bondi said, although she did not specify what charges could be brought.</p><p>Protesters across the United States and Europe have also urged Tesla owners to sell their cars, along with shares of the company’s stock. Several hundred protesters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/business/elon-musk-tesla-violence-protests-vandalism.html" title="">recently gathered</a> outside a Tesla showroom in Manhattan, with many chanting, “Nobody voted for Elon Musk.”</p><h2 id="link-f6a24cb">Owners have sold their Teslas.</h2><p>Tesla owners in the United States and overseas have said they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tesla-boycott-elon-musk.html" title="">selling their vehicles</a> because they feel alienated by Mr. Musk’s values and politics. Some drivers said they reached the decision after being harassed for owning a Tesla.</p><p>Senator Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said in a <a href="https://x.com/CaptMarkKelly/status/1900574148906086817" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on X</a> last week that he was selling his Tesla and getting a new vehicle. He later said that he had purchased a Chevrolet Tahoe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I bought a Tesla because it was fast like a rocket ship,” he wrote in the post. “But now every time I drive it, I feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people. So Tesla, you’re fired!”</p><h2 id="link-172fae81">Tesla stocks have plummeted.</h2><p>Tesla’s investors have grown concerned that Mr. Musk is spending too much time in Washington and that his immersion in right-wing politics is alienating buyers.</p><p>As of Tuesday morning, the company’s share price had dropped by 47 percent since Mr. Trump’s second term began. The decline has far outpaced that of the S&amp;P 500 index, which has fallen about 7 percent in the same period.</p><p>Sales are also slumping. Tesla sales in the United States fell by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/business/elon-musk-trump-tesla-conservatives.html" title="">5.6 percent</a> last year, to about 634,000 cars, according to Kelley Blue Book, a vehicle valuation company. It was the first yearly decline in sales in the company’s history.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Powerful A.I.
