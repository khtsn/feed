    <h1>In the Northern Gaza Town of Jabaliya, Some Residents Cannot Heed Israel’s Evacuation Orders</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With Israeli tanks close, shrapnel pinging off the external walls of her home and the booms of airstrikes sounding nearby, Amna Soliman would like to heed a recent Israeli military warning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-north-evacuations.html" title="">to evacuate</a>. But it’s not that simple.</p><p>Ms. Soliman, 42, a former teacher at the American International School of Gaza, said on Tuesday that her neighbors called to warn her more than a week ago that Israeli forces had entered the town of Jabaliya in northern Gaza, which came under heavy bombardment in the early months of the yearlong war. The Israeli military has said it is conducting an operation in the area to prevent Hamas militants from re-establishing a presence there.</p><p>Her neighbors have since fled, but Ms. Soliman, who lives with several other women and a 7-year-old, said she cannot join them because her mother uses a wheelchair and is unable to travel.</p><p>“I simply cannot take her out,” Ms. Soliman said by telephone from her apartment in Jabaliya, which has been shattered by Israeli airstrikes over the past year. “I cannot leave her either,” she added, “So we all stayed.”</p><p>Her dilemma mirrors that of many civilians in northern Gaza, a part of the enclave that is the subject of mounting international concern and rising casualties. It is not clear how many people have obeyed military orders to evacuate north Gaza but around 400,000 people remain, according to U.N. estimates. Some, including the sick and disabled, cannot leave. Some argue that they might face greater danger on the road or at their destination.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Tuesday that thousands of families in the area have been displaced and that those who remain <a href="https://x.com/ICRC/status/1846110068590162293" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are facing</a> “unimaginable fear” as well as the loss of loved ones.</p><p>UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, said on Monday that Israeli tank shells had hit a food distribution center in Jabaliya while people were collecting food. It cited reports that 10 people had been killed. The Israeli military said it was investigating the reports, which could not be verified independently.</p><p>Crews with the Palestinian civil defense, an emergency service in Gaza, retrieved 12 bodies and evacuated three wounded people from sites across Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to Dr. Mohammed Al Moghayer, a spokesman for the organization. The organization said at least 69 people had been killed in northern Gaza since Oct. 5, when the Israeli operation began. The claims could not be independently verified. Israel’s military said it was looking into the report.</p><p>The area has become dangerous for both civilians and rescue workers. The Gaza ministry of health said that a doctor, Ahmed Talab al-Najjar, was killed on Tuesday while trying to evacuate injured people in the al-Falluja neighborhood of Jabaliya.</p><p>In response to Israel’s evacuation order, the Palestinian Red Crescent pulled its staff out of Jabaliya and focused on calls to evacuate the wounded and retrieve bodies. Calls to provide rescue services sometimes go unheeded because of damage to roads and because the Israeli military denies access, Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the organization, said on Tuesday. Israel’s military said it was looking into the report.</p><p>The U.N. human rights office said on Monday that, despite the evacuation order, Israeli forces appeared to be sealing off north Gaza by erecting sand barriers at a key crossing point. The military had also reportedly “opened fire, killing some Palestinians trying to evacuate” farther south, it said.</p><p>Israel’s military said it was investigating the report. On Tuesday, Israel’s military and the government organization that coordinates the country’s policy in Gaza and the West Bank, COGAT, listed a series of measures it had taken to provide medical support and food aid for civilians in northern Gaza.</p><p>Amid the chaos, Ms. Soliman said that Israeli soldiers had telephoned three times with the message to evacuate and each time she told them she could not. She also said that the Red Cross had telephoned to say that it had informed Israel’s military of her presence and her difficulties.</p><p>“We have some canned food and water stored at home,” she said, adding that they are using as little water as possible because they can’t get anymore.</p></div></div>
