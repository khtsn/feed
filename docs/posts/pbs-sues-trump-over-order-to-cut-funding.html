Both organizations pushed back vehemently: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/business/media/npr-trump-lawsuit-executive-order-funding.html" title="">NPR sued to block</a> the executive order this week, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/pbs-paula-kerger-trump-congress.html" title="">Paula Kerger</a>, the chief executive of PBS, called it “blatantly unlawful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The order, PBS says, will “upend public television,” which has aired shows like “Sesame Street,” “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and “Frontline” for decades.</p><p>About 16 percent of PBS’s $373.4 million annual budget comes directly from grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which spends more than $500 million each year on public media. PBS’s lawsuit says that Mr. Trump’s order also jeopardizes the roughly 61 percent of its budget that comes from local station dues, arguing that the White House ban on indirect funding of PBS would apply to local stations.</p><p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting receives its funding from Congress two years in advance to insulate it from short-term political priorities.</p><p>A PBS spokesman said in a statement that the network “reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television’s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.”</p><p>In its lawsuit, PBS argues that Congress — not Mr. Trump — has the power to fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The lawsuit also says that the First Amendment prohibits the president from deciding which organizations should receive funding based on the views they express.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Trump’s executive order is one of several efforts taken by Republicans to weaken public media. The White House has signaled that it will ask Congress to rescind funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and it has attempted to fire members of the corporation’s board of directors. There are also efforts underway in Congress to pass bills that would take away funding for NPR and PBS.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Mullin reports for The Times on the major companies behind news and entertainment.
