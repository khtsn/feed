He also accused the department’s previous leadership of trying to destroy him and declared former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the head of a “crime” family.</p><p>“Scum,” Mr. Trump called his adversaries, in the same room where Attorney General Robert Jackson delivered a tone-setting 1940 speech urging prosecutors be animated by <a href="https://www.roberthjackson.org/speech-and-writing/the-federal-prosecutor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“fair play</a>” rather than a blind drive to win.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If Mr. Trump’s delivery verged on free association, his message was unmistakable: The president intends to bend the vast powers of federal law enforcement to his will — in the pursuit of an anti-crime agenda and, perhaps, vengeance.</p><p>“Unfortunately in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated the trust and good will built up over generations,” Mr. Trump told an audience of supporters and law enforcement officials. “They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.”</p><p>He implored his political appointees at the department not to “be deflected” by critics in enforcing his agenda. He also suggested he was preparing new executive actions to personally target the “violent vicious lawyers” who had prosecuted him or opposed his policies in court.</p><p>“We’re turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals, and we’re restoring fair, equal and impartial justice,” Mr. Trump said, standing at a lectern flanked by signs reading “fighting fentanyl.” Though he repeatedly railed against corruption, his Justice Department recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/eric-adams-indictment-timeline.html" title="">moved to dismiss a case against New York’s mayor</a> and has drafted plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/justice-dept-fraud-corruption.html" title="">shrink an anti-corruption unit</a>.</p><p>As he assailed the investigations into him, Mr. Trump also heaped praise on Aileen M. Cannon, the federal judge in Florida who dismissed the criminal charges against him over the handling of classified documents, calling her “the absolute model of what a judge should be.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The case against me was bullshit,” Mr. Trump said, standing in the building where the charges were approved.</p><p>His appearance in the Justice Department headquarters, while not unheard of, was relatively rare for a president. Several of his recent predecessors have made the trip to deliver remarks or preside over ceremonial events, but none used the perch for aggressively partisan attacks as Mr. Trump did.</p><p>The speech served to punctuate the president’s return to power. Less than two years ago, in June 2023, his legal defense team trudged into the building to be briefed on the details of criminal charges he would face for hoarding classified materials at his house in Florida — the first of his two federal indictments that summer.</p><p>Mr. Trump reflected on those experiences several times and thanked his lawyers for their efforts in getting him off the hook. They had less success in his felony trial in New York, where he was convicted on 34 counts related to hush money paid to a porn actress.</p><p>Mr. Trump eventually returned to the text of his speech, and to the theme of crime-fighting, vowing to crack down on distributors of fentanyl and reduce the number of overdose deaths from the drug by 50 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One of the keys to doing so, he said, was to appeal to the vanity of drug users. “You lose your look,” he said. “Everyone’s vain. They don’t want to lose their look.”</p><p>His digressive style gradually dampened the enthusiasm of many in the friendly crowd, who began scrolling their phones, particularly during his meandering description of the college basketball coach Bobby Knight. But they perked up when he reverted to bombast.</p><p>Mr. Trump accused judges who have ruled against him of being “corrupt,” even as he chastised critics of Ms. Cannon and her rulings in his favor, saying they sought undue influence. And he threatened to punish Biden administration officials who were responsible for the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and those he falsely accused of rigging the 2020 election.</p><p>“These are people that are bad people, really bad people,” he said.</p><p>During his first several weeks in power, Mr. Trump and his appointees have torn down many of the barriers that have long existed between the White House and the Justice Department to prevent political interference in the application of justice — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/justice-department-mel-gibson.html" title="">forced out</a> those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/trump-justice-dept-ousters.html" title="">standing in the way</a>.</p><p>As a general rule, presidents are wary of injecting politics into the agency’s work. But Mr. Trump, who was twice indicted by the department, views it as the center of “deep state” resistance to him. For a man who long ago dispensed with the notion of an independent Justice Department, the visit was as much an expression of conquest and vindication as it was a venue for a policy-focused speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Is it appropriate that I do it?” Mr. Trump mused, as he recounted his decision to deliver a speech inside the Justice Department.</p><p>“And then I realized, it’s not only appropriate, I think it’s really important,” he added.</p><p>The event had many trappings of a Trump campaign rally, including the music, even if set against the backdrop of the department’s marble-clad inner sanctum. The setting was part of an effort to emphasize the power of the institution Mr. Trump controls through loyal appointees.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s first two warm-up speakers, Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, and Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, offered a cheerful and cherry-picked recitation of the department’s accomplishments under Mr. Trump thus far — the acceleration of immigration enforcement, efforts to punish academic institutions that do not bow to the administration’s demand to purge diversity and inclusion programs, and intensifying efforts to fight fentanyl trafficking.</p><p>Mr. Blanche, a former federal prosecutor who served as the lead attorney in Mr. Trump’s two federal criminal cases, began by expressing his commitment to upholding the best traditions of the department. But he quickly shifted gears to profess personal loyalty to the president — something that none of his predecessors in the Biden administration ever did.</p><p>Mr. Trump, he said, “is a complete inspiration to me.”</p><p>Pam Bondi, the attorney general, echoed Mr. Blanche, calling Mr. Trump “the greatest president in the history of our country” and saying she works “at the directive of Donald Trump.”</p><p>Her words were another nod to the Trump administration’s aggressive effort to have a Justice Department that does not operate at arm’s length from the White House, but under its direct command.</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Trump and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div><div><p>Tyler Pager is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager">More about Tyler Pager</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>14</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>President Lashes Out at Lawyers and Former Prosecutors<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-justice-department">U.S. Justice Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/pamela-j-bondi">Pamela J Bondi</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Human Smugglers: </strong>A trial in San Antonio is highlighting the perils of human trafficking, while President Trump’s policies make such treacherous avenues to entry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/migrants-smugglers-trial.html">potentially more profitable to smugglers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> German Tourists Detained for Weeks: </strong>Amid President Trump’s border crackdown, German news media have closely followed the treatment of two tourists who say they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/europe/german-tourists-detained-deported.html">tried to enter the United States legally</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> A Chill Sets In: </strong>Fearing roundups, many immigrants are staying home.
