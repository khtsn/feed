Since the 1970s, <a href="https://ekinchiu.wixsite.com/rochistory/post/diplomatic-relations-over-the-years-quantity" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dozens of countries</a> have shifted ties to China. Beijing claims the self-governed island of Taiwan as its territory, and insists that governments end diplomatic relations with Taipei if they want full relations with China.</p><p>Mr. Lai’s weeklong trip comes as his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/asia/taiwan-trump-us-support.html" title="">government tries to fathom</a> what changes President-elect Donald J. Trump will bring to U.S. dealings with Taiwan, and with China. Mr. Trump has called for Taiwan to sharply increase its military spending and has complained about Taiwan’s global dominance in making semiconductors. But Mr. Trump’s proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-rubio-secretary-of-state.html" title="">cabinet includes Republicans</a> who have been deeply distrustful of China and sympathetic to Taiwan.</p><p>In uncertain times, experts say, Taiwan needs every edge of international advantage that it can get, including from its small allies in the Pacific. Their total population is about 67,000, according to <a href="https://data.who.int/countries/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations estimates</a>, compared with Taiwan’s more than <a href="https://eng.stat.gov.tw/Point.aspx?sid=t.9&amp;n=4208&amp;sms=11713" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">23 million people</a>. But they are members of the United Nations and its bodies, while Taiwan is generally excluded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The advantage that Taiwan gets from showing good will to these diplomatic partners is that naturally they help us speak out internationally, in all kinds of international settings where Taiwan can’t do it,” said <a href="https://ips.nsysu.edu.tw/people/faculty/ianchen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ian Tsung-yen Chen</a>, a professor who specializes in Asia-Pacific relations at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A television broadcasts news about U.S. presidential election in November at a local food shop in Taipei, Taiwan.

In the coming days, China may, if precedent is a guide, display its anger over Mr. Lai’s trip by piling invective on him, and Taiwanese security officials have said they expect Beijing to also stage increased military activities around the island, including coast guard maneuvers.</p><p>China says that Taiwanese leaders’ stopovers on American soil <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202304/04/WS642be302a31057c47ebb857d.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">violate Washington diplomatic</a> understandings with Beijing; U.S. <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12371/6#:~:text=Taiwan%20President%20Tsai%20Ing%2Dwen,Kevin%20McCarthy%20and%20other%20Members." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officials say</a> the transit visits are a courtesy for Taiwan’s leaders. Taiwanese leaders have used their brief stops to promote stronger ties with the United States, which, even without full diplomatic relations, remains their most important partner — a vital market for Taiwan’s goods and a supplier of most of its military weapons.</p><p>This time, Mr. Lai will not set foot in the continental United States, reducing opportunities for high-profile meetings. Beijing’s reaction may also be relatively muted as Chinese leaders focus on preparing for the second Trump administration. More attention may fall on Mr. Lai’s efforts to preserve Taiwan’s diplomatic footprint, especially in the Pacific.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Faced with global challenges, “Taiwan must actively engage with the world,” Mr. Lai told an audience in Taipei shortly before boarding his plane for the trip — his first abroad since becoming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/19/world/asia/taiwan-president-china-us.html" title="">president in May</a>. The three Pacific allies, he added, were “supporting Taiwan’s participation in many international forums.”</p><p>Mr. Lai is likely to be especially eager to make sure that the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau speak up for Taiwan in the Pacific Islands Forum, the region’s main diplomatic gathering, said <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/mihai-sora" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mihai Sora</a>, the director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Sydney. The Forum is one of the few multilateral venues where Taiwan has a steady presence — as a “<a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2024/09/02/2003823134" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">development partner</a>” — to the consternation of diplomats from China, which also has a role in the dialogue.</p><p>When leaders met for the Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga this year, a Chinese official <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/30/pacific-islands-forum-communique-taken-down-after-chinese-envoy-calls-taiwan-reference-unacceptable" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denounced a draft communiqué</a> that confirmed Taiwan’s status, the Guardian reported. But the Solomon Islands, which has had strong ties with China, may <a href="https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/resisting-china-s-relentless-pressure-taiwan-girds-itself-for-2025-pacific-islands-forum-meeting" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">try to diminish Taiwan’s role</a> when it hosts the leaders meeting next year.

Taiwan, Mr. Liu wrote, would “work closely” with its diplomatic allies and partners “to firmly defend our rights and interests in participating” in the forum.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Over the past decade, China has used generous offers of aid and investment to draw away Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic partners, partly in an effort to stifle Taiwan’s global standing and also as retaliation against successive governments led by the Democratic Progressive Party. The party rejects the idea that Taiwan is a part of China and says the island is, for practical purposes, independent and should stay that way.</p><p>Days after Mr. Lai won Taiwan’s presidential election in January, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/world/asia/taiwan-nauru-china-election.html" title="">China announced that</a> it had persuaded Nauru, a speck in the Pacific Ocean, to shift diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing. In 2019, two Pacific Island states — Kiribati and the Solomon Islands — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/world/asia/taiwan-kiribati-china.html" title="">switched to Beijing</a>. This week, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, hosted Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, the prime minister of Samoa, in Beijing, presenting China as a <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/27/WS67458113a310f1265a1cfad0.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">firm friend to the Pacific Island nations.</a></p><p>People on the Pacific Islands, threatened by rising seas caused by global warming, have learned to cope with geopolitical rivalries spilling into their region, said Sione Tekiteki, a former official at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat who now lectures at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand.</p><p>“The problem, I would say, is the fact that, rather than trying to deal with the issues themselves, they work through their affiliated Pacific nations, which in turns creates tensions among those Pacific nations,” Mr. Tekiteki said of China and Taiwan. “It’s only a big issue for us because everyone else talks about it and pulls in Pacific nations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers raising the Taiwanese flag at Liberty Square in Taipei on Friday.

The drop appeared to reflect how, when Taiwan’s diplomatic partners in the Pacific switch to Beijing, they no longer take Taiwanese aid. China was the second-biggest donor, some distance behind Australia.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies in the Pacific all have strong ties with the United States or Australia, and that may discourage them from shifting ties to Beijing, Mr. Sora of the Lowy Institute said. The Marshall Islands and Palau receive U.S. economic support and other benefits through what are called “<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12194" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Compacts of Free Association</a>,” and Tuvalu last year signed a <a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/tuvalu/australia-tuvalu-falepili-union" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wide-ranging agreement</a> with Australia.</p><p>“It’s an important element in terms of adding ballast to these three countries’ current diplomatic ties with Taiwan,” Mr. Sora said. “Those countries might not feel pressed or compelled to look for new diplomatic partnerships.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-buckley">More about Chris Buckley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Amy Chang Chien is a reporter and researcher for The Times in Taipei, covering Taiwan and China.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amy-chang-chien">More about Amy Chang Chien</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/lai-ching-te">Lai Ching-te</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/democratic-progressive-party-taiwan">Democratic Progressive Party (Taiwan)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Delayed Warning: </strong>Weeks after Spain’s deadly floods, residents are mourning the dead and clearing mud from their homes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/world/europe/spain-valencia-flood-alert-warning.html">Many wonder why it took the authorities hours to warn them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Faking a Conversion: </strong>After being abducted by an offshoot of Boko Haram in Nigeria six years ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/world/africa/she-faked-a-religious-conversion-to-escape-terrorists.html">a Christian nurse pretended to convert to Islam to escape</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lebanon’s Unlikely National Hero: </strong>Middle East Airlines, a Lebanese carrier, has managed to fly through wars since the 1960s. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/middleeast/middle-east-airlines-lebanon.html">And it is still in the skies today</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bathing in Oil at a Climate Summit: </strong>In Azerbaijan, site of COP29 and a petrostate, people aren’t only proud of their oil. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/europe/cop29-azerbaijan-oil-baths.html">They visit resorts to soak in it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Scandinavian Band That’s Big in Asia: </strong>Michael Learns to Rock hoped for success west of their native Denmark.
