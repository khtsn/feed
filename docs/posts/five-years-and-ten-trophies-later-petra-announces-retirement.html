		Stoker</span> has <a href="https://x.com/G2VALORANT/status/1998029912196645003?s=20" target="_blank">announced</a> her retirement from Esports, ending a playing career that spanned 13 years, including eight in CS:GO and five in Valorant.</p>

<p>She shared that while she was in negotiations with G2 Gozen on a new contract, the two sides were unable to come to an agreement, which ultimately led to her decision to retire.</p>

<p>&#34;I want to say from the bottom of my heart how grateful I am for the support I&#39;ve received throughout all these years,&#34; she <a href="https://x.com/PetraStoker/status/1998029577323520215?s=20" target="_blank">said</a>. &#34;To everyone who believed in me, and especially to my teammates.. thank you. You gave me some of the best memories of my life, both inside and outside the server.&#34;</p>

<p>Petra leaves Valorant having lifted 10 trophies, including the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1092/champions-tour-game-changers-championship-berlin/main-event" target="_blank">2022 Game Changers Championship</a> trophy with G2 Gozen, where she has been since 2021.

</span> core, and has been there since.</p>

<p>Earlier this season, Petra&#39;s playing career looked to arrive at its end sooner than later. G2&#39;s season started with a third-place finish in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/481425/g2-gozen-enters-post-petra-era-with-drewspark-akita" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>, resulting in G2 <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/481425/g2-gozen-enters-post-petra-era-with-drewspark-akita" target="_blank">benching her</a>. The decision to bench the four-year starter came after an insistence to move Petra, a longtime Initiator player, onto the Duelist role, while shifting Duelist player <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20064/vania">
		Vania	</a>
</span> to Controller.</p>

<p>G2 Gozen entered its first stage without Petra in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2481/game-changers-2025-emea-stage-2/group-stage" target="_blank">Stage 2</a>, which began with a 9-0 showing in the group stage. However, G2&#39;s playoff run ended with a fourth-place finish. Petra was moved back to G2&#39;s active roster for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2595/game-changers-2025-emea-stage-3/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 3</a>, which ended with the team lifting the trophy to secure qualification for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2596/game-changers-2025-championship-seoul" target="_blank">GCC Seoul</a>. After an up-and-down year regionally, G2 Gozen ended the season at GCC with its lowest-ever finish in the championship event, at 5th-6th, after securing top-three finishes in all of the past three GCC events.</p>
