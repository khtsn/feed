    <h1>NASA’s Parker Solar Probe Will Attempt the Closest Ever Pass of the Sun’s Surface</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>This Christmas Eve, a vehicle will travel at incomprehensible speed around a celestial object to bring wonder to the people of Earth — and it’s not Santa’s sleigh.</p><p>On Dec. 24 at 6:53 a.m. Eastern time, the Parker Solar Probe, a NASA spacecraft, will pass within 3.8 million miles of the sun’s surface, more than seven times closer than any previous mission has. While surfing across the corona, the sun’s outer atmosphere, Parker will surpass the blistering speed of 430,000 miles per hour, breaking its own record as the fastest object ever made by humans.</p><p>“It’s a voyage of discovery,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “We really are going into the unknown. Nothing has flown through the atmosphere of a star, and no other mission will for a long time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/science/parker-solar-probe-launch.html" title="">Since its launch</a> in 2018, Parker has inched progressively closer to the sun during 21 solar flybys, called perihelions. The mission, a collaboration between NASA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/science/nasa-parker-solar-probe-pictures.html" title="">has revolutionized our understanding</a> of the sun, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasas-parker-solar-probe-spies-newly-discovered-comet-neowise/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spotted comets</a>, snapped captivating pictures and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/science/venus-photos-nasa.html" title="">yielded insights</a> about Venus.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An artist’s concept of the probe on its approach to the sun.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Ben Smith</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first WISPR images of Venus taken in July 2020 during the probe’s third flyby.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA/APL/NRL</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In addition to its scientific haul, Parker has overcome the technical challenges of flying so close to the sun that the probe’s heat shield must contend with temperatures of nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>“We feel comfortable that the mission is doing really well, even way better than we designed it,” said Nour Rawafi, project scientist at the Applied Physics Laboratory. “But it still remains a very high-risk mission. Anything can happen at any time.”</p><p>During previous perihelions, the spacecraft traversed a region called the Alfvén surface, where the solar wind — a stream of particles emitted by the sun — escapes into space. But for its 22nd encounter on Tuesday, Parker will fly hundreds of thousands of miles closer, slipping well into a stellar region that has never been explored.</p><p>Going deeper into that area of the sun’s atmosphere could offer insights into the “interacting waves” that ultimately may contribute to the solar wind’s acceleration out into the solar system, said Adam Szabo, mission scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“We have just barely crossed this Alfvén point in previous encounters,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/24sci-parkersolarprobe-32583-cover/24sci-parkersolarprobe-32583-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/20/24sci-parkersolarprobe-32583-cover/24sci-parkersolarprobe-32583-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/12/20/131390_1_24sci-parkersolarprobe-32583_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The probe’s eighth and ninth encounters with the sun and its coronal streamers, captured by the WISPR instrument in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Naval Research Laboratory</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As a bonus, the sun is currently at its most active state, known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/science/northern-lights-world-photos.html" title="">solar maximum,</a> raising the odds that the probe will witness spectacular pyrotechnics up close. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad37f8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The probe has already braved coronal mass ejections</a>, major blowups that spew the sun’s plasma out into the solar system. The mission team is hoping for stormier solar seas that might illuminate the mechanisms that accelerate the solar wind and heat the sun’s corona.</p><p>“If the sun gives us one of these humongous explosions, like a coronal mass ejection, when Parker Solar Probe is very close to the sun, that would be fantastic,” Dr. Rawafi said.</p><p>The spacecraft will be out of contact until Dec. 27, when Parker is scheduled to send a message back to Earth confirming its health. Assuming all goes well, the probe will transmit observations from the solar frontier over the coming months. Two more perihelions are scheduled for 2025, and Parker has enough fuel for several more years. But it will never venture any closer to the sun.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/24/multimedia/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/24/multimedia/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/24/multimedia/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A labeled view from the WISPR instrument, with the planets visible labeled and pointed out with white arrows." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/24/multimedia/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/24/multimedia/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/24/multimedia/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/24/multimedia/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb/24sci-parkersolarprobe-dip2-01-gqzb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1098w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f22f6a08-8aaf-56bc-a53c-586efa9a0c98" decoding="async" width="600" height="225"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A family portrait of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn captured on June 7, 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Naval Research Laboratory/Guillermo Stenborg and Brendan Gallagher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An unprocessed image from the WISPR instrument of the comet NEOWISE on July 5, 2020, shortly after its closest approach to the sun.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Naval Research Lab/Parker Solar Probe/Brendan Gallagher</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The mission’s close-up with the sun is the culmination of a dream that dates to the dawn of the space age, but progress was thwarted for decades by the complexity of the task. One particular obstacle is the immense energy required to propel a probe toward the sun.</p><p>Many spacecraft use maneuvers called gravity assists, swinging by a planet or moon to increase and decrease speed. But there were unique challenges to executing those orbital interactions for this mission.</p><p>Yanping Guo, the design and navigation manager for the mission at the Applied Physics Laboratory, came up with a solution in 2007: a trajectory punctuated by seven gravity assists from Venus. The mission was greenlit and eventually named after Eugene Parker, the solar physicist who predicted the existence of the solar wind in the 1950s and lived to see the launch of his namesake probe before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/science/space/eugene-n-parker-dead.html" title="">he died</a> in 2022 at the age of 94.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eugene Parker visiting the probe in a clean room of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Ed Whitman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Barring any unforeseen accidents, the spacecraft will seek to reveal new secrets about our star.
