Emanu El in Houston sounded just like Rabbi Josh Fixler’s.</p><p>In the same steady rhythm his congregation had grown used to, the voice delivered a sermon about what it meant to be a neighbor in the age of artificial intelligence. Then, Rabbi Fixler took to the bimah himself.</p><p>“The audio you heard a moment ago may have sounded like my words,” he said. “But they weren’t.”</p><p>The recording was created by what Rabbi Fixler called “Rabbi Bot,” an A.I. chatbot trained on his old sermons. The chatbot, created with the help of a data scientist, wrote the sermon, even delivering it in an A.I. version of his voice. During the rest of the service, Rabbi Fixler intermittently asked Rabbi Bot questions aloud, which it would promptly answer.</p><p>Rabbi Fixler is among a growing number of religious leaders experimenting with A.I. in their work, spurring an industry of faith-based tech companies that offer A.I. tools, from assistants that can do theological research to chatbots that can help write sermons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For centuries, new technologies have changed the ways people worship, from the radio in the 1920s to television sets in the 1950s and the internet in the 1990s. Some proponents of A.I. in religious spaces have gone back even further, comparing A.I.’s potential — and fears of it — to the invention of the printing press in the 15th century.</p><p>Religious leaders have used A.I. to <a href="https://pastors.ai/sermon-translations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">translate their livestreamed sermons</a> into different languages in real time, blasting them out to international audiences. Others have compared chatbots trained on tens of thousands of pages of Scripture to a fleet of newly trained seminary students, able to pull excerpts about certain topics nearly instantaneously.</p><p>But the ethical questions around using generative A.I. for religious tasks have become more complicated as the technology has improved, religious leaders say. While most agree that using A.I. for tasks like research or marketing is acceptable, other uses for the technology, like sermon writing, are seen by some as a step too far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A hand reaches toward a laptop computer." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm/AI-PASTOR-2-01-tvcm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e01898dd-f300-5319-bac2-bb4636cd70e4" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rabbi Oren Hayon with the A.I. program he uses for research at Congregation Emanu El.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Starghill Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Congregation Emanu El is home to the “Rabbi Bot.” </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Starghill Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Jay Cooper, a pastor in Austin, Texas, used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to generate an entire service for his church as an experiment in 2023. He marketed it using posters of robots, and the service drew in some curious new attendees — “gamer types,” Mr. Cooper said — who had never before been to his congregation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The thematic prompt he gave ChatGPT to generate various parts of the service was: “How can we recognize truth in a world where A.I. blurs the truth?” ChatGPT came up with a welcome message, a sermon, a children’s program and even a four-verse song, which was the biggest hit of the bunch, Mr. Cooper said. The song went:</p><blockquote><p><em>As algorithms spin webs of lies</em></p><p><em>We lift our gaze to the endless skies</em></p><p><em>Where Christ’s teachings illuminate our way</em></p><p><em>Dispelling falsehoods with the light of day</em></p></blockquote><p>Mr. Cooper has not since used the technology to help write sermons, preferring to draw instead from his own experiences. But the presence of A.I. in faith-based spaces, he said, poses a larger question: Can God speak through A.I.?</p><p>“That’s a question a lot of Christians online do not like at all because it brings up some fear,” Mr. Cooper said. “It may be for good reason. But I think it’s a worthy question.”</p><p>The impact of A.I. on religion and ethics has been a touch point for Pope Francis on several occasions, though he has not directly addressed using A.I. to help write sermons.</p><p>Our humanity “enables us to look at things with God’s eyes, to see connections, situations, events and to uncover their real meaning,” the pope <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/communications/documents/20240124-messaggio-comunicazioni-sociali.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a message</a> early last year. “Without this kind of wisdom, life becomes bland.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He added, “Such wisdom cannot be sought from machines.”</p><p>Phil EuBank, a pastor at Menlo Church in Menlo Park, Calif., compared A.I. to a “bionic arm” that could supercharge his work.

He recalled being taken aback when Rabbi Bot asked him to include in his A.I. sermon, a one-time experiment, a line about itself.</p><p>“Just as the Torah instructs us to love our neighbors as ourselves,” Rabbi Bot said, “can we also extend this love and empathy to the A.I. entities we create?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rabbi Fixler and Rabbi Hayon at Congregation Emanu El.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Starghill Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Rabbis have historically been early adopters of new technologies, especially for printed books in the 15th century.
