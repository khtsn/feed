Mr. Patterson, 76, has spent more than 40 years here, accumulating an exhaustive collection of photos, paintings and other paraphernalia from his beloved neighborhood.</p><p>There are portraits of gender-bending performers like RuPaul and Lower East Side gangs like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quiles_jose/p/C8lQfRmAxWZ/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Satan’s Sinners Nomads</a>. There are photos and videos about the case of Daniel Rakowitz, who killed his roommate and girlfriend in 1989 and was rumored <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/nyregion/hearing-revisits-east-village-killing-and-dismemberment.html" title="">to have made soup from her body</a> and fed it to the homeless in Tompkins Square Park. (Mr. Rakowitz was found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/23/nyregion/man-acquitted-of-killing-and-boiling-roommate.html" title="">not guilty by reason of insanity</a>, and the cannibalism was never proved.)</p><p>The walls are decorated with graffiti by some of the famed taggers that Mr. Patterson has known over the years and paintings by <a href="https://urban-nation.com/artist/peter-missing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peter Missing</a>, the musician and artist whose emblem of <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/306171-Missing-Foundation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an upside-down martini glass</a> was once ubiquitous in the East Village, carrying its implicit anti-Yuppie message: “The party’s over.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>There’s a thick black binder of empty cocaine and heroin bags that once drew Anthony Bourdain, who visited Mr. Patterson just before his death <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/business/media/anthony-bourdain-dead.html" title="">in June 2018</a>. Mr. Bourdain, a former heroin user, found a bag of a specific type of heroin he’d once tried <a href="https://explorepartsunknown.com/lower-east-side/bourdain-off-the-cuff-lower-east-side/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called “Toilet,”</a> a moment he featured in the finale of his show <a href="https://entertainmentvoice.com/2018/11/11/parts-unknown-series-finale-journeys-into-the-new-york-culture-that-shaped-anthony-bourdain/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Parts Unknown,”</a> quipping, “You knew you were doing something bad when you bought a product called ‘Toilet,’ you know, and shot it in your arm.”</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A binder of empty cocaine and heroin bags collected by Mr. Patterson.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jesse McKinley/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of the baggies in the binder was named “Toilet.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jesse McKinley/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Perhaps most well known, there are videos Mr. Patterson shot of the 1988 riots in Tompkins Square, footage that eventually led to his imprisonment — for defying a court order — and the indictment of six New York City police officers after police clashed violently with a group of protesters.</p><p>Amid all of it is Mr. Patterson himself, a graying Buddha in a worn wingback chair, sitting in an overgrown garden of his own creation, and preaching a sermon of the interconnectedness of all the subcultures he’s inhabited: the worlds of tattoo artists and visual artists, drug dealers and drug users, punks and protesters, Jews and Latinos, squatters and street gangs.</p><p>“What<strong> </strong>all of this is about, in the end, are the overlaps,” said Mr. Patterson, who has the letters “LES” inked on his belly and five Jack Sparrow-style dreads, running from his chin to his hips. “It really is the weaving together of a whole community. And it’s big.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For students of the neighborhood’s — and city’s — history, Mr. Patterson holds a unique place, with admirers who call him “a legend” and “a unicorn.”</p><p>“In another time, Clayton would be mayor of the L.E.S.,” said Lucy Sante, the author of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/style/lowlife-it-s-a-life.html" title="">Low Life</a>,” a definitive history of early New York.</p><p>Now, however, after more than four decades of taking photos (though he rejects the title “photographer,” saying he’s “not trying to be Richard Avedon”) and collecting stuff, Mr. Patterson is in a jam: 161 Essex is falling apart, and its contents are endangered.</p><p>Once a Dominican wedding dress shop, his building needs repairs. Buckets catch water leaking from the roof, and electrical and other wires are taped to the walls. An old oil boiler sometimes seems overmatched by the cold leaking in through the storefront windows, and basic amenities are threadbare: rusted hot plates in a galley kitchen, a wooden sink in the shower, several unkempt toilets.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><figcaption><span>“I was just interested in documenting the neighborhood,” Mr. Patterson said, which included people such as these throughout the years he&#39;s lived on Essex.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Clayton Patterson</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Unlike other local residents displaced by gentrification, Mr. Patterson owns his building and is in no danger of eviction. His plight, rather, is one of time and energy. He has survived prostate cancer, but is not sure how much longer he has.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>“</strong>I’m fading,” he said, adding: “The old body starts to dissolve, you know? I just don’t have the juice I used to have.”</p><p>Mr. Patterson knows he needs to clear out and organize his “archives.” Ideally, this would mean emptying the building and having it redesigned as an open space — a gallery or a research center or some combination thereof. And while he could undoubtedly sell his building and make a large profit, Mr. Patterson does not want to leave, saying the building itself has a “place in our history.”</p><p>But it’s a project he admits is beyond him. “I can’t do it alone,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Patterson said he has tried to find a place to store his possessions while repairs are made, approaching foundations, cultural institutions and even local developers. There have been some promising developments — Mr. Patterson has discussed temporarily moving some of his archive to a space inside a nearby building, <a href="https://essexcrossingnyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Essex Crossing</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Artwork hangs on his walls and every nook is taken up by his life’s work.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Taggart for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But the task is a daunting one, a collection of every conceivable keepsake, crowding corners and running up the walls: piles of papers, racks of clothing, stacks of canvases, boxes of snapshots, walls of video, shelves of books, cabinets of cameras, caches of cassettes, crates of unknown contents and countless bins of miscellany.</p><p>“This place,” he admits, “is chaos.”</p><p>And despite a large coterie of friends and near-daily visitors, his closest ally is unavailable to help: His wife and professional partner for the last half-century, the artist <a href="https://jamesfuentes.com/exhibitions/elsa-rensaa-new-york" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elsa Rensaa</a>, has dementia and lives in a nearby assisted living facility. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Those who have been inside 161 Essex said it holds reams of evidence of the diverse crosscurrents that have swept through the area since the late ’70s, when Mr. Patterson arrived in New York from his native Canada.</p><p>“What’s in that building is as close to a priceless archive of Lower East Side history of the last 40 years as you’re ever going to see,” said John Strausbaugh, the author of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/books/review/the-village-by-john-strausbaugh.html" title="">The Village,</a>” a history of Greenwich Village, as well as of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Offbeats-Lower-East-Side-Portraits/dp/188727698X" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a book of portraits</a> with Mr. Patterson. “A lot of it is about the Lower East Side that has disappeared, and that exists, kind of only, in that one building on Essex Street. And that makes it really, really important.”</p><h2 id="link-5697bd9a">161 Essex Filled Up</h2><p>Mr. Patterson is part of a long line of New York City street photographers, a roster that runs from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/arts/design/jacob-riis-photographs-still-revealing-new-yorks-other-half.html" title="">Jacob Riis</a>, the famed 19th century journalist and reformer, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/arts/music/ricky-powell-dead.html" title="">Ricky Powell</a>, who shot the likes of the Beastie Boys, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Run-DMC. Unlike Mr. Powell, however, Mr. Patterson rarely found famous subjects; rather, he sought to capture ordinary people.</p><p>“That’s the beauty of what Clayton does,” said Crystal Field, the artistic director of the Theater for the New City, the venerable company on First Avenue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Patterson in a photo from 1988.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dith Pran/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>And for his supporters, Mr. Patterson’s predicament is symbolic of the larger changes in the East Village and the Lower East Side, on the southeast flank of Manhattan.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“They will put a plaque one day where Clayton’s archives used to be,” said Phoebe Legere, a painter, filmmaker, composer and writer. “A sentence or two, right? You can just see it. A bronze reduction of his epic life and work. And meanwhile, the actual art, it’s going to be ash in the wind. Unless somebody does something.”</p><p>As Ms. Legere and others suggest, the area has seen a steady disappearance of cherished venues and hangouts, and with them the grit that once defined the neighborhood.

Raised in Calgary, Alberta, Mr. Patterson met Ms. Rensaa in art school, and the couple moved to New York in 1979. In 1982, they found the building and approached 42 different banks, as he tells it, before finally getting a mortgage. (Mr. Patterson will not say what they paid, but the building is his, free and clear.) Mr. Patterson began taking photos of people who passed in front of 161 Essex, sometimes tracking generations of local residents: from children to parents to grandparents.</p><p><strong>“</strong>I was just interested in documenting the neighborhood,” he said. “And this way, they were all coming to me. And my door was the background.”</p><p>But it would be video that eventually led to what is perhaps Mr. Patterson’s most significant journalistic endeavor. On the night of Aug. 6, 1988, hundreds of people had descended on Tompkins Square Park, the major public space in the East Village, to protest a city curfew at the park, where some homeless people had been encamped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Patterson shot video on the night of Aug. 6, 1988, when hundreds of people had descended on Tompkins Square Park, the major public space in the East Village, to protest a city curfew at the park, where some homeless people had been encamped.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ángel Franco/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Police, mounted and on foot, were dispatched to disperse crowds, a plan that devolved into a violent riot, with officers bloodying protesters, some of whom threw bottles and blocked traffic.
