And the families of hostages captured from Israel in the Hamas-led attack that ignited the war have grown increasingly desperate about the plight of their relatives in captivity.</p><p>After all the sticks Israel has wielded, it has decided to find out if carrots can make a difference.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday repeated his vow that Israel would hunt down and punish anyone who hurts a hostage, but he added a new promise: Israel will give a generous reward to anyone who returns a captive, paying $5 million and providing safe passage out of Gaza.</p><p>“I want to say to those who are holding our hostages: Whoever dares to harm our hostages will pay the price.

In particular, the prime minister has set out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">new conditions</a> after months of talks, like insisting that Israel maintain control of a strip of Gaza along the Egyptian border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s comments on Tuesday confirmed Israeli media <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-offering-hostages-captors-millions-of-dollars-safe-passage-from-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports two weeks ago</a> that the government would offer a reward for freed hostages.

But a potential agreement would be based on the basic framework of a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution that quelled hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah previously, and which did not contemplate or address the plight of the hostages in Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu insisted on Tuesday that Hamas would no longer rule Gaza, saying Israel was making progress toward this goal.
