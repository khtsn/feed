Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani was found in that case to have defamed the women as he tried to help Mr. Trump overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, and was ordered to pay the women $148 million.</p><p>Mr. Trump has issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/business/trump-law-firms-lawsuits.html" title="">executive orders targeting other law firms</a> that employ people he sees as hostile to him, and it was unclear how Willkie planned to respond to such an action. </p><p>Two other firms hit with executive orders have agreed to deals with Mr. Trump in exchange for him rescinding or heading off the orders, drawing criticism from those who see them as capitulating to strong-arm tactics by the president. Three other firms that have fought Mr. Trump’s orders in court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/trump-skadden-deal.html" title="">have been quickly granted restraining orders</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The three judges who stepped in to put the orders on hold said that they were alarmed by them and concerned that they were unconstitutional. But Mr. Trump appears undeterred in his campaign to exact retribution from firms he views as enemies. The president has celebrated his effort, saying more firms are lining up to make deals with him.</p><p>The four people briefed on the discussions between the White House and the firm spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a matter that is supposed to remain confidential.</p><p>In January, a week after Mr. Trump was sworn in, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/dealbook/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-corporate-law.html" title="">Wilkie announced that it was hiring Mr. Emhoff</a>. </p><p>In 2023, the firm had hired Tim Heaphy, who served as the chief investigative counsel on the House select committee that examined the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Mr. Heaphy conducted many of the committee’s important interviews and often sat directly behind lawmakers at the panel’s highly publicized hearings.</p><p>While the firm has ties to Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies, it represented Mr. Trump in the 1990s during one of his company’s bankruptcy proceedings. The firm also successfully helped Mr. Trump’s close ally, Thomas Barrack, win acquittal in a federal case in 2022, and it represents X, the social media platform owned by the presidential adviser Elon Musk.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael S.
