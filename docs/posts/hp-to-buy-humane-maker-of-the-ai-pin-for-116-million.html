The Ai Pin will be shut down, Humane said in a message to customers.</p><p>The deal caps a downfall for the high-flying start-up, which heavily promoted the $699 pin with ads, a TED Talk and at Paris Fashion Week with supermodels. Humane raised $240 million in funding from high-profile investors, including Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, and his counterpart at OpenAI, Sam Altman, valuing the company at $850 million before it released a product.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Humane was created by Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, husband-and-wife founders who previously worked at Apple. The pair envisioned a wearable device that people would clip to their clothes and interact with using voice commands and a laser display projected onto their hand. The idea was to cut down on time spent staring at smartphone screens.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri at Humane’s office in San Francisco in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kelsey McClellan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But the Ai Pin, which began shipping to customers last spring, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html" title="">was a flop</a>.</p><p>Reviewers criticized the product, with the A.I. software often giving wrong answers or taking a long time to respond, while the pin’s batteries sometimes overheated. Humane had hoped to sell 100,000 pins in its first year but got only around 10,000 orders. At one point, the company told customers to stop using their charging cases because of the fire risk.</p><p>Last year, Humane hired an investment bank to sell itself, while also seeking new funding. The start-up sought a sale price of more than $1 billion.</p><p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34374173951373-Important-Update-for-Consumer-Ai-Pin-Customers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter</a> posted to Humane’s website said that the pins would no longer work at the end of this month and that customer data would be deleted. “Our business priorities have shifted,” the letter said.</p><p>HP, which sells an estimated 53 million PCs a year, has said it wants to add A.I. capabilities to its laptops to make them more useful. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/technology/microsoft-copilot-ai-pc.html" title="">HP worked with Microsoft</a> to develop a line of A.I. computers called Copilot+ PCs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In its announcement, HP said it would use Humane’s technology to become a more “experience-led company.” Humane’s workers will be part of a new innovation lab called HP IQ, which will focus on “building an intelligent ecosystem across HP’s products and services.” Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno will join the company, as will the majority of the start-up’s employees, a HP spokeswoman said.</p><p>“We are investing and innovating aggressively in new A.I.-powered capabilities and software,” said Enrique Lores, president and chief executive of HP, during a call with analysts in November. “We will focus on delivering a cutting-edge A.I.-powered tech.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erin Griffith covers tech companies, start-ups and the culture of Silicon Valley from San Francisco.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erin-griffith">More about Erin Griffith</a></span></p></div><div><p>Tripp Mickle reports on Apple and Silicon Valley for The Times and is based in San Francisco.
