All eyes are now turning to the annual conference next month where economic policy is set.</p><p><strong>Businesses are already making moves. </strong>Steven Madden, the U.S. shoe company, said on Thursday that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/business/steve-madden-ceo-china.html" title="">cut nearly half of its Chinese production</a> within the next 12 months.
