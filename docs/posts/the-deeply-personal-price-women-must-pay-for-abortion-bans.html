    <h1>The Deeply Personal Price Women Must Pay for Abortion Bans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Palmese was shocked. “If my life isn’t important, what is important?” she said. “Who’s going to take care of my kids if something happens to me?”</p><p>As Americans vote in the coming days, I hope they’ll remember the ordinariness with which women in this country have been stripped of their rights, including the right to life, in just two years. I hope they’ll remember that medical complications with pregnancies occur regularly in the states that have banned abortion, forcing women like Palmese into life-threatening situations.</p><p>In her case, she found the care she needed to save her life in New York, at Northwell’s North Shore University Hospital on Long Island. Dr. Michael Leslie Nimaroff, who treated Palmese, told me it was clear based on medical records shared with him from her doctor at home that Florida had denied Palmese critical care. Dr. Nimaroff seemed to be struggling to come to terms with a political landscape in which doctors are being prevented from saving the lives of their patients.</p><p>“My understanding is I don’t understand it,” he told me. “As a health care provider for women, it’s very hard for us to understand not being able to intervene for the mother’s wellness and safety. It goes against what we’re taught.”</p><p>Palmese declined to say for whom she plans to vote in the presidential election. But she said she plans to vote for a Florida ballot initiative, known as Amendment 4, that would establish a right to abortion in the state before viability. “Yes on Four is my stance on it,” she said. “We need to keep government out of health care.”</p></div></div>
