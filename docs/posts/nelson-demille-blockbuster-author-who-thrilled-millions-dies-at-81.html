He was 81.</p><p>His death, in a Long Island hospital near his home in Garden City, was from complications of esophageal cancer, his son Alex said.</p><p>Mr. DeMille’s writing “brought you into wonderful worlds,” said Sally Richardson, publisher at large for Macmillan, who knew him for decades.</p><p>“His books were fun and literate,” she added, in an interview. “He had a grasp of human nature and a sense of humor, and he got all kinds of people — the down-and-outs and the sophisticates.

It sold for $425,000 (more than $2 million in today’s money), an enormous sum for an unknown author. Sales were brisk, but with The New York Times on strike that summer, it didn’t make its best-seller list.</p><p>Mr. DeMille’s narrators were of a type: world-weary and wisecracking veterans and police officers. His most well-known character was John Corey, a former New York City cop working on contract as an agent for a federal anti-terrorist task force. Corey is fond of cold beer, crude one-liners and meaty, complicated cases. He dislikes yuppies, poseurs and “schmucks from the Feds.”</p><p>“You can hear Nelson’s humor in Corey’s voice,” said Susan Lucci, the soap opera star and an old friend of Mr. DeMille’s (his uncle built her childhood home in Garden City). “His very well-lived voice.”</p><p>Early on, Mr. DeMille had hoped one day to turn his combat experience into “the great American war novel.” But that effort would not appear until 1985, with “Word of Honor,” which imagined <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/william-calley-dead.html" title="">a My Lai-like atrocity</a> and an investigation into its horrors years after the fact.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><a href="https://time.com/archive/6673406/books-bodywatching/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Time magazine praised the</a> novel for its “gunmetal ring of authenticity,” describing it as “‘The Caine Mutiny’ of the ’80s, a long, over-the-shoulder look at a time that grows larger as it recedes from sight.”</p><p>Mr. DeMille, who favored blue blazers and wore a trim beard, delivered a book every two years, writing in longhand on legal pads with a No. 1 pencil. “Writing was never meant to be a two-handed enterprise,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/nyregion/long-island/11Rdemille.html" title="">he told The Times in 2009</a>, “and, besides, this frees up my left arm to hold a cup of coffee or flip through a research book.”</p><p>His book-lined office, which he called Area 51, was filled with the scent of Marlboro cigarettes, black coffee and pencil shavings and overseen by a bust of Julius Caesar — Mr. DeMille was a Roman history buff — variously wearing an assortment of accouterments. (It recently wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the cover of “The Cuban Affair,” his 2017 caper about a down-on-his-luck charter boat captain and combat veteran in Key West, Fla., who’s been hired to find a stash of cash hidden in Cuba.)</p><p>His handwriting, a furious scrawl, “was atrocious,” said Patricia Chichester, his longtime assistant, who gamely typed his manuscripts into a computer.
