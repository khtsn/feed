She began every morning at the bustling diner, serving pecan waffles, hugging customers and reading leftover newspapers to improve her English.</p><p>“Everyone knows Carol,” said Lisa Dry, a Kennett city councilwoman.</p><p>That all ended on April 30, when federal immigration officials summoned Carol, 45, whose legal name is Ming Li Hui, to their office in St. Louis, a three-hour drive from Kennett. Her partner, a Guatemalan immigrant, had voiced suspicion about the sudden call. But “I didn’t want to run,” Ms. Hui said in a jailhouse phone interview. “I just wanted to do the right thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She was arrested and jailed to await deportation.</p><p>Ms. Hui’s detention has forced a rural Missouri county to face the fallout of President Trump’s immigration crackdown, which was supported in theory by many residents in this Trump-loving corner of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-politics-democrats.html" title="">increasingly red</a> America.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Employees in the kitchen of John’s Waffle House where “Bring Carol Home” T-shirts." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/28/multimedia/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq/28nat-missouri-immigrant-cklq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ddd44559-bde4-5b27-a571-044eb0d41930" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John’s Waffle and Pancake House in Kennett, where Ms. Hui worked, held a “Carol Day” fund-raiser that brought in nearly $20,000. “This lady has the biggest heart in the whole world,” the owner said of Ms. Hui.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Hui’s arrest has forced a rural Missouri county where President Trump won 80 percent of the vote to face the reality of an immigration crackdown.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Many are now asking how you can support Carol and also Mr. Trump.</p><p>“I voted for Donald Trump, and so did practically everyone here,” said Vanessa Cowart, a friend of Ms. Hui from church. “But no one voted to deport moms. We were all under the impression we were just getting rid of the gangs, the people who came here in droves.”</p><p>She paused. “This is Carol.”</p><p>Adam Squires, a onetime candidate for mayor of Kennett, saw it differently. He did not bear any ill will for Ms. Hui, he said, but he voted for Mr. Trump, as did 80 percent of voters in Dunklin County, and he was glad to see the deportation campaign reach home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“They vote for Trump, and then they get mad because the stuff starts happening,” he said of his neighbors. “We’ve got to get rid of all the illegals. This is just a start.”</p><p>Ms. Hui said the call she received from immigration authorities ordered her to appear in St. Louis without any explanation. At the office, she said, an immigration officer called her into a secure area and initially told her the authorities would help her get a passport. Then she was told that she was being detained for overstaying a tourist visa that had expired long ago, and that she would be deported.</p><p>Now, as Ms. Hui bounces from county jail to county jail, her name has popped up on prayer lists at local churches in Kennett. Her absence was felt, residents said, when she was not in the baseball stands to watch her younger son pitch, nor at the eighth-grade graduation to see her older son to receive an agricultural science award.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“No one voted to deport moms,” said Vanessa Cowart, a friend of Ms. Hui from church. “We were all under the impression we were just getting rid of the gangs, the people who came here in droves.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Ms. Cowart was her religious sponsor when Ms. Hui converted to Catholicism earlier this year, learning the Gospels from her Chinese Bible. She became a regular at Sunday morning Mass, as was her partner and their three American-born children: a daughter, 7, and two sons, 12 and 14.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Hui was keenly interested in early Christian martyrs, Ms. Cowart said: “She’d smile and say, God will take care of us.”</p><p>According to the government, Ms. Hui does not have a blameless past. In court records, the government said she arrived in the United States from Hong Kong in February 2004, and paid an American citizen $2,000 to enter into a sham marriage with her sometime around 2005. She had hoped the marriage would allow her to get permanent resident status and permit her to travel to Hong Kong to see her dying grandmother and return to the United States afterward, according to court records.</p><p>Her lawyer, Raymond Bolourtchi, said Ms. Hui was young and desperate in those days, and she acknowledged that her actions were wrong. “Not a day goes by that she doesn’t feel remorse,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Hui was never criminally charged for the fake marriage, which ended in divorce in 2009. Court papers indicate that she has no criminal record.</p><p>Nonetheless, she was working, which people who enter as tourists are generally not allowed to do, and her tourist visa had lapsed. Her status in the country became a matter of dispute.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Many people in Kennett expressed outrage that a hardworking mother had spent the past month jailed by immigration authorities.</p><p>Supporters described her as an ideal addition to a rural town where the population is declining and the only hospital has closed.</p><p>“She’s exactly the sort of person you’d want to come to the country,” said Chuck Earnest, a farmer. “I don’t know how this fits into the deportation problem with Trump.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I can’t believe they’re doing this to her,” said Celena Horton, a waitress at a Missouri steakhouse who swapped big tips with Ms. Hui.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Celena Horton, a waitress at a local steak house, said she and Ms. Hui would give each other huge tips when they ate at one another’s restaurants. Ms. Horton said she loved almost everything that Mr. Trump was doing in his second term. Ms. Hui is the reason for the almost.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I can’t believe they’re doing this to her,” Ms. Horton said.</p><p>The sentiment reflects a stirring unease nationally over Mr. Trump’s handling of immigration, his most potent political issue. Though most Americans in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-times-siena-poll-highlights.html" title="">a recent New York Times/Siena College survey</a> said they still supported deporting undocumented immigrants, a majority of respondents disapproved of how Mr. Trump was carrying out his immigration policies.</p><p>In Kennett, some residents said they had implored state and national Republican lawmakers representing the area to intervene to stop Ms. Hui’s deportation, but had gotten mostly cursory responses. Kennett’s own leaders have not officially weighed in.</p><p>Ms. Hui’s church organized a prayer vigil for her and meal deliveries for her family. Her bosses at the waffle house held a “Carol Day” fund-raiser that brought in nearly $20,000. Petitions to bring Ms. Hui home, which have been signed by hundreds of local residents, now sit on every table, next to the jelly packets and ketchup.</p><p>“This lady has the biggest heart in the whole world,” said Liridona Ramadani, whose family runs John’s Waffle and Pancake House. “Democrat, Republican, everybody was there for Carol” on “Carol Day,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Kennett, a small town in Missouri’s boot heel that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, residents marked Memorial Day and pondered whether they supported his immigration crackdown.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>St. Cecilia Catholic Church, where Ms. Hui worshiped, has stood by her with a prayer vigil and meal deliveries for her family.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>When an article about her detention was posted by The Delta Dunklin Democrat, the local newspaper, it was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DeltaDunklinDemocrat/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deluged</a> with 400 reader comments. Most of them expressing sympathy, but not all.</p><p>“If you’re here illegally, expect to be removed,” said one. “This is the consequence of being in a nation with laws,” said another. One commenter simply wrote “Bye.”</p><p>The online debate got so nasty that the owners of the waffle house implored people to keep their political comments to themselves.</p><p>From jail, Ms. Hui expressed surprise that her arrest had galvanized so many people in Kennett.</p><p>Only a few people in town speak Cantonese, she said, so when she settled there she started to go by the English name she had chosen for herself as a girl back in Hong Kong, when it was still under British rule.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>She started a family with her partner, who also works at restaurants around town. (He declined to comment for this article, and his immigration status is not clear.) Ms. Hui bought a house in Kennett, and her front yard is decorated with “Student of the Month” signs.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-25"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An apron belonging to Ming Li Hui, known as Carol, hangs in a back room of the waffle house where she worked before she was detained.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Petitions to bring Carol home to Kennett, Mo., are on every table at the waffle house.

Despite multiple legal setbacks, though, she managed to stay in the United States by getting temporary government permissions known as orders of supervision, according to her lawyer, Mr. Bolourtchi.</p><p>Ms. Hui’s most recent order of supervision was valid through August 2025, records show. But on the day that Ms. Hui was arrested, she was told that the order was being terminated, Mr. Bolourtchi said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment about Ms. Hui’s case.</p><p>Ms. Hui said she had been blindsided by her arrest, which was one of many the Trump administration has been carrying out at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/18/trump-immigration-dragnet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mandatory immigration check-ins.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kennett, where the singer Sheryl Crow was born, has a new local celebrity: Carol, a beloved immigrant who is awaiting deportation.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>She said she spends her days shuffling between her bunk and meals, and waiting for chances to video chat with her children.

Her 14-year-old son was upset that she missed his middle-school graduation. Her daughter told her that one of her school friends offered to adopt Ms. Hui, so she could stay in the country.</p><p>During one call, her children tried to cheer up Ms. Hui by telling her about “Carol Day.” She said she was stunned to learn about the outpouring of support.</p><p>“I didn’t know they loved me,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Healy is a Phoenix-based national correspondent who focuses on the fast-changing politics and climate of the Southwest.
