</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Sounion, its crew evacuated, currently sits in waters patrolled by Houthi vessels. The Houthis have said they will allow a rescue mission, but moving the ship will be precarious.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Here’s what we know about the stuck tanker.</p><h2 id="link-10eb92bc">How did the ship get stuck?</h2><p>The MV Delta Sounion was sailing through the southern Red Sea when it came under attack from vessels controlled by Houthi fighters on Aug. 21, according to the European Union’s naval mission in the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf.</p><p>No crew members were killed or injured, but the ship lost engine power during the attack, the naval mission said on social media. The crew of 23 Filipino and two Russian sailors was evacuated to Djibouti, a country on the Horn of Africa.</p><p>During the rescue, the naval mission’s ship spotted an unmanned vessel nearby, and immediately destroyed it. In <a href="https://nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/middleeast/sailors-us-navy-houthi-attack.html" title="">past attacks</a>, Houthi rebels have used remote-controlled boats that have rushed at vessels, causing explosive collisions.</p><p>The Sounion, flying a Greek flag and managed by the Greek shipping company <a href="https://www.deltatankers.gr/index.html#about-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Delta Tankers</a>, had been traveling from Iraq to Greece, according to a briefing from the Pentagon. Now, it poses a navigational hazard to other ships passing through the area, the Pentagon said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In a <a href="https://www.mfa.gr/en/current-affairs/top-story/minister-of-foreign-affairs-george-gerapetritis-statement-upon-arrival-at-the-informal-meeting-of-eu-foreign-ministers-brussels-29082024.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on Thursday</a>, Greece’s foreign minister, George Gerapetritis, said he had spoken to his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, which has a coast along the Red Sea, “to ensure the safest possible management of this issue.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fires burning on the deck of the MV Delta Sounion.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">EUNAVFOR ASPIDES/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2d2dbe7f">What is the environmental risk?</h2><p>The ship’s cargo contains 150,000 tons of crude oil, or more than a million barrels. What’s worse, the stranded ship has been on fire since Aug. 23, posing an “imminent threat of regional pollution,” the European Union naval mission said.</p><p>On Wednesday, aerial images of the Sounion showed several fires on the deck. While there is no apparent oil leak yet, the Pentagon raised concerns on Tuesday that the stranded vessel represented a “potential environmental catastrophe.” (The U.S. State Department has said the spill of a million barrels of oil would be <a href="https://www.state.gov/houthi-attacks-on-the-sounion-oil-tanker-threaten-becoming-an-environmental-disaster/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four times the size</a> of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska.)</p><p>International naval forces and agencies are working together to determine how to move the nearly 900-foot-long tanker. </p><h2 id="link-73d071b">Why are the Houthis attacking ships?</h2><p>The Houthis are a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/world/middleeast/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">group of Shiite militants</a> who have fought Yemen’s government for more than two decades. With the support of Iran, the group now controls large swathes of northern Yemen and it has become the de facto government in the Gulf country. The U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/world/middleeast/houthis-terror-group.html" title="">designated the group</a> a terrorist organization in February.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In recent years, the group has been targeting vessels traveling in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, a crucial gateway for global shipping through the Suez Canal. After Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza, the Houthis pledged their solidarity to the Palestinian people, stepping up attacks on ships and disrupting international shipping lanes.</p><p>On Wednesday, a Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdulsalam, told <a href="https://iranpress.com/yemen-accepts-rescue-operation-for-damaged-oil-tanker-in-red-sea" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Iranian media</a> that it would allow the retrieval of the Sounion, acquiescing to requests from several countries. Iran’s mission to the United Nations confirmed the decision, adding that the group had consented because of humanitarian and environmental concerns.</p><p>Still, Houthi leaders have vowed to continue their campaign to disrupt shipping lanes, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist organizations.</p><p>“These are simply reckless acts of terrorism which continue to destabilize global and regional commerce, put the lives of innocent civilian mariners at risk, and imperil the vibrant maritime ecosystem in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the Houthis own backyard,” Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said during a news briefing on Tuesday.</p><p>Ephrat Livni<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel covers South Africa and the countries that make up southern Africa from Johannesburg.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/european-union">European Union</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The War That Won’t End:</strong> It’s been nearly a year since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. “The Daily” explains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/podcasts/the-daily/israel-gaza-hamas.html">why the conflict is still going</a>, and what it would take to end it.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Spotlight on Israel’s Bedouins:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/who-is-qaid-farhan-al-qadi-israel-hostage.html">Farhan al-Qadi</a>, the hostage rescued by the Israeli military from Gaza, is a member of the Bedouin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostage-bedouin.html">an Arab community marginalized by Israel</a> that suffered painful losses on Oct. 7.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Nuclear Talks:</strong> Iran’s supreme leader suggested that his country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks-khamenei.html">would pursue nuclear negotiations</a> with the United States, but it was unclear if his comments signaled a shift in relations between the two countries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hamas’s Elusive Leader:</strong> Yahya Sinwar is by far Hamas’s most important figure, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html">his success in evading capture or death</a> has denied Israel a military success that could help end the war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s Orphans:</strong> The war in Gaza is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html">making so many orphans</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-orphans.html"> </a>that no agency or aid group can count them.
