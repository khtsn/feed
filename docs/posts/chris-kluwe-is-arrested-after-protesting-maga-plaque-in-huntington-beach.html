Player Arrested for Protest Against MAGA Plaque</h2><h4>Chris Kluwe, a former N.F.L. punter and a resident of Huntington Beach, Calif., was arrested at a City Council meeting after speaking out against plans to install a plaque with references to President Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Everyone is in favor of a plaque to celebrate the library, but the vast, vast majority are against including a MAGA acrostic. Unfortunately, it’s clear that this council does not listen. So instead, I’m going to take my time to say what MAGA has stood for these past three weeks. MAGA stands for trying to erase trans people from existence. MAGA stands for resegregation and racism. MAGA stands for censorship and book bans. MAGA stands for firing air traffic controllers while planes are crashing. MAGA stands for firing the people overseeing our nuclear arsenal. MAGA stands for firing military veterans and those serving them at the V.A., including canceling research on veteran suicide. MAGA stands for cutting funds to education, including for disabled children. MAGA is profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy and most importantly, MAGA is explicitly a Nazi movement. You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that is what it is. I will now engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience.” “Get the — get out.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/us/politics/20vid-kluwe-huntington-beach-city-council/20vid-kluwe-huntington-beach-city-council-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Chris Kluwe, a former N.F.L. punter and a resident of Huntington Beach, Calif., was arrested at a City Council meeting after speaking out against plans to install a plaque with references to President Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>City of Huntington Beach</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-02-20T12:57:18-05:00"><span>Feb. 20, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>12:57 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When he was an N.F.L. punter with the Minnesota Vikings, Chris Kluwe was known for speaking out. He hasn’t stopped in retirement.</p><p>Mr. Kluwe was arrested in Huntington Beach, Calif., on Tuesday night and charged with disrupting a City Council meeting.</p><p>He was objecting to plans for a plaque celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Huntington Beach Central Library, which included the words “Magical,” “Alluring,” “Galvanizing” and “Adventurous” — the first letters of which spell “MAGA,” President Trump’s slogan meaning “Make America Great Again.”</p><p>The proposed plaque continued with a more explicit reference: “Through hope and change our nation has built back better to the golden era of Making America Great Again!” — also alluding to the “hope and change” and “build back better” slogans popularized by former Presidents Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Kluwe, who said he had lived in Huntington Beach for 15 years, was one of several citizens who rose to speak at the public hearing. “Everyone is in favor of a plaque to celebrate the library, but the vast, vast majority are against including a MAGA acrostic,” he said, standing at a lectern with a microphone. “Unfortunately, it’s clear that this council does not listen.”</p><p>“MAGA is explicitly a Nazi movement,” he said, drawing applause. “You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that is what it is.”</p><p>Saying he would now engage in the “time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience,” he took a few steps toward the front of the room where council members were sitting, and police officers rushed in to detain him. A councilman announced a five-minute recess, and cameras cut away for several moments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20xp-kluwe-sdiu/20xp-kluwe-sdiu-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20xp-kluwe-sdiu/20xp-kluwe-sdiu-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20xp-kluwe-sdiu/20xp-kluwe-sdiu-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Chris Kluwe smiles while speaking at a lectern during a protest.
