The group is also a Shiite Muslim political party, backed by Iran, with an influential role in Lebanon’s faction-ridden political system. It provides social services to a large base of supporters. And its fighters and missiles are hidden among Lebanon’s civilian population.</p><p>“Israel’s war is not with you,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-strikes.html" title="">told the Lebanese people this week</a>. “It’s with Hezbollah.”</p><p>But it’s not always clear where Hezbollah ends and Lebanon begins. The group, which the United States and many other countries consider a terrorist organization, is a dominant political and military power in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The name Hezbollah (pronounced hez-bo-llah) is Arabic for “Party of God.” The group was founded, with help from Iran, to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon that began in 1982 during the country’s civil war. The United States believes that an early incarnation of the group also played a role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. </p><p>As the Lebanese civil war drew to a close in 1990, the group was allowed to keep its weapons as part of the peace deal, even as Lebanon’s other religious sects were forced to disarm. Hezbollah argued that its weapons were necessary to protect Lebanon and the group continued to launch guerrilla attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon until they withdrew in 2000.</p><p>In addition to its military activities, Hezbollah increased its participation in Lebanon’s political system, winning seats in Parliament and holding cabinet positions. </p><p>Its standing increased further after a 2006 war with Israel that was triggered when Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers during a cross border raid. The war ended after 34 days of intense combat with both sides declaring victory. In Lebanon and across the Arab world, Hezbollah were lauded as heroes for taking on Israel.</p><p>With support from Iran and Syria, Hezbollah rebuilt areas that had been damaged during the war. It established schools, set up its own covert communications network and launched a TV station. Former fighters even <a href="https://www.mleeta.com/newmleeta/english/article6.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened a museum</a> celebrating the militia’s reputation as a wily force of resistance against Israel’s powerful military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It continued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/world/israel-gaza-hamas-hezbollah" title="">building its military forces</a>, which are estimated to include tens of thousands of soldiers and more than 100,000 missiles. Hezbollah has perhaps the largest arsenal of any nonstate armed group in the world, according to experts.</p><p>Hezbollah and its coalition allies gained a majority in the 2018 parliamentary elections, but lost it again in 2022. Hezbollah currently holds 13 seats in the 128-member Lebanese Parliament. That may not sound like much, but in Lebanon’s consensus-driven political system, which requires coalition building between religious and political factions, it is enough to wield significant power.</p><p>“They do not control parliament, but they have a lot of influence,” said Paul Salem, the Beirut-based vice president for international engagement at the Middle East Institute in Washington.</p><p>Although Hezbollah’s coalition <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/world/middleeast/lebanon-election-hezbollah.html" title="">lost its majority two years ago</a>, it has effectively maintained the power to block many major decisions. The effect has been gridlock: Lebanon’s Parliament has been unable to name a president for the past two years, and the country is run by a caretaker prime minister with limited powers.</p><p>A United Nations Security Council resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701?useskin=vector" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called for Hezbollah to disarm and barred militants from the border area</a>. But that resolution was never fully enforced, leading to long-simmering tensions and violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Now, with the Lebanese government crippled by deadlock and economic crises, there is no force in Lebanon that can limit Hezbollah’s power. Najib Mikati, the country’s caretaker prime minister, castigated Israel after this week’s bombings without mentioning Hezbollah. </p><p>“The continuing Israeli aggression on Lebanon is a war of extermination in every sense of the word and a destructive plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns,” he said at a cabinet meeting on Monday. </p><p>Despite its dominance in Lebanon, Hezbollah is not as popular in the country as it may seem, said David Wood, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. Many resent the group’s outsize influence and accuse Hezbollah of dragging the whole country into an unnecessary war. </p><p>“It’s undeniable that these operations have weakened Hezbollah militarily,” Mr. Wood said. “What it has done to Hezbollah’s political standing is less clear.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli Strikes in Lebanon</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>As world leaders gathered for the U.N.
