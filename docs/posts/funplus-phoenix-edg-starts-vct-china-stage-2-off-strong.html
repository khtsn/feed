		<p>The first week of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2" target="_blank">VCT China 2025 Stage 2</a> has come and gone, with each team showcasing what they learned from either their time at Masters Toronto or scrimming at home. EDG showcased their new roster, while FPX played one of their best games of the year.</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of how all the games went in week one:</p>



<p>There were both three sweeps and three long series in week one, but not all were alike. EDG made their first appearance with new player <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7135/zjc">
		zjc	</a>
</span> in the roster, and played well against a struggling TEC team looking to turn their season around in Stage 2. Bilibili Gaming came back from Toronto and continued their strong regional form like nothing happened, while Xi Lai Gaming squeaked a 2-1 win over All Gamers in what could have been the biggest upset of the region so far.</p>

<p>FPX was also looking to turn their season around, and despite their first matchup being the Cinderella story from Masters Toronto, it seems these Wolves were scattered by <span data-ref-id="13">

</span> like leaves in the fall. Last but not least, DRG scraped past Nova Esports with their new pickup <span data-ref-id="14">

</span> leading the way, and Trace Esports responded after losing Lotus 13-4 to JDG by pulling the Uno reverse card and finishing Haven 13-4 to start Stage 2 with a win.</p>

<p>As said earlier, Akeman was one of the best players in week one, plus <span data-ref-id="15">

</span> from BLG and Autumn from FPX also stood out in their wins. However, the player of the week for the debut week of Stage 2 has to be <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> from EDG. Dedicated fans of EDG know that nobody is a feast-or-famine IGL in both strats and aim, and he started Stage 2 feasting on TEC. Even with another roster change to manage, his stats included a region-leading 1.52 match rating and 1.95 K:D, while finishing top ten in ACS and KPR. </p>

<p>With these results, BLG is first in Group Alpha by round differential, with EDG just behind. Trace is third and JDG Esports reside in fourth thanks to their amazing Lotus, which raised their round differential above both TEC and TYLOO, in that order.</p>

<p>As for Group Omega, FPX is at the top, as the only team to sweep their match in the group. DRG had a better round differential in their win, ending in second above XLG. All Gamers, like JDG in Group Alpha, had a great map that kept them in fourth place. That places them above Nova and Wolves, in that order.</p>

<p>The eight-match week two for VCT China 2025 Stage 2 consists of:</p>
