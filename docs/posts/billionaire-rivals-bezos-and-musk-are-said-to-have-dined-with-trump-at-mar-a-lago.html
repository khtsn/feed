Mr. Musk was a crucial supporter of Mr. Trump’s bid for the presidency and is helping to lead a government cost-cutting effort for him, and Mr. Bezos’ Amazon said last week it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/amazon-trump-inauguration.html" title="">giving $1 million to the committee planning Mr. Trump’s inauguration</a>.</p><p>Mr. Bezos, who founded both Amazon and Blue Origin and also owns The Washington Post, said at a New York Times DealBook conference this month that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/jeff-bezos-trump-amazon-washington-post.html" title="">optimistic about Mr. Trump’s return to the White House</a> and that he has seen signs of a “calmer” president-elect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump has basked in the glow of those who once criticized him or kept him at a distance rushing to forge relationships with him.
