By Monday, far-right and even some mainstream politicians were calling for the return of some of the nearly one million Syrians who have made Germany home.</p><p>“Many refugees who have found protection in Germany are now finally hopeful of being able to return to their Syrian homeland and rebuild their country,” said Nancy Faeser, the German interior minister, who is responsible for refugees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Several European countries, including Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy and Sweden, swiftly announced that they would temporarily suspend legal proceedings considering asylum status for Syrians. Austria went a step further and announced that it would also prepare to deport Syrians whose claims for asylum fail.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12germany-syria-02-tqvf/12germany-syria-02-tqvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12germany-syria-02-tqvf/12germany-syria-02-tqvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/12germany-syria-02-tqvf/12germany-syria-02-tqvf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Armed fighters in combat gear ride in the back of a pickup.

For now, they added, it was unclear whether Syria would remain as oppressive and as unsafe as before.</p><p>But there was also little disguising the enthusiasm in parts of Europe that Mr. al-Assad’s ouster might help ease Europe’s migration problem by allowing Syrians to return home or by turning new applicants away. </p><p>Jens Spahn, a German health minister under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, alluded to that possibility in a TV interview on Monday. “What if the German government said: ‘We will charter planes for anyone who wants to go back to Syria, and we will give them 1,000 euros to get them started’?” he said, referring to a sum worth about $1,000.</p><p>To the many Syrians who have successfully and painstakingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/28/world/europe/germany-refugee-elected-mayor.html" title="">integrated in European society</a>, such comments were troubling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It was shocking that on the same day that the Assad regime fell, we immediately heard politicians from Germany and all over Europe, talk about when and how the Syrians should go back,” said Anas Aboura, 38, a curator and artistic director in Hamburg who arrived from Syria in 2015 and was granted asylum.</p><p>“No, I’m sorry,” he added, “We are an established community, and we are established here as individuals, and it is up to us to decide when and how to go and help rebuild Syria.”</p><p>No other European nation has welcomed as many Syrian refugees as Germany. As chancellor, Ms. Merkel refused to close the borders in 2015 when nearly a million <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/migrants/march-budapest-hungary" title="">fled to her country</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Families, mostly from Syria, camped underneath a train station in central Budapest in 2015.

As Germany <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/europe/germany-scholz-no-confidence-vote.html" title="">prepares for elections</a> early next year, nearly all parties, including the left-leaning Greens, are in favor of curbs.</p><p>Gerald Knaus, a migration expert who has advised the German government, said that any discussions about sending Syrians established in Europe back home was largely political posturing. In reality, courts would most likely prevent such deportations because many European countries prohibit sending asylum seekers back to dangerous situations.</p><p>“Nobody falls for the idea that you could get someone to move back to Syria just for €1,000,” he said.</p><p>Susan Fratzke, a Germany-based senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, said it was unsurprising that countries would pause decisions on asylum claims given that the situation had changed substantially. Still, given the uncertainty in Syria, any decision to reject providing a form of protection would be premature, she noted.</p><p>Yet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/europe/europe-migration-shift.html?searchResultPosition=16" title="">in much of Europe</a>, countries have adopted or are considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/europe/europe-migration-shift.html" title="">harsher policies</a> than before, and the decisions to suspend Syrian asylum applications are taking place in the context of heated debates over irregular immigration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Yvette Cooper, home secretary for the center-left Labour government in Britain, <a href="https://x.com/ukhomeoffice/status/1866196764128154017" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement posted on social media</a> on Monday that her country would join others in suspending decisions on asylum applications from Syrians.</p><p>“We have seen some people returning to Syria,” Ms. Cooper said. “We also have a very fast-moving situation that we need to closely monitor.”</p><p>“That is why,” she added, “like Germany, like France and like other countries, we have paused asylum decisions on cases from Syria while the Home Office reviews and monitors the current situation.”</p><p>The French national asylum agency said on Monday that it was “closely following” the situation in Syria but stopped short of a blanket suspension of all applications from Syrians. The agency said that requests would be examined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>“As is always the case when the situation in an asylum seeker’s country of origin changes, this may lead to a temporary suspension of decisions on certain asylum applications from Syrian nationals,” the agency <a href="https://www.ofpra.gouv.fr/actualites/communique-de-presse-syrie" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers in Weimar, Germany, in 2016 at a meeting to discuss job opportunities.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mauricio Lima for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On Wednesday, Greece, too, announced that it would be halting asylum claims for Syrians. “We’ve announced a freezing of the whole process,” the country’s migration minister, Nikos Panagiotopoulos, told Greek radio. “Until we see, weigh the facts and see how things develop on the ground.”</p><p>He added: “At the moment, one thing is certain: Asylum can no longer be given to a Syrian citizen when they cite persecution by the Assad regime from the moment that the Assad regime no longer exists.”</p><p>The decisions to suspend asylum applications for Syrians will leave thousands in a legal limbo. At the moment, for example, 9,500 await decisions in Greece, 7,300 in Austria, 6,500 in Britain, and 700 in France.</p><p>But in Germany alone, 47,270 people are on the list.</p><p>Tareq Alaows, 35, fled to Germany in 2015 and now works for Pro Asyl, a nongovernmental organization helping refugees. “I sense great fear and instability in the community because Germany could think of nothing better than to start a debate about a return less than 24 hours after the fall of the regime,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Since arriving, Mr. Alaows has learned to speak near-perfect German. He even ran for Parliament in 2021 as a Green Party candidate though later dropped out. He watched the Assad ouster unfold from Berlin, devouring social media and sharing the news with friends and family.</p><p>He said that the most poignant moment was when he saw video of Syrians tearing down a statue of Mr. al-Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad: He knew it well because it stood just several hundred yards from the house where he grew up in Damascus.</p><p>“When I was born, that statue was there, and I’ve been wanting to remove it my entire life,” he said. “I wished I could have been there with my people for that moment.”</p><p>Germany has its own experience with repressive regimes, he noted, and would do better helping Syrians with the fallout than talking about repatriation.</p><p>“We need support because peace in Syria will only be possible when there is justice,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Celebrating in Berlin on Sunday.
