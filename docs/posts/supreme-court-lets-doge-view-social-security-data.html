Two labor unions and an advocacy group represented by Democracy Forward Foundation sued to block access, saying that much of the information was deeply personal and protected by privacy laws.</p><p>The court responded that the agency “may proceed” to give DOGE access to the records necessary to do its work. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060625zr_5426.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second unsigned order</a> on Friday the court handed DOGE a second victory, ruling that, for now, the organization does not have to turn over internal records to a government watchdog group as part of a public records lawsuit.</p><p>The court’s three liberal members — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — dissented from both rulings.</p><p>Although Mr. Musk left Washington at the end of May after declining influence and increasing friction with both President Trump and shareholders of his own private companies, the two cases are a reminder of what he left behind.</p><p>For the first few months of the Trump administration, Mr. Musk and his team swept through federal agencies, firing federal workers and leaving a flurry of lawsuits in their wake. Mr. Musk’s time in the government, however, failed to deliver on his promised $1 trillion in cuts to the federal budget.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s departure from Washington also signaled the souring of his relationship — at least for the time being — with President Trump, which spilled into the public eye in spectacular fashion in a series of social media posts on Thursday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
