    <h1>What to Know About South Korea President Yoon’s Impeachment Over Martial Law</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="link-1a9d6366">Why was Mr. Yoon impeached?</h2><p>Late on Dec. 3, Mr. Yoon stunned the country when he declared martial law, but it lasted only six hours because lawmakers quickly voted to overturn it. Shortly after he made the announcement on live television, troops stormed the National Assembly building, with military leaders later testifying that they had been sent by the president to prevent lawmakers from being able to vote. Crowds of citizens confronted the troops, and some lawmakers scaled fences to get into the assembly and vote.</p><p>On Friday, Justice Moon said that Mr. Yoon’s martial law decree did not meet the constitutional requirement for a national crisis, which Mr. Yoon repeatedly said was one of the reasons he had made the extraordinary declaration.</p><p>Justice Moon said Mr. Yoon had failed in his duties as the nation’s commander in chief and that his subsequent lifting of martial law did not lessen the degree of gravity. The impeachment case was procedurally sound, he said. Only six of the eight members on the bench needed to vote in favor to uphold the impeachment, but the decision was unanimous.</p><h2 id="link-746c5a3e">What will happen next?</h2><p>Acting president Han Duck-soo will continue in his role until the nation elects a new president through a snap election. This must take place within 60 days from Friday, meaning early June at the latest. The National Election Commission is expected to announce the date in the coming days.</p><p>Political parties will select their candidates through primary elections.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/asia/south-korea-lee-jae-myung-martial-law.html" title="">Lee Jae-myung</a> is the expected front-runner to lead the opposition Democratic Party. He has been Mr. Yoon’s political rival since the last presidential elections in 2022 when he lost to the former president by less than 1 percent of the votes. Mr. Lee has been at the helm of the political push to remove the now-impeached president.</p></div></div>
