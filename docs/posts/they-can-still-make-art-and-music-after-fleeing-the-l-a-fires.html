He lived with his family on a cul-de-sac and worried that if a neighbor’s tree succumbed to the Santa Ana winds and fell across the road, they could be trapped.</p><p>So he and his wife, Carrie Quinn, rushed around in the dark trying to wrangle their two children, two house cats and a few essentials into their Honda Accord. “We didn’t pack a lot of clothes,” Yi said. “At least in my mind, I thought we were coming back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Their 16-year-old daughter, Adeline, wasn’t taking any risks. After putting her pet coral snake in a travel carrier and making sure she had her computer, phone, favorite stuffed dinosaur and a few necklaces, she asked her parents if there was room in the car for something else, something not exactly small — the acoustic bass guitar she had in her room that she’d been practicing on for months.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The instrument wasn’t hers — it had been lent to her by a music teacher at her high school in Pasadena — and she didn’t feel right leaving it behind.</p><p>“It’s not mine,” said Adeline, who goes by Addie. “I would feel kind of bad if I left it in the fire.”</p><p>So they stuck the bass in the trunk with the random assortment of household items. As their terrified cats yowled, they sped away from the flames. Their house, they later learned, didn’t survive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When Addie returned to school, she told her teacher that she rescued the bass. “He said it’s more important that I got out alive,” Addie said. “But he’s probably supposed to say that because he’s a teacher.”</p><p>Recently, the teacher gave Addie a gift: an electric bass with an amp.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-958c0ff">Painting supplies</h2><h3 id="link-46128b63"><span><strong>Nancy Spiller, 71</strong><strong><em> Pacific Palisades</em></strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/24/26catoday-onsite-copy1-39377-cover/26catoday-onsite-copy1-39377-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/24/26catoday-onsite-copy1-39377-cover/26catoday-onsite-copy1-39377-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/02/24/134569_1_26catoday-onsite-copy1-39377_wg_360p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As she evacuated from her Pacific Palisades home, Nancy Spiller thought she would be back in a week when she grabbed clothes, medications and dog food.</p><p>Ms. Spiller, a writer and artist, also tossed in her gouache paints and two jars of paintbrushes, just so she would have something to do while she and her husband waited out the fire in Oxnard, about 60 miles to the west.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I thought, I’ll take this because that’s something that I do,” she said. “I will be painting while we wait out the end of all of this.”</p><p>The fire, it turned out, destroyed Ms. Spiller’s home and the artwork she spent decades painting.
