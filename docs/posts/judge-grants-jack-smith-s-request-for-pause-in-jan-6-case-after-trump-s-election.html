    <h1>Judge Grants Jack Smith’s Request for Pause in Jan. 6 Case After Trump’s Election</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A longstanding Justice Department policy bars the prosecution of sitting presidents. Mr. Smith has already opened discussions with department leaders about how best to wind down both the election interference case and the other federal case he pursued against Mr. Trump — the one in Florida in which he was accused of illegally holding on to classified documents after he left office.</p><p>The request to pause the case in Washington was the first overt sign that Mr. Smith and his team are in the throes of figuring out how to shut down the two prosecutions.</p><p>Judge Chutkan’s decision to grant the request spares Mr. Trump’s lawyers from a Nov. 21 deadline to file a significant pretrial legal document.</p><p>In that filing, Mr. Trump’s lawyers were expected to lay out a detailed argument for why Mr. Trump should not face trial at all on the election interference charges because of the Supreme Court’s ruling this summer granting him a broad form of immunity against prosecution for official acts he took in office.</p><p>For the moment at least, Mr. Smith and his team have not made a similar request to pause efforts to revive the classified documents case, which was dismissed in its entirety this summer by Judge Aileen M. Cannon. Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, tossed out all of the charges on the grounds that Mr. Smith was unlawfully appointed to his post as special counsel.</p></div></div>
