    <h1>Harvard, Under Pressure, Revamps D.E.I. Office</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Trump administration also opened another front in its fight with the university on Monday, accusing the Harvard Law Review, an independent student-run journal, of racial discrimination in journal membership and article selection. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/ed-hhs-launch-title-vi-investigations-of-harvard-university-and-harvard-law-review-amid-allegations-of-discriminatory-practices" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> announcing that the law review was under investigation, Craig Trainor, the Department of Education’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said the journal “appears to pick winners and losers on the basis of race, employing a spoils system in which the race of the legal scholar is as, if not more, important than the merit of the submission.” </p><p>Responding to the announcement, Harvard Law School emphasized its commitment to ensuring that programs it oversees comply with the law, but pointed out that the journal is legally independent. A similar claim against the Harvard Law Review was <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/8/11/fasorp-suit-dismissed/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dismissed in federal court in 2019</a>. </p><p>In announcing that Harvard&#39;s diversity office was being revamped, Sherri Ann Charleston, formerly the chief diversity officer, said the university should bring people together based on their backgrounds and perspectives and “not the broad demographic groups to which they belong.”</p><p>Dr. Charleston’s title has been changed to chief community and campus life officer.</p><p>The Trump administration included abolishing D.E.I. efforts in a long <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list</a> of demands it sent to Harvard two weeks ago, which the university would have to meet to continue receiving federal funding. Among other requirements, the administration ordered Harvard to appoint an external overseer to monitor students, faculty and staff for “viewpoint diversity,” to ban international students hostile to “American values,” and to eliminate activist faculty. </p></div></div>
