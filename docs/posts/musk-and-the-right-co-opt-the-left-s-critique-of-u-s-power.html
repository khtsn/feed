The Central Intelligence Agency’s infiltration of the American left. “Rogue U.S.A.I.D. operations in Cuba.” And the windfalls American oil companies have reaped from “U.S. regime change efforts.”</p><p>But Mr. Rogan’s guest on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPPc8OVNngg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Feb. 12 episode</a> of “The Joe Rogan Experience” was not a Marxist professor or a muckraking Intercept writer. He was a former speechwriter in President Trump’s first administration named Mike Benz, whose work has been cited regularly by Elon Musk as justification for shutting down U.S.A.I.D., the 64-year-old foreign aid agency.</p><p>“The MAGA movement is fighting the ghost of Ronald Reagan,” Mr. Benz said, referring to the former president’s support for international development.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Amid all the radical moves early in the second Trump presidency, this might be the most literally radical: the borrowing of historically left-wing critiques of American power to justify the right-wing ambition of dismantling longstanding government agencies.</p><p>For decades, influential thinkers on the left have criticized American soft-power programs, covert operations and military presence abroad as parts of a particularly American form of imperialism: one that subverts the popular will of other countries’ citizens to serve the interests of the U.S. government and multinational corporations while also producing dangerous consequences — unfettered presidential power, diminished civil liberties — at home.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies have borrowed liberally from this argument while turning it on its head. They have been using it to justify new frontiers of executive power and the extraordinary empowerment of Mr. Musk, the world’s wealthiest individual.</p><p>“These left-wing critiques appear to now be being adopted, appropriated and weaponized by MAGA and Trump loyalists,” said Hugh Wilford, a professor of history at California State University, Long Beach and the author of “The CIA: An Imperial History.”</p><p>As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Mr. Musk has accused U.S.A.I.D. of “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1887534216453263617" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">money laundering</a>” and has reposted claims that the agency’s government-backed, democracy-promotion programs are “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1889966041297776839" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a C.I.A. front</a>.” During her confirmation hearings, Tulsi Gabbard, the new director of national intelligence, <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/tU8HNjJK3XEqZgFDoVW9OffGQ1X9UIvU2Joiv2mhdVI98DdLpCkP7LYz5pwnS03pAL-WwUYb29n7RXikCJFrLGx9yvw?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=8738.67" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized</a> covert operations to arm proxies in Syria and “regime change wars” across the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services secretary, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/06/us/politics/rfk-campaign-kennedy-family.html" title="">blamed</a> the war in Ukraine on the foreign policy establishment’s “strategic grand plan to destroy any country such as Russia that resists American imperial expansion.”</p><p>The Center for Renewing America, a think tank that was until recently led by Russ Vought, Mr. Trump’s Office of Management and Budget director, has joined in, too. A <a href="https://americarenewing.com/primer-the-national-endowment-for-democracy-and-an-ngo-ecosystem-actively-undermining-america/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a> the group published this month accused the National Endowment for Democracy, a government-funded organization created during the Reagan presidency to support democracy and civil society abroad, of being a “tool for neoconservative nation-building.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Ronald Reagan after a speech to the nation addressing the Iran-contra affair in 1987. “The MAGA movement is fighting the ghost of Ronald Reagan,” Mike Benz, a former speechwriter in President Trump’s first administration, said on Joe Rogan’s podcast earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diana Walker/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>None of this is without precedent in the politics of Mr. Trump, who has revived a long dormant strain of Republican skepticism of foreign interventions. Mr. Trump criticized the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a candidate in 2016, and he <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/24/u-s-agency-for-international-development-foreign-aid-state-department-trump-slash-foreign-funding/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">considered</a> rolling U.S.A.I.D. into the State Department early in his first presidency. He also inveighed against the country’s intelligence agencies and the F.B.I. after he came under investigation late in that election for his campaign’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/us/politics/senate-intelligence-russian-interference-report.html" title="">contacts with Russian officials</a>.</p><p>But Mr. Trump’s second administration has gone further, embracing specific narratives about <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2014/03/05/kucinich-blames-u-s-for/24163433007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nefarious motives</a> behind humanitarian aid and covert operations that were long the province of the left, even as his advisers denounce the same programs as hotbeds of “<a href="https://x.com/RichardGrenell/status/1888382972514250962" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">far left activists</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump has put the left in the awkward position of defending institutions and policies it once criticized.</p><p>“It’s this weird fun-house mirror moment,” said Daniel Immerwahr, a historian of U.S. foreign policy at Northwestern University.</p><p>Mr. Benz, who will speak this week at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, is perhaps the clearest example of the phenomenon. A former corporate lawyer and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/michael-benz-rising-voice-conservative-criticism-online-censorship-rcna119213" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anonymous far-right social media personality</a>, he has become a clear influence on Mr. Musk.</p><p>Mr. Musk has replied to Mr. Benz’s posts close to 300 times on X and has cited him in nearly half of his posts mentioning U.S.A.I.D., which he has blamed for <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886855362713727145" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">censorship in Europe</a> and Representative <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886445126475784383" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s political career</a>, among other things. Mr. Benz did not respond to a request for comment for this article.</p><p>In podcast interviews and posts on X that have earned him nearly one million followers on the platform, Mr. Benz claims that contemporary efforts to combat online misinformation can trace their lineages back to a Cold War-era history of intelligence agencies using benign-appearing development programs as pawns in the war against Soviet influence across the globe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The most egregious such activities were curtailed after a series of revelations about intelligence-agency abuses beginning in the late 1960s, which led to overhauls of the Central Intelligence Agency and other institutions in the 1970s. The 1980s saw <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/01/world/missionaries-for-democracy-us-aid-for-global-pluralism.html" title="">more transparent soft-power initiatives</a> under the auspices of agencies like U.S.A.I.D. and government-funded organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy.</p><p>Broadly supported by anti-communist Republicans and Democrats, these efforts were often met with skepticism on the left — and now, by Mr. Benz and Mr. Musk.</p><p>They argue that U.S. government influence campaigns that once undermined the populist left in other countries were co-opted by liberals after the end of the Cold War, and are now being used against the populist right at home and abroad. As evidence, they point to grants to independent media and civil-society programs in Europe that have been critical of right-wing governments and support for misinformation-countering campaigns that have often targeted right-wing social media activity.</p><p>“USAID is/was a radical-left political psy op,” Mr. Musk wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886449983483748472" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Feb. 3 post on X</a> citing Mr. Benz.</p><p>To make this case, Mr. Benz has marshaled the decades-old work of left-wing journalists and scholars, such as the historian Alfred McCoy, whose <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP74B00415R000400050035-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> on the C.I.A. and U.S.A.I.D.’s role in heroin trafficking in Southeast Asia earned the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/22/archives/cia-aides-assail-asia-drug-charge-agency-fights-reports-that-it.html" title="">ire of the C.I.A.</a> in the early 1970s.</p><p>Other arguments made by Trump allies echo those of President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Russian-funded media outlets. Following popular protests against Kremlin-friendly governments in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014, which were supported by the <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080401-4.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bush</a> and <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/12/remarks-president-obama-and-ukraine-prime-minister-yatsenyuk-after-bilat" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Obama</a> administrations and American <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/549500" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nongovernmental organizations</a>, the <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/obama-russia-lavrov-coup-ukraine/26826632.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kremlin cast that support</a> as a “coup” and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/world/europe/in-cold-war-echo-obama-strategy-writes-off-putin.html" title="">continuation of the United States’ Cold War machinations</a>.

In the post-Cold War period, “I would venture that U.S.A.I.D. is as good if not better than any of the others that are out there,” he said, and cutting it would be “a tragedy for the people affected.”</p><p>“I think it’s sort of appalling, actually,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Charles Homans is a reporter for The Times and The Times Magazine, covering national politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charles-homans">More about Charles Homans</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/agency-for-international-development">Agency for International Development</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Upending U.S.-Russia Policy: </strong>As peace talks opened in Saudi Arabia, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html">made clear that the days of isolating Russia were over</a> and suggested that Ukraine was to blame for being invaded, causing European leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/europe-trump-russia-ukraine.html">to recalibrate their relations</a> with the U.S.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Job Cuts: </strong>Thousands of civil servants have been targeted at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/national-science-foundation-firings.html">Interior Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/fda-cdc-health-department-trump.html">Department of Health and Human Services</a>, including scientists and public health leaders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Howard Lutnick Confirmed: </strong>As commerce secretary, the longtime Wall Street executive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/howard-lutnick-confirmed-commerce.html">will help oversee an agenda around tariffs and protectionism</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Race in Schools: </strong>The Education Department gave schools <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/education-dept-race-based-programs.html">14 days to end any race-based programs</a> and prohibited any nod to race in “all other aspects of student, academic and campus life.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Presidents’ Day Protests:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/trump-musk-protests-50501-presidents-day.html">Thousands of Americans took to the streets across the U.S.</a>, denouncing President Trump as a “king” for his efforts to terminate federal workers and to fire prosecutors and independent watchdogs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mixing Business and Politics:</strong> Trump entered his second term <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/politics/trump-ethics-conflicts-business-adams.html">with an expanded portfolio of business interests</a>, ignoring norms recognized for decades, former prosecutors and ethics lawyers say.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
