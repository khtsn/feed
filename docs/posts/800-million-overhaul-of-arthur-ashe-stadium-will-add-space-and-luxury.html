The United States Tennis Association, which runs the tournament, said work would not interfere with the tournament over the next two years.</p><p>“We are doubling down on the continued growth that we are seeing in tennis in this country,” said Danny Zausner, the association’s chief operating officer, who helped unveil the renovation at a news conference on Monday.</p><p>The U.S.T.A., a nonprofit organization whose mandate is to develop tennis in the United States, said it would pay for the entire project through reserve funds and debt and that the project would not require any more land in Flushing Meadows Corona Park.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rendering of the proposed renovations outside Arthur Ashe.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">United States Tennis Association</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The courtyard outside the stadium.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>New York City owns the 46 acres in the park that houses the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The city leases it to the U.S.T.A. — just as it leases the land that the Yankees and Mets stadiums sit on to the teams’ owners. The U.S.T.A. has already spent over $1 billion on construction around the grounds over the past decade, adding three new stadiums and refurbishing all the outer courts and practice areas.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Ashe is a big moneymaker with a tournament that generates hundreds of millions of dollars each year. It is the world’s largest tennis stadium with a capacity of almost 24,000. That figure will remain roughly the same.</p><p>What will change is the feel and look as walkways and seating areas get expanded and refitted, adding 40 percent additional space within the stadium, according to Mr. Zausner.</p><p>The most visible changes will be in the crowded concourse levels. Those will be fitted with high-end shops, restaurants and clubs and gleaming, expanded walkways, providing more space to areas that can get <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/nyregion/us-open-crowds.html" title="">jammed with fans at times</a>. Since 2017, attendance at the U.S. Open has grown year over year (excluding the 2020 pandemic year, when no fans were allowed) and last year it topped one million for the first time.</p><p>Despite its immense size and once-modern sheen, Arthur Ashe Stadium is from a different era. It opened in 1997 and is the second-oldest major sports venue in the metropolitan New York area, after Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers. </p><p>Ashe Stadium is also the final of the two dozen courts at the National Tennis Center to be remodeled. The last work done there was the retractable roof that debuted in 2016.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The architect for the project is Rossetti, the same firm that originally designed Ashe, along with most of the other recent upgrades on the grounds.</p><p>The plan will shift the existing luxury suites higher and add 2,000 new seats to the lower bowl of the stadium, increasing that number to 5,000. It will also include seven new bunker suites, the luxury spectator lounges dug out below court level that have provided large revenue streams at other arenas, like Madison Square Garden.</p><p>The glass-and-brick players building, which will cost a projected $250 million, will sit on an existing parking lot, and tower over the five practice courts. It will include a two-story garage plus indoor and outdoor training facilities and opulent lounges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rendering of the players’ center and practice courts.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">United States Tennis Association</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Stacey Allaster, the tournament director, said on Monday that the center will help ensure that players are fit and able to perform at a high level for hundreds of thousands of spectators after a long season of competition.</p><p>“Happy players, happy fans,” Ms. Allaster said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Waldstein is a Times reporter who writes about the New York region, with an emphasis on sports.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Beekeeper Charged With a Genocidal Secret:</strong> Faustin Nsabumukunzi lived quietly in New York.
