The price was the highest yet paid for a Surrealist work of art at auction, and made Magritte the 16th artist to break the $100 million threshold, according to data compiled by the French market analyst company <a href="https://www.artprice.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Artprice</a>.</p><p>Fellow nine-figure heavyweights include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/arts/design/leonardo-da-vinci-salvator-mundi-christies-auction.html" title="">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/arts/design/klimt-lady-with-a-fan-auction.html" title="">Gustav Klimt</a>, <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/artists/amedeo-modigliani?lotavailability=All&amp;sortby=relevance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amedeo Modigliani</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/arts/design/warhol-auction-marilyn-monroe.html#:~:text=Warhol&#39;s%20&#39;Marilyn%2C&#39;%20at%20%24195,Artist%20%2D%20The%20New%20York%20Times" title="">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/arts/jean-michel-basquiat-painting-is-sold-for-110-million-at-auction.html" title="">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, <a href="https://www.francis-bacon.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Francis Bacon</a> and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/two-art-works-top-100-million-each-at-christies-sale/" title="">Pablo Picasso</a> (whose paintings have sold for more than $100 million at no fewer than six auctions).

It was one of the largest of the 17 versions of this subject that Magritte painted in oil. The best-known is probably the monumental “L’empire des lumières” in the <a href="https://www.guggenheim-venice.it/en/art/works/empire-of-light/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guggenheim Museum in Venice</a>. Ertegun’s slightly smaller canvas, which she acquired privately in 1968, is the first in the series to include water in the foreground.</p><p>“It’s maybe the best,” said Paolo Vedovi, the director of a <a href="https://www.vedovigallery.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gallery in Brussels</a> specializing in works by Magritte and other 20th-century artists. “It seems that every big collector now wants a Magritte.”</p><p>Vedovi added of the Surrealist’s appeal: “He’s so contemporary. Maybe you get away from this world and bad thinking. You don’t want something that is tough. He is poetic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Belgian Surrealist René Magritte (1898-1967), whose works often featured a bowler hat, still has the power to puzzle.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Christie’s sale of the Ertegun collection — along with the 55 big-ticket 20th-century works from other owners that followed — was the art market’s second major test since Donald J.
