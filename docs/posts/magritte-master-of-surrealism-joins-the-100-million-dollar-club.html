The price was the highest yet paid for a Surrealist work of art at auction, and made Magritte the 16th artist to break the $100 million threshold, according to data compiled by the French market analyst company <a href="https://www.artprice.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Artprice</a>.</p><p>Fellow nine-figure heavyweights include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/arts/design/leonardo-da-vinci-salvator-mundi-christies-auction.html" title="">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/arts/design/klimt-lady-with-a-fan-auction.html" title="">Gustav Klimt</a>, <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/artists/amedeo-modigliani?lotavailability=All&amp;sortby=relevance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amedeo Modigliani</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/arts/design/warhol-auction-marilyn-monroe.html#:~:text=Warhol&#39;s%20&#39;Marilyn%2C&#39;%20at%20%24195,Artist%20%2D%20The%20New%20York%20Times" title="">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/arts/jean-michel-basquiat-painting-is-sold-for-110-million-at-auction.html" title="">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, <a href="https://www.francis-bacon.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Francis Bacon</a> and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/two-art-works-top-100-million-each-at-christies-sale/" title="">Pablo Picasso</a> (whose paintings have sold for more than $100 million at no fewer than six auctions). To date, no living artist has achieved this price level at auction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Painted in 1954 and measuring almost five-feet-high, “The Empire of Light” was the last of 19 works that Christie’s offered from the collection of the socialite, designer and philanthropist <a href="https://www.christies.com/events/collection-mica-ertegun/what-is-on" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mica Ertegun</a>. It was one of the largest of the 17 versions of this subject that Magritte painted in oil. The best-known is probably the monumental “L’empire des lumières” in the <a href="https://www.guggenheim-venice.it/en/art/works/empire-of-light/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guggenheim Museum in Venice</a>. Ertegun’s slightly smaller canvas, which she acquired privately in 1968, is the first in the series to include water in the foreground.</p><p>“It’s maybe the best,” said Paolo Vedovi, the director of a <a href="https://www.vedovigallery.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gallery in Brussels</a> specializing in works by Magritte and other 20th-century artists. “It seems that every big collector now wants a Magritte.”</p><p>Vedovi added of the Surrealist’s appeal: “He’s so contemporary. Maybe you get away from this world and bad thinking. You don’t want something that is tough. He is poetic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Belgian Surrealist René Magritte (1898-1967), whose works often featured a bowler hat, still has the power to puzzle.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Magritte’s works, which capture everyday objects in decidedly unusual combinations, explore the boundary between reality and illusion. His penchant for bowler hats, a signature of his paintings, might have been inspired by his parents’ professions: His father, Léopold, was a tailor; his mother, Régina, a milliner. Magritte was 13 years old when she drowned herself in the River Sambre. He and his siblings were later raised by their grandmother.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Christie’s sale of the Ertegun collection — along with the 55 big-ticket 20th-century works from other owners that followed — was the art market’s second major test since Donald J. Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The art trade has been in a <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/09/02/global-turmoil-and-rising-taxes-tilt-art-trade-towards-new-era" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slump</a> for some two years. Increased stock prices and the prospect of tax cuts for corporations and affluent individuals have raised hopes that wealthy collectors would become more willing to spend their millions at auctions.</p><p>On Monday evening at Sotheby’s, bidders had splashed out $216 million with fees on 25 pieces from the collection of the beauty products mogul Sydell L. Miller, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/fashion/sydell-miller-dead.html" title="">who died in March</a>. The works had been estimated to raise some $170 million.<span>  </span>A Claude Monet painting of water lilies topped the sale with a price of $65.5 million. </p><p>“The election has definitely had an immediate impact on the marketplace,” Brett Gorvy, a founder of the New York-based dealership <a href="https://www.levygorvydayan.com/founders/brett-gorvy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lévy Gorvy Dayan</a>, said at the Sotheby’s auction. “The stock market has made people richer. We saw in our gallery the day after the election that deals were done by clients who had hesitated before.”</p><p>Gorvy added, “But it could be a honeymoon period.”</p><p>Indeed, bidding was more selective in the 31-lot session of Modern works that followed, and a Henri Matisse canvas that had been guaranteed by Sotheby’s to raise at least $12 million failed to sell.</p><p>“It’s not a rising tide that lifts all boats. Good pictures sell well. There is a flight to quality,” said the New York dealer William O’Reilly. When asked about the possible effect of the U.S. election on the art market he added, “It’s too early to tell.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ed Ruscha, “Standard Station, Ten-Cent Western Being Torn in Half,” 1964, sold for $68.2 million with fees.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ed Ruscha, via Christie&#39;s</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Momentum seemed to continue throughout Tuesday night at Christie’s, which, like Sotheby’s the night before, held two auctions.

All 19 lots found buyers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the second session,<span>  </span>record-breaking competition for Ertegun’s Magritte encouraged six bidders to chase after another day-night scene by the artist in the second sale, a gouache on paper. It sold for $18.8 million, more than twice its high estimate. “It’s about time for Magritte,” said David Rogath, a New York collector who owns several Magritte oil paintings. “The images are iconic and have entered popular culture.”</p><p>Another work to attract sustained competition was Ed Ruscha’s sharply painted, monumental gas station scene “Standard Station, Ten-Cent Western Being Torn in Half” from 1964. It fetched $68.2 million, an auction high for the octogenarian artist of the American West and more than 25 percent over its unpublished $50 million estimate.
