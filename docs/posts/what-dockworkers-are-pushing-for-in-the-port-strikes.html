Negotiations have stalled since June, when, citing the use of labor-saving technology at the port in Mobile, Ala., the I.L.A. broke off talks.</p><p>In the final hours before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/business/economy/port-strike.html" title="">Tuesday’s strikes</a>, there were some signs of movement in negotiations for a new six-year contract. But the sides remain at odds over wage increases and the use of automated equipment, which unionized workers say could jeopardize their jobs.</p><p>“We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our I.L.A. members deserve,” the union’s president, Harold J. Daggett, said on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what we know so far about the offers on the table.</p><h2 id="link-4e149004">A gap in wage-increase proposals</h2><p>Under the expired contract, the most senior longshoremen earn a top rate of $39 an hour. That’s up 11 percent from the start of their previous six-year contract. But over that same period, inflation has risen 24 percent. And while longshoremen with seniority can earn more than $200,000 a year with overtime, they say they have to put in long workweeks to earn that much.</p><p>The I.L.A. had been asking for a $5-an-hour raise for each of the six years of the new contract, which for the top-earning longshoremen would mean $69 an hour in the final year of the agreement, or a 77 percent total increase. But Mr. Daggett told CNBC on Tuesday that the union was now pushing for a roughly 61.5 percent raise. These offers could keep changing in the course of the negotiations.</p><p>The Maritime Alliance said on Monday evening that its latest offer would increase wages “nearly 50 percent” over the life of the contract — higher than a previous proposal. But the union rejected the offer.</p><p>Mr. Daggett recently said the raises offered by the Maritime Alliance were “insulting.” He has pointed to the billions of dollars major ocean shipping companies have made in recent years, arguing workers deserve a fair share. Employers in the Maritime Alliance made windfall profits during 2021 and 2022 when the pandemic prompted a surge in trade.</p><h2 id="link-135f031d">Disagreement on the use of automation</h2><p>Another sticking point: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/business/economy/port-workers-robots-automation-strike.html" title="">use of automation at ports</a>, which can take the form of driverless vehicles to shuttle containers around the wharf, cranes to stack boxes without much human intervention, or “auto gates” to process trucks. Talks between the I.L.A. and the port operators broke off in June after the union said it discovered a gate at a port in Mobile, Ala., that was using technology to check and let in trucks without the involvement of dockworkers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The I.L.A. has argued that use of the gate in Mobile violated its recently expired contract, which allows only for “semi-automated” machinery. </p><p>Port operators, which are often subsidiaries of global shipping companies, say modernization is necessary to ensure the efficient flow of cargo. The Maritime Alliance said on Monday that its latest offer would retain the previous contract’s language, allowing semi-automation. Early Tuesday, the I.L.A. said in a statement that the offer fell short of union demands “in wages and protections against automation.”</p><h2 id="link-2934ca40">Signs of movement in negotiations</h2><p>On Monday evening, just hours before the union contract expired, the Maritime Alliance said it had traded counteroffers related to wages with the I.L.A. — the first movement in negotiations in months.</p><p>“Both sides have moved off their previous positions,” the Maritime Alliance said in a news release. “We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining.”</p><p>But the key issues, particularly surrounding wages, still appear unresolved. The pressure to reach an agreement will only mount, now that a strike is underway.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
