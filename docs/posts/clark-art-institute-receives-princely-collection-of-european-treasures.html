Tavitian, who began collecting in 2004, served on the Clark’s board of trustees and showed some of his personal holdings there in a 2011 exhibition.</p><p>The collection he gave to the museum is “portrait-heavy,” Meslay said. Notable examples include Rubens’s “Portrait of a Young Man” (circa 1613-15), Parmigianino’s “Portrait of a Man” (circa 1530) and Vigée Le Brun’s “Self-Portrait in Studio Costume” (circa 1800).</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Parmigianino’s “Portrait of a Man,” circa 1530, oil on canvas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts, photo by Bruce M.

Tavitian Wing, which is scheduled to be completed in 2027 or 2028. The new building will be located on the Clark’s campus between two existing structures, the Manton Research Center and the original museum building, for which Selldorf designed previous renovations.</p><p>Discussions about the Tavitian gift began in 2019. Meslay and the Clark curators had a give-and-take with Tavitian and, after his death, with Beinecke and the foundation, about what the museum would receive, making requests for artworks they thought would fill gaps or otherwise dovetail with the Clark’s holdings.</p><p>“It’s a great addition, a great complement to what we have, but we’re not changing the Clark experience,” Meslay said. “Just making it far, far deeper.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
