In a way, the timing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/europe/greenland-trump-denmark.html" title="">couldn’t be better than now</a>, with Greenlanders re-examining their painful colonial history under Denmark and many people there itching to break off from Denmark, which still controls some of the island’s affairs.</p><p>But President Trump seems to have overplayed his cards — big time.</p><p>His decision, announced this weekend, to send a high-powered U.S. delegation to the island, apparently uninvited, is already backfiring. The administration tried to present it as a friendly trip, saying that Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President JD Vance, would attend a dogsled race this week with one of her sons, and that Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, would tour an American military base.</p><p>But instead of winning the hearts and minds of Greenland’s 56,000 people, the move, coupled with Mr. Trump’s recent talk of how he will “get it, one way or the other,” is pushing Greenland further away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Over the past 24 hours, the Greenlandic government has dropped its previous posture of being shy and vague in the face of Mr. Trump’s pushiness. Instead, it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/usha-vance-trump-us-greenland.html" title="">blasted him as “aggressive”</a> and asked Europe for backup. And the planned visit may only strengthen the bonds between Greenland — an ice-covered land three times the size of Texas — and Denmark.</p><p>“This will clearly have the opposite effect of what the Americans want,” said Lars Trier Mogensen, a political analyst based in Copenhagen. “This offensive pushes Greenland further away from the U.S., even though a year ago, all parties in Greenland were looking forward to more business with the Americans.”</p><p>His prediction? Greenlanders, he said, will “seek safety in the status quo — in the Kingdom of Denmark and its alliances.”</p><p>Even the dogsled race has reacted coolly. The organizers of the race — the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland’s Super Bowl of dogsled races — said on Sunday of Ms. Vance and her son, “We did not invite them,” but added that the event was open to the public and “they may attend as spectators.”</p><p>The Greenland drama began during Mr. Trump’s first term. He floated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/trump-buy-greenland.html" title="">the idea of buying the island</a> from Denmark — with people in his camp pointing to its location and geopolitical importance — but the plan faded away. As out-of-the-blue as that might have seemed, Mr. Trump wasn’t the first American official to raise the idea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 1868, Secretary of State William Seward, fresh off the Alaska purchase, commissioned a study about acquiring Greenland. He was interested in Greenland’s coal, but the plan didn’t go anywhere. American officials resurrected the idea in 1910 and again in 1946, seeing Greenland as a strategically important chunk of territory, but each time Denmark didn’t want to part with it.</p><p>What has changed in recent years is Denmark’s grip. In 2009, Denmark granted Greenland self-rule, which means the island runs most of its affairs except defense, foreign policy and a few others. A movement for full independence has been gathering steam. This month, a closely watched parliamentary election on the island <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/europe/greenland-election.html" title="">yielded an awkward and mixed result</a>: The first-place party wants to pursue independence slowly while the second-place finisher wants it much faster and includes a prominent pro-Trump member who attended the president’s inauguration.</p><p>This raises another issue: the timing of the visit, while Greenland’s parties are still negotiating over who will form the island’s next administration.</p><p>The visit has been in the works for weeks. Jørgen Boassen, a Greenlandic bricklayer and an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump, said he and Tom Dans, an American businessman who advised Mr. Trump about Arctic affairs during his first term, helped organize it.</p><p>“Instead of just rejecting them, we should be cooperating with the Americans,” Mr. Boassen said in an interview. “We simply can’t avoid the U.S. as a partner, whether in trade or defense.”</p><p>“I think it’s absolutely great that they’re coming,” he added. “It’s a huge promotion for our Greenlandic sled dogs.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeffrey Gettleman is an international correspondent based in London covering global events.
