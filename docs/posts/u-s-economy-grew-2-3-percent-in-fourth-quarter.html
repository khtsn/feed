That was down from 3.1 percent in the third quarter but nonetheless represented an encouraging end to a year in which the economy again defied expectations.</p><p>Robust consumer spending, underpinned by low unemployment and steady wage growth, helped keep the economy on track despite high interest rates, stubborn inflation and political turmoil at home and abroad. For the year as a whole, measured from the end of 2023 to the end of 2024, G.D.P. increased 2.5 percent, far ahead of forecasters’ expectations when the year began.</p><p>“We ended on a pretty strong note,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm KPMG. “It’s stunning how resilient and strong the economy has been.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The figures are preliminary and will be revised at least twice as more data becomes available.</p><p>But the economy entered the new year facing a new set of challenges. The whirlwind start to President Trump’s second term — including sweeping changes to immigration policy, a spending freeze that was announced and then rescinded and steep tariffs that could take effect as early as this weekend — has increased uncertainty for households and businesses. Economists warn that his proposals on trade and immigration, in particular, could lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/economy/trump-us-economy.html" title="">faster inflation, slower growth or both</a>.</p><p>“You really have all the right ingredients to support sustainable growth, but the question is, where will it be in 12 months’ time?” said Gregory Daco, chief economist for the consulting firm EY-Parthenon. “The risk is you break the economy.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
