That was down from the 3.1 percent growth rate in the third quarter but nonetheless represented an encouraging end to a year in which the economy once again defied expectations.</p><p>The figures are preliminary and will be revised at least twice as more complete data becomes available.</p><p>For the year as a whole, measured from the end of 2023 to the end of 2024, G.D.P. increased 2.5 percent, far ahead of forecasters’ expectations when the year began. Robust consumer spending, underpinned by low unemployment and steady wage growth, helped keep the economy on track despite high interest rates, stubborn inflation and political turmoil at home and abroad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We ended on a pretty strong note,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm KPMG. “It’s stunning how resilient and strong the economy has been.”</p><p>But the economy entered the new year facing a new set of challenges. The whirlwind start to President Trump’s second term — including sweeping changes to immigration policy, a spending freeze that was announced and then rescinded, and steep tariffs that could begin to take effect as early as this weekend — has increased uncertainty for both households and businesses. And while the full scope of Mr. Trump’s plans remains unclear, economists warn that his proposals on trade and immigration, in particular, could lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/economy/trump-us-economy.html" title="">faster inflation, slower growth, or both</a>.</p><p>“You really have all the right ingredients to support sustainable growth, but the question is, where will it be in 12 months’ time?” said Gregory Daco, chief economist for the consulting firm EY-Parthenon. “The risk is you break the economy.”</p><p>While the economy as a whole appears solid, there are pockets of weakness. Business investment has slowed. The housing market <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/business/economy/home-sales-mortgage-rates.html" title="">remains frozen in place</a>. Unemployed workers are taking longer to find jobs.</p><p>At the same time, progress on inflation has stalled in recent months. That has complicated the job facing policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who until recently had been expecting to be cutting interest rates in order to shore up economic growth. Instead, the Fed on Wednesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/economy/federal-reserve-what-to-watch.html" title="">held rates steady</a> and signaled that the bar for future rate cuts will be high.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, economists have warned for years for years that growth is in danger of faltering, only to be proved wrong. And the momentum at the end of 2024 should help the economy withstand whatever new threats emerge in 2025.</p><p>“We’ve been able to take a lot and keep going,” Ms. Swonk said. “We can look at all the models, but the models haven’t been that valuable.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Casselman writes about economics with a particular focus on stories involving data. He has covered the economy for nearly 20 years, and his recent work has focused on how trends in labor, politics, technology and demographics have shaped the way we live and work.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-casselman">More about Ben Casselman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
