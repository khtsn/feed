Europe’s <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2023/749765/EPRS_BRI(2023)749765_EN.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sanctions</a> have included an oil embargo, export and import restrictions on some technology, and strict financial limitations.</p><p>The bloc said it would maintain weapons-related sanctions “based on security grounds, including arms and technology that might be used for internal repression.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marjeh Square in Damascus on Monday.

Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Shara, met with President Emmanuel Macron of France a few weeks ago. At that time, Mr. Macron was still speaking in support of a gradual removal of European sanctions.</p><p>There was a reason for that cautious stance: European Union policymakers have remained alert to the possibility that the new Syrian government could go in the wrong direction. But they have also increasingly taken the view that keeping the sanctions could be self-defeating if they cause so much economic pain that they pave the way for instability.</p><p>“There are worries about whether the government is going in the right direction,” Ms. Kallas, the E.U. diplomat, <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/foreign-affairs-council-press-remarks-high-representative-kaja-kallas-upon-arrival-0_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Tuesday</a>. “But I think we do not have a choice. We actually either give them the possibility to stabilize the country, or we do not do that.”</p><p>Ms. Kallas was asked during a news conference on Tuesday whether the removal of sanctions on Syria had come in response to Mr. Trump’s recent announcement. The diplomat pushed back on that idea.</p><p>“We as the European Union are not as good at selling all these decisions we have made,” she said, noting that the bloc had been working on dialing back the restrictions for months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Europeans are not alone in worrying that the situation could deteriorate in Syria. Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, warned senators on Tuesday that Syria could be “weeks” from sliding into a “full-scale civil war of epic proportions.” Mr. Rubio, who suggested that preventing such upheaval was what drove the U.S. decision on sanctions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/syria-marco-rubio-trump-sanctions.html" title="">recently met</a> with his Syrian counterpart while both were in Turkey.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who met last week with Syria’s leader, said afterward that Mr. al-Shara had “a real shot at pulling it together,” but that Syria was “a torn-up country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria in Damascus in January.
