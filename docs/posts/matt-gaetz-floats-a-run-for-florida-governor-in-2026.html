Ron DeSantis, who was elected in 2018 and 2022, is term-limited.</p><p>“I have a compelling vision for the state,” Mr. Gaetz, a far-right provocateur, <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2025/01/07/matt-gaetz-i-am-starting-think-about-running-governor/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the Tampa Bay Times</a> in a report published on Tuesday.</p><p>In a telephone interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Mr. Gaetz said that he had spoken to Mr. Trump about a possible bid for governor and that he “knows that I have that ambition.” He declined to elaborate on their conversation, other than to say that the president-elect had shared advice with him and that he expected several of Mr. Trump’s other allies would contend for the job.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Requests for comment were also left with Mr. Trump’s aides.</p><p>Mr. Gaetz, 42, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-florida-us-house-1.html" title="">cruised to a fifth term</a> in his safely Republican House district on Florida’s panhandle on Nov. 5. But he resigned his seat on Nov. 13, shortly after Mr. Trump chose him for attorney general, trying to short-circuit the release of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/23/us/ethics-report-on-gaetz.html" title="">Ethics Committee report</a> that concluded he had engaged in sexual misconduct and taken illicit drugs, allegations that he has denied.</p><p>He also filed an 11th-hour lawsuit in federal court in an attempt to stop the report’s release, but that effort failed.</p><p>The panel found that from at least 2017 to 2020, Mr. Gaetz “regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him.” The report said that in 2017, Mr. Gaetz had “engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl,” who was paid.</p><p>From 2017 to 2019, the report said, Mr. Gaetz used or possessed illegal drugs, including cocaine and Ecstasy “on multiple occasions,” and accepted lavish gifts, including transportation to and lodging in the Bahamas, in excess of permissible amounts.</p><p>Asked on Wednesday if he believed the Ethics Committee’s report would hurt him in a race for governor, Mr. Gaetz scoffed at the idea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Those lies have been circling me for years,” he said.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/matt-gaetz-withdraws-trump-attorney-general.html" title="">withdrawing as Mr. Trump’s nominee for United States attorney general</a> — the first big setback to the president-elect during his transition — Mr. Gaetz was hired as host of a weekly prime-time show on the far-right <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaetz-oann-talk-show-conservative-adac07541f20a797fbab9c8f8695128d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One America News Network</a>.</p><p>In his remarks to the Tampa Bay Times, Mr. Gaetz suggested that he could help stabilize an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/business/insurance-hurricane-milton-helene.html" title="">insurance crisis</a> that has been gripping Florida, one that was exacerbated by Hurricanes Helene and Milton and has roiled both the industry and those who rely on its coverage.</p><p>“I understand how to fix the insurance problem, and it’s not to hand the keys to the state over to the insurance industry,” he said. “If I run, I would be the most pro-consumer candidate on the Republican side.”</p><p>Mr. Gaetz’s floating of his interest in the governor’s office came just days after members of 119th Congress were sworn in on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Gaetz was known for his bare-knuckles political style in trying to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda.</p><p>The governor’s race in Florida, once a battleground state that has been tilting toward Republicans, is one of the high-profile contests on the election calendar in 2026.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The contest is shaping up to be another key test of Mr. Trump’s influence in his adopted home state, where his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/us/politics/ron-desantis-bio-facts.html" title="">endorsement</a> helped carry Mr. DeSantis to victory in 2018 in a tight race.</p><p>Possible other Republican contenders include Representative Byron Donalds, who was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/27/us/politics/trump-campaign-byron-donalds-florida.html" title="">prominent surrogate</a> for Mr. Trump among Black voters in 2024 and has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-desantis-florida-governor-2026-00158501" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">welcomed speculation</a> about his interest in the job.</p><p>On the Democratic side, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/06/jared-moskowitz-florida-governor-2026-00145320" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Representative Jared Moskowitz</a>, a centrist whom Mr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/04/us/politics/ron-desantis-jared-moskowitz-florida.html" title="">DeSantis tapped to run the state’s disaster-relief agency</a> in 2018, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/06/jared-moskowitz-florida-governor-2026-00145320" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Politico</a> last March that he had not ruling out running.
