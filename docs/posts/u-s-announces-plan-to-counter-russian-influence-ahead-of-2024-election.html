Garland detailed the actions taken by the Justice Department. They include the indictment of two Russian employees of RT, the state-owned broadcaster, who used a company in Tennessee to spread content, and the takedown of a Russian malign influence campaign known as Doppelgänger.</p><p>“The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power engages in political activities or seeks to influence public discourse,” Mr. Garland said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on ANO Dialog, a Russian nonprofit that helps run the Doppelgänger network, as well as the editor in chief of RT, Margarita S. Simonyan, and her deputies.</p><p>The State Department has offered a $10 million reward for information pertaining to foreign interference in an American election. The department specifically said it was seeking information on a group known as Russian Angry Hackers Did It, or RaHDit.</p><p>The State Department also said it would designate five Russian state-funded news outlets, including RT, Ruptly and Sputnik, as foreign government missions and restrict the issuance of visas to people working for Kremlin-supported media institutions.</p><p>American officials have stepped up their warnings about Russian election influence efforts. American spy agencies have assessed that the Kremlin favors former President Donald J. Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the November contest, seeing him as more skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An RT broadcast in Moscow in 2019.

In subsequent elections, U.S. intelligence officials more aggressively called out Russian, Chinese and Iranian efforts to influence American elections.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Officials say that fighting election interference has been more difficult this year. Some Americans, particularly Mr. Trump’s supporters, see accusations that Russia is spreading disinformation as efforts to undermine their views.</p><p>Mr. Garland said the charges announced on Wednesday were not the end of the case: “The investigation is ongoing.”</p><p>The Justice Department and the F.B.I. have also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/technology/us-fbi-russia-election-disinformation.html" title="">investigating a handful of Americans</a> accused of knowingly spreading false Kremlin narratives. But officials have emphasized that they are not aiming to curb free speech. Americans who merely repeat or spread stories they see on Russian state media are not being investigated as part of the efforts, officials said.</p><p>The officials say that RT has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/russian-bots-artificial-intelligence-propaganda.html" title="">spread disinformation through bots</a> and other means, but that they are looking more closely at how the Kremlin and its spy agencies influence the election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As news of the indictments broke, <a href="https://russian.rt.com/world/news/1364197-rt-ssha-vmeshatelstvo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RT posted a sarcastic response on its website</a> from Anna Belkina, its deputy editor in chief. “There are three certainties in life: death, taxes and RT’s interference in the American elections,” the response read in part. </p><p>The indictments on Wednesday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-rt-employees-indicted-covertly-funding-and-directing-us-company-published-thousands" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">charged two Russian employees of RT</a>, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are accused of spending $10 million to secretly pay the unnamed Tennessee company to spread nearly 2,000 English-language videos on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and X. </p><p>Disinformation experts have long struggled to measure the effectiveness of Russian influence campaigns, but Justice Department officials said the videos, most of which support the goals of the Russian government, have gained 16 million views on YouTube.</p><p>Mr. Garland said the videos were “often consistent with Russia’s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Russian interests, particularly its ongoing war in Ukraine.” The Tennessee company, he said, never disclosed its ties to the Russian government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, was among those hit with sanctions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>After a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/22/world/moscow-shooting" title="">terrorist attack on a concert venue</a> in Moscow in March, Ms. Afanasyeva directed the company to focus on the false narrative that Ukraine was responsible.</p><p>Justice Department officials declined to identify the firm, but the one in the indictment uses the same slogan as Tenet Media, a company registered in Tennessee that publishes videos and other content broadly supportive of Mr. Trump. The company — and its most prominent commentators — did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The indictment does not directly accuse the company of wrongdoing but said that it had ties to RT and that its founders referred to their sponsor as “the Russians.”</p><p>Critics of the U.S. moves said the indictments raised free speech issues and the possibility that the Biden administration was trying to censor pro-Russian commentary.</p><p>Paul M. Barrett, the deputy director of the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, said the government had to tread carefully to distinguish between foreign election interference and First Amendment protections of free speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The dividing line is when you identify activity, particularly concealed activity, that is circumventing established regulations for how we try to prevent foreign interference in our elections,” he said. If that line is crossed, he added, “that’s a complication, but it’s not a reason to just run up the free speech flag and throw up your hands and we’re helpless in the face of Vladimir Putin’s very clever operatives.”</p><p>The United States has already taken action against Russian organizations it believes are trying to influence American politics. In March, the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2195" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a Russian group</a> that has aided efforts to create fake news sites that spread misinformation, and in July it seized two internet domains that it also linked to RT and the Federal Security Service, a successor of the Soviet K.G.B.</p><p>The Justice Department action builds on that, saying it was seizing 32 more domains that were used to covertly spread Russian propaganda. According to the government affidavit, the Doppelgänger campaign is run by Sergei Kiriyenko, a former prime minister who is now President Vladimir V. Putin’s first deputy chief of staff.</p><p>Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said the fake news sites had been seized by the government as of noon.</p><p>“When we learn that adversaries overseas are trying to hide who they are and where their propaganda is coming from, as part of campaigns to deliberately sow discord, we’re going to continue to do everything we can to expose their hidden hand and disrupt their efforts,” Mr. Wray said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Garland said a Russian internal planning document stated that “the aim of the campaign is securing Russia’s preferred outcome in the election.”</p><p>The document, produced for the Social Design Agency, outlined plans to influence U.S. voters without identifying that the content was coming from the Russian government.</p><p>It lays out a plan to target voters in swing states (as determined by The New York Times’s polling efforts), as well as voters in conservative states like Alabama, Texas and Kansas. The document says U.S. citizens of Hispanic descent, Jews and video gamers would also be targeted.</p><p>The goal, according to the document and the indictment, was to push Americans to support the idea that the United States should focus on “addressing its domestic issues instead of wasting money in Ukraine.”</p><p>The Justice Department blocks out the names of the candidates the Russians support, but the document says that “it makes sense for Russia to put a maximum effort” into ensuring that the Republican Party’s view, and in particular the opinions of Mr. Trump’s supporters, “wins over U.S. public opinion.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Doppelgänger network used sites that impersonated legitimate news entities and fake social media profiles impersonating Americans.</p><p>The fake news sites targeted specific audiences in the United States by mimicking sites like Fox News and The Washington Post. The posts on the fake Post site had a pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine viewpoint, according to the court papers.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Edward Wong<!-- -->, <!-- -->Alan Feuer<!-- --> and <!-- -->Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> from Washington, and <!-- -->Paul Sonne<!-- --> from Berlin.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julian E.
