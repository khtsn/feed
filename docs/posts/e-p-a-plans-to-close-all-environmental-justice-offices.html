intends to eliminate Environmental Protection Agency offices responsible for addressing the disproportionately high levels of pollution facing poor communities, according to a memo from Lee Zeldin, the agency administrator.</p><p>In the internal memo, viewed by The New York Times, Mr. Zeldin informed agency leaders that he was directing “the reorganization and elimination” of the offices of environmental justice at all 10 E.P.A. regional offices as well as the one in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Zeldin’s move effectively ends three decades of work at the E.P.A. to try to ease the pollution that burdens poor and minority communities, which are frequently located near highways, power plants, industrial plants and other polluting facilities. Studies have shown that people who live in those communities have higher rates of asthma, heart disease and other health problems, compared with the national average.</p><p>“If anybody needed a clearer sign that this administration gives not a single damn for the people of the United States, this is it,” Matthew Tejada, a former E.P.A. official who is now a senior vice president for environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Fund, a nonprofit organization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Molly Vaseliou, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, described the moves as “organizational improvements” that align with President Trump’s orders to end wasteful spending and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Zeldin suggested that environmental justice — <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-02/documents/team-ej-lexicon.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which the agency defined</a> in 2013 as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income” with respect to environmental laws — was tantamount to discrimination.</p><p>“President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people,” Mr. Zeldin said. “Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs.”</p><p>The decision comes after Mr. Zeldin canceled hundreds of grants this week, many of them designated for environmental justice.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Zeldin placed 168 employees who work on environmental justice on leave, but this week a federal judge forced him to rehire dozens of them after finding that the action had no legal basis. Several E.P.A. employees said they were bracing for many of those people to again be eliminated, as the agency and others prepared for widespread reductions in force.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last week, the E.P.A. and the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/climate/trump-administration-lawsuit-denka-carcinogen.html" title="">dropped a lawsui</a>t against a petrochemical plant by the Biden administration, which had argued that the plant increased the cancer risk in a predominantly Black community in Louisiana.</p><p>The lawsuit was one of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s most visible efforts to try to improve conditions in an area that is known as “Cancer Alley” because of its history with toxic pollution.</p><p>The E.P.A. withdrew its referral of the case for prosecution “to align with Administrator Lee Zeldin’s pledge to end the use of ‘environmental justice’ as a tool for advancing ideological priorities,” the Justice Department said in a news release.</p><p>As president, Mr. Biden emphasized the need to address the unequal burden that people of color carry from exposure to environmental hazards. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/climate/biden-environmental-justice.html" title="">He created the White House Office of Environmental Justice</a> and directed federal agencies to deliver 40 percent of the benefits of environmental programs to marginalized communities that face a disproportionate amount of pollution. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/factsheet-epas-office-environmental-justice" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The E.P.A.’s Office of Environmental Justice</a>, which was created by the Clinton administration, significantly expanded under Mr. Biden.</p><p>The Trump administration has now erased all of that.</p><p>“This doesn’t make America healthier or greater,” Mr. Tejada said. “It make us sicker, smaller and uglier than we have been in at least a generation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lisa Friedman is a Times reporter who writes about how governments are addressing climate change and the effects of those policies on communities.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman">More about Lisa Friedman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/environmental-protection-agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump Changes His Tune:</strong> President Trump’s sweeping promises are running headlong into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/trump-tariffs-fox-news-recession.html">reality of governing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Possible Antisemitism Penalties:</strong> The Trump administration warned 60 universities that they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/trump-colleges-antisemitism.html">could face penalties from pending investigations into antisemitism</a> on college campuses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mahmoud Khalil:</strong> The lawful permanent resident who helped lead protests at Columbia University against high civilian casualties in Gaza was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/trump-rubio-khalil-columbia-student-protests.html">arrested by immigration officers</a> and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/mahmoud-khalil-legal-resident-deportation.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iron Grip on Republicans:</strong> In his second term, Trump is cultivating warm relationships with G.O.P. lawmakers — and using the implicit threat of ruining them if they stray — to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress.html">keep them in line behind his agenda</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disruption to Tuberculosis Treatments: </strong>The United States was the major international funder of tuberculosis programs.
