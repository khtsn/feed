Studies have shown that people who live in those communities have higher rates of asthma, heart disease and other health problems, compared with the national average.</p><p>“If anybody needed a clearer sign that this administration gives not a single damn for the people of the United States, this is it,” said Matthew Tejada, a former E.P.A. official who is now a senior vice president for environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit organization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Molly Vaseliou, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, described the moves as “organizational improvements” that align with President Trump’s orders to end wasteful spending and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Zeldin suggested that environmental justice — <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-02/documents/team-ej-lexicon.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which the agency defined</a> in 2013 as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income” with respect to environmental laws — was tantamount to discrimination.</p><p>“President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people,” Mr. Zeldin said. “Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs.”</p><p>The decision comes after Mr. Zeldin canceled hundreds of grants this week, many of them designated for environmental justice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Last month, Mr. Zeldin placed 168 employees who work on environmental justice on leave, but this week a federal judge forced him to rehire dozens of them after finding that the action had no legal basis. Several E.P.A. employees said they were bracing for many of those people to again be eliminated, as the agency and others prepared for widespread reductions in force.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last week, the E.P.A. and the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/climate/trump-administration-lawsuit-denka-carcinogen.html" title="">dropped a lawsui</a>t against a petrochemical plant by the Biden administration, which had argued that the plant increased the cancer risk in a predominantly Black community in Louisiana.</p><p>The lawsuit was one of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s most visible efforts to try to improve conditions in an area that is known as “Cancer Alley” because of its history with toxic pollution.</p><p>The E.P.A. withdrew its referral of the case for prosecution “to align with Administrator Lee Zeldin’s pledge to end the use of ‘environmental justice’ as a tool for advancing ideological priorities,” the Justice Department said in a news release.</p><p>As president, Mr. Biden emphasized the need to address the unequal burden that people of color carry from exposure to environmental hazards. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/climate/biden-environmental-justice.html" title="">He created the White House Office of Environmental Justice</a> and directed federal agencies to deliver 40 percent of the benefits of environmental programs to marginalized communities that face a disproportionate amount of pollution. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/factsheet-epas-office-environmental-justice" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The E.P.A.’s Office of Environmental Justice</a>, which was created by the Clinton administration, significantly expanded under Mr. Biden.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Trump administration has now erased all of that.</p><p>“This doesn’t make America healthier or greater,” Mr. Tejada said. “It makes us sicker, smaller and uglier than we have been in at least a generation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>March 12, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to a nonprofit organization.
