Nearly a week after the Israeli announcement, the offensive was still mostly limited to deadly airstrikes, with slow ground maneuvers.</p><p>The threat came during a short-lived round of cease-fire negotiations that has since dwindled despite pressure from the Trump administration on both sides to agree to a truce. The Israeli military has said that Hamas could halt the advance by releasing the hostages it holds.</p><p>Britain, France, and Canada issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/israel-allies-denounce-gaza-offensive.html" title="">a rare public reprimand of Israel</a> this week, demanding that it cease its widening military offensive in Gaza. That laid bare growing rifts between Israel and its traditional Western allies and prompted a furious Israeli response.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The announcements of new military maneuvers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/world/middleeast/israel-new-invasion-of-gaza.html" title="">could also be a negotiating ploy</a> to pressure Hamas to make compromises.</p><p>It has been especially deadly lately for Palestinians in Gaza. The enclave has been devastated by the war and a total blockade on aid for more than two months, which has put the population at risk of starvation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-57d0d235">How far have Israeli troops advanced?</h2><p>For weeks, Mr. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have been threatening a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/israel-buildup-soldiers-hamas-gaza.html" title="">major escalation</a> in Gaza unless Hamas agreed to Israel’s terms for a truce.</p><p>Then on Sunday, Israel announced that its forces had launched “extensive ground operations” throughout the enclave, saying that soldiers from five divisions were participating in the renewed offensive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The military said it would dissect Gaza into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-ground-operation.html" title="">separate zones</a> while ordering Palestinian civilians to leave combat areas.</p><p>But details about the renewed offensive and Israeli troop movements were scarce. And despite escalating its rhetoric, the Israeli military on Friday had yet to begin long-awaited major advance, which could involve thousands of ground troops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-05-19-gaza-israel-may-operation-may18-activity" data-id="100000010177834" data-source-id="100000010177834"><div slug="2025-05-19-gaza-israel-may-operation-may18-activity" data-sourceid="100000010177834" id="embed-id-100000010177834">
