Britain, France, and Canada issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/israel-allies-denounce-gaza-offensive.html" title="">a rare public reprimand of Israel</a> on May 20, demanding that it cease its widening military offensive in Gaza. That laid bare growing rifts between Israel and its traditional Western allies and prompted a furious Israeli response. Much of the criticism had focused on Israel’s decision to block aid to Gaza for more than two months beginning in March, exacerbating already dire conditions in the enclave.</p><p>Since the new aid system began its first full day of operations in the last week of May, there has been evidence of continual disarray and multiple reports of violence at or around distribution sites run by the new group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, as hungry Palestinians gather en masse, hoping to receive some food amid a stark scarcity of supplies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Here is what to know about the situation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4619dac2">Is any aid getting into Gaza?</h2><p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said on Sunday that it has so far distributed about 67,200 aid boxes in Gaza containing about 4,720,000 meals, and that it plans to scale up operations.</p><p>The United Nations has said the group’s supplies constitute a mere trickle of assistance faced with the needs of a population of about two million people at risk of famine. And the disarray evidenced in videos and reported by Palestinians in Gaza through the initial days of operations highlights the desperate situation.</p><p>At least 20 people were killed and more than 100 wounded on Sunday near one aid site in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, according to local health officials. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its paramedics had evacuated at least 23 people killed, all with gunshot wounds. In a statement, Gaza’s health ministry said 31 had been killed.</p><p>The Israeli military initially said it was unaware of any injuries from Israeli fire at the site, but a military official later briefed reporters that troops had fired warning shots toward “suspects,” who approached them from about a kilometer away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Thursday, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said warning shots and smoke bombs were fired to disperse crowds at a distribution hub opened in central Gaza. Tuesday, the first full day of operations, began with a single site opening, where crowds overran the location at one point.</p><p>Separately from the new system, some U.N. aid trucks are still making their way through a single border crossing into southern Gaza. But U.N. officials say that distribution to warehouses and bakeries inside Gaza has been hampered by the lack of secure routes, and that negligible quantities of food are reaching the people who need it.</p><p>On Friday, Stéphane Dujarric, a U.N. spokesman, told reporters at a briefing that the day before, the agency and its humanitarian partners on the Palestinian side of the crossing only <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2025/db250530.doc.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">managed to receive five truckloads of cargo</a> for distribution, while 60 other trucks “had to return to the crossing due to intense hostilities in the area.”</p><p>Israel’s blockade had halted food and fuel entering Gaza since March, causing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/israel-gaza-blockade-humanitarian-crisis.html" title="">widespread hunger</a> and deprivation among Palestinians there. Aid organizations <a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-update-5-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended their operations</a> as food stockpiles <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-runs-out-food-stocks-gaza-border-crossings-remain-closed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dwindled</a>. Doctors reported malnutrition among children, and the United Nations <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/risk-famine-across-all-gaza-new-report-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently warned</a> that people across the territory were at risk of famine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Israeli officials had said the blockade was an attempt to force Hamas to surrender and release the remaining hostages held in Gaza. About 20 living hostages and the bodies of more than 30 others are believed to still be in the enclave, according to Israeli authorities. Israel says that a new aid distribution system is necessary because Hamas was diverting humanitarian aid on a grand scale — claims that could not be independently confirmed, and that the United Nations said were exaggerated.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians waiting to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mahmoud Issa/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-4a5b94db">How have Israel’s allies responded?</h2><p>The new system has raised concerns from Palestinians and the international community that the approach, which for now concentrates on sites in southern and central Gaza, will forcibly displace residents from the northern part of the territory.</p><p>On Sunday, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation pledged that its “operations will continue scaling,” adding that it has “plans to build additional sites across Gaza, including in the northern region, in the weeks ahead.”</p><p>Jonathan Whittall, a senior U.N. humanitarian official, has called Israel’s attempt to take control of aid distribution for Palestinians in Gaza part of “an assault on their human dignity.”</p><p>Britain’s minister of state for international development, Jenny Chapman, made her first visit to Israel and the West Bank in late May. In an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cjwqqnlgn1vt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with the BBC</a> in Ramallah, she said Israel was “using hunger as a weapon of war.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Having a handful of militarized sites for food distribution, rather than the hundreds previously available through established humanitarian groups, also requires many people to walk for miles and cross Israeli military cordons to obtain aid.</p><p>President Trump last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-trump-isolation.html" title="">called</a><strong> </strong>for the war to wind down, and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, subsequently presented Israel and Hamas with a new version of his proposal for a cease-fire deal. Under that proposal, Israel and Hamas would halt the fighting in Gaza for at least 60 days, during which some hostages would be freed in exchange for Palestinians jailed by Israel and there would be further talks on a permanent end to the war.</p><p>Israel said on Thursday that it had accepted the proposal. Hamas on Saturday said that it had submitted a response that aimed to achieve, among other terms, a permanent end to the fighting. This issue has long been the core sticking point in negotiations, as Israel has vowed to fight until Hamas lays down its arms and sends it leaders into exile. The White House denounced Hamas’s response on Saturday.</p><p>In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu defended the aid distribution effort, saying it would prevent Hamas from stealing supplies. The idea, he said, is to ensure that Hamas cannot loot aid and use it as a tool of war. He also said the plan was “eventually, to have a sterile zone in the south of Gaza where the entire population can move for its own protection.”</p><h2 id="link-3d4ab274">How are Palestinians in Gaza responding?</h2><p>In northern Gaza, cut off by Israeli troops from the rest of the territory, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/middleeast/gaza-children-hunger.html" title="">hundreds of thousands of people</a> are reduced to waiting for hours for charity-kitchen food that runs out too soon and to digging boreholes for water to drink, unsanitary though it might be.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>People struggle to find fuel for hospital generators, cars and cooking stoves. Families have resorted to burning wood or even trash.</p><p>The vast majority of Gaza’s residents have already been forcibly displaced at least once — many of them several times — during the war.</p><p>Even before the Israeli military’s announcement, Palestinians had started fleeing their homes to seek shelter away from the Israeli lines. Last week, Israel issued sweeping evacuation orders in and around the southern city of Khan Younis.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-15"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-05-19-gaza-israel-displaced-mawasi" data-id="100000010182163" data-source-id="100000010182163"><div slug="2025-05-19-gaza-israel-displaced-mawasi" data-sourceid="100000010182163" id="embed-id-100000010182163">
