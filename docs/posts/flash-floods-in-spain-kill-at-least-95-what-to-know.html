Some of the hardest-hit villages remain cut off, with main roads and bridges broken or still inundated.

A storm system pushed the moisture-rich clouds into Spain.</p><p>Estimating the influence of climate change on any single flood event requires further analysis, but scientists have said that global warming is making storms in many regions more intense. Warmer air holds, and releases, more water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deadly flooding left piled-up cars and muddy streets in Valencia, Spain.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manaure Quintero/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Mediterranean is also getting hotter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/climate/central-europe-floods-global-warming.html" title="">hitting its highest ever recorded</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/climate/central-europe-floods-global-warming.html" title="">temperature</a> in August.</p><p>Scientists convened by the United Nations have found no consistent trend in the way global warming is affecting extreme rainfall in the Mediterranean region, which includes Southern Europe and North Africa. But climate models indicate that if nations allow global warming to worsen in the coming decades, downpours in the region will most likely become heavier and more frequent.</p><h2 id="link-6bf5a40f">What damage have the floods caused?</h2><p>The death toll jumped throughout the day on Wednesday and could rise further on Thursday as rescuers pressed on with their search. People are still missing, and residents were urged not to travel in the area. More than 1,000 soldiers from an emergency response team were sent to affected areas. </p><p>While it has been difficult to assess the damage to homes, roads and other infrastructure as rescuers struggle to reach some areas, initial reports have made clear that it is extensive. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Along a muck-covered highway after heavy rainfall in Valencia Province.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Miguel Angel Polo/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Videos posted online show some bridges washed away, roads impassable train tracks damaged and many homes completely flooded or destroyed.
