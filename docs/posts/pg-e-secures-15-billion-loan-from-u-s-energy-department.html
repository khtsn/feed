The conditional commitment, which still has to be finalized, will help PG&amp;E invest in hydroelectric power generation, batteries and power lines.</p><p>PG&amp;E, one of the largest utilities in the country serving roughly 16 million people in Northern and Central California, is grappling with a surge of demand for electricity spurred by the shift to electric vehicles, the expansion of data centers and efforts to phase out fossil fuels. The company is also under pressure to prevent its equipment from setting off devastating fires.</p><p>“These infrastructure investments will help PG&amp;E meet forecasted load growth, increase electric reliability and reduce costs for its consumers across California,” the Energy Department said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>State regulators have also put pressure on PG&amp;E to limit rate increases for California residents, though officials have approved multiple rate increases this year.</p><p>This month, the Public Advocates Office, which represents consumers in utility rate cases before the California Public Utilities Commission, issued a <a href="https://www.publicadvocates.cpuc.ca.gov/press-room/reports-and-analyses/2024-q3-electric-rates-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> citing PG&amp;E’s rate increases as the highest among the state’s investor-owned utilities.</p><p>The report said that the utility’s rates increased 56 percent over a three-year period through October and 118 percent over the past 10 years. By comparison, Southern California Edison’s rates increased 48 percent during the three-year period and 86 percent over 10 years, and San Diego Gas and Electric’s rate rose 21 percent and 83 percent.</p><p>A variety of factors have driven PG&amp;E’s rising prices. On top of swelling electricity demand, PG&amp;E and the other utilities are facing the effects of climate change through extreme weather conditions — most notably, destructive wildfires that have wreaked havoc across California.</p><p>PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019, after a series of wildfires caused by the company’s equipment left it with billions of dollars in liability. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That year, PG&amp;E also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html" title="">pleaded guilty</a> to involuntary manslaughter over its role in the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 84 people.</p><p>In a statement, PG&amp;E said that the Energy Department’s loan guarantee could save ratepayers as much as $1 billion, in part by lowering how much it pays to borrow money. The government backing, the company said, would help advance several planned improvements, including upgrades to its hydroelectric power plants, increased use of battery storage on the grid and technology that allow its power lines to transmit more electricity.</p><p>The utility said it also wanted to expand use of home solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles in ways that would allow customers to generate, store and send power to the grid.</p><p>“The D.O.E. loan program can help us accelerate the pace and impact of this work, which supports thousands of living wage jobs, at a lower cost to our customers,” Patti Poppe, PG&amp;E’s chief executive, said in a statement.</p><p>The Loan Programs Office, which was created in 2005, has developed into an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/climate/jigar-shah-climate-biden.html" title="">engine</a> of the Biden administration’s efforts to aggressively advance clean energy. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act significantly expanded the office’s authority to provide loans to companies looking to bring emerging energy technologies to market, raising its lending capacity to more than $400 billion from $40 billion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The incoming Trump administration could, however, significantly curtail the office’s work, prompting a rush by Biden officials to offer financing to companies before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.</p><p>Other major commitments from the Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration have included a $9.6 billion loan for a battery joint venture between Ford Motor and SK On, which was finalized on Monday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div><div><p>Ivan Penn is a reporter based in Los Angeles and covers the energy industry.
