The conditional commitment, which still has to be finalized, will help PG&amp;E invest in hydroelectric power generation, batteries and power lines.</p><p>PG&amp;E, one of the largest utilities in the country serving roughly 16 million people in Northern and Central California, is grappling with a surge of demand for electricity spurred by the shift to electric vehicles, the expansion of data centers and efforts to phase out fossil fuels. The company is also under pressure to prevent its equipment from setting off devastating fires.</p><p>“These infrastructure investments will help PG&amp;E meet forecasted load growth, increase electric reliability and reduce costs for its consumers across California,” the Energy Department said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>State regulators have also put pressure on PG&amp;E to limit rate increases for California residents, though officials have approved multiple rate increases this year.</p><p>This month, the Public Advocates Office, which represents consumers in utility rate cases before the California Public Utilities Commission, issued a <a href="https://www.publicadvocates.cpuc.ca.gov/press-room/reports-and-analyses/2024-q3-electric-rates-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> citing PG&amp;E’s rate increases as the highest among the state’s investor-owned utilities.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
