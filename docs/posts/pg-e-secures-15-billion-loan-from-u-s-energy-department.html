The conditional commitment, which still has to be finalized, will help PG&amp;E invest in hydroelectric power generation, batteries and power lines.</p><p>PG&amp;E, one of the largest utilities in the country serving roughly 16 million people in Northern and Central California, is grappling with a surge demand for electricity spurred by the shift to electric vehicles, the expansion of data centers and efforts to phase out fossil fuels. The company, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2020 after racking up billions of dollars in wildfire liabilities, is also under pressure to prevent its equipment from setting off devastating fires.</p><p>“These infrastructure investments will help PG&amp;E meet forecasted load growth, increase electric reliability and reduce costs for its consumers across California,” the Energy Department said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>State regulators have also put pressure on PG&amp;E to limit rate increases for California residents, though officials have approved multiple rate increases this year.</p><p>On top of swelling electricity demand, PG&amp;E and other utilities are facing the effects of climate change through extreme weather conditions — most notably, destructive wildfires that have wreaked havoc across California. In 2020, PG&amp;E <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html" title="">pleaded guilty</a> to involuntary manslaughter over its role in the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 84 people. Grid safety projects could be funded as part of the Energy Department’s loan.</p><p>The Loan Programs Office, which was created in 2005, has developed into an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/climate/jigar-shah-climate-biden.html" title="">engine</a> of the Biden administration’s efforts to aggressively advance clean energy. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act significantly expanded the office’s authority to provide loans to companies looking to bring emerging energy technologies to market, raising its lending capacity to more than $400 billion from $40 billion.</p><p>The incoming Trump administration could, however, significantly curtail the office’s work, prompting a rush by Biden officials to offer financing to companies before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.</p><p>Other major commitments from the Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration have included a $9.6 billion loan for a battery joint venture between Ford Motor and SK On, which was finalized on Monday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
