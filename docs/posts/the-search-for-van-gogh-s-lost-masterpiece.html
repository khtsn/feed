href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/16/arts/article-985390-no-title.html" title="">set the record</a> at the time for the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction, going to a Japanese paper magnate for $82.5 million.</p><p>Painted in the garden of the artist’s physician in June 1890, it was completed just weeks before van Gogh’s suicide by gunshot. The sense of melancholy radiating from the doctor conveys, van Gogh <a href="https://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/RM23/letter.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> to his friend Paul Gauguin, the “heartbroken expression of our time.” Considered to be among his masterpieces, it may now be worth $300 million, or more, experts say.</p><p>For much of the 20th century, “Portrait of Dr. Gachet” was prominently displayed at the Städel Museum in Frankfurt and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to which it was lent by a private collector before the 1990 sale.</p><p>But it has all but disappeared since that day at Christie’s, and its whereabouts have become one of the art world’s greatest mysteries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Curators putting together van Gogh shows have thrown up their hands at finding it.

Their effort to find the Gachet — a journey taken over the years by many others — stretched from the auction houses and galleries of New York to a storybook Swiss villa alongside Lake Lugano.</p><p>Many experts encountered along the way had no clue what had happened to the painting. Four art world insiders said they suspect the painting is held by a private, very rich European family. All parties had an opinion on the core question that drives such a quest: Do collecting families have any responsibility to share iconic works of art with the broader public?</p><p>The question has grown more relevant as it becomes clearer that most museums can no longer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/arts/design/leonardo-da-vinci-salvator-mundi-christies-auction.html" title="">outbid billionaire collectors</a> for the greatest works of art. Few paintings make that point plainer than Dr. Gachet’s portrait, a piece long on public display that has now vanished into someone’s private home or a climate-controlled warehouse.</p><p>For many in the art world, such a work is not just a creative expression, but part of a trade that survives because of the interest and deep pockets of collectors who may, or may not, choose to share their work.</p><p>“People are allowed to own things privately,” said Michael Findlay, who was involved as a specialist for Christie’s in the 1990 auction sale of the Gachet. “Does it belong to everybody? No, it does not.”</p><p>But the loss is palpable to people like Cynthia Saltzman, the author of the 1998 <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/saltzman-gachet.html" title="">book</a> “Portrait of Dr. Gachet.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>She regularly viewed the painting at the Met.

When van Gogh stepped off the train there, on May 20, 1890, the rustic landscape and thatched-roof houses had already become a magnet for artists of the day. The deeply troubled artist, 37, would kill himself only weeks later. But he was about to enter one of his most productive periods during which he painted “Wheat Field With Crows” and “The Church at Auvers.”</p><p>That same day, he met with Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a doctor who had studied nervous disorders. The two shared a love of art. Van Gogh was soon painting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/29/world/asia/van-gogh-china-buyer.html" title="">still lifes</a> in the doctor’s garden — and the doctor’s portrait.</p><p>Van Gogh didn’t seek to make an accurate rendering. Cameras could perform that task by then; instead he depicted what he saw in the doctor, and in himself.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“I’ve done the portrait of M. Gachet with a melancholy expression, which might well seem like a grimace to those who see it,” van Gogh <a href="https://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let886/letter.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in June 1890. “And yet I had to paint it like that to convey how much expression and passion there is in our present-day heads in comparison with the old calm portraits, and how much longing and crying out.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The former home of Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bertrand Guay/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Van Gogh gave a second version of the painting to Dr. Gachet. It is <a href="https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/artworks/le-docteur-paul-gachet-751" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on display</a> at the Musee d’Orsay in Paris.</p><p>“To me it reveals Vincent’s strong humanistic impulse and his capacity for love,” said Gary Tinterow, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. He was the Met’s curator of 19th-century European paintings in 1990 when the portrait was taken off the wall to be auctioned.</p><p>After van Gogh’s suicide, the painting passed to his brother Theo, then to Theo’s wife, Johanna, who sold it 1897 for 300 francs (about $58 at the time). By 1904, it was in the hands of a German count, who had paid roughly $400 for it.</p><p>Van Gogh’s fame grew after his death, perhaps nowhere more than Germany. In 1911, the Städel acquired the portrait and placed it alongside greats like Dürer, elevating van Gogh to their level. The Gachet soon ranked among the museum’s most prized works.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>When the Nazis took power in the 1930s, though, they fueled a conservative pushback that disdained modern art’s bold break from straightforward pictorial representation. Works by van Gogh and other artists were labeled “degenerate,” so the museum tried to protect them by keeping them in a locked room under its roof.</p><p>When the Nazis began confiscating the art they despised, the Gachet escaped the first seizure in 1937. But by the end of the year it had been taken and sent to Berlin.</p><p>Months later, an art agent for Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering sold the Gachet to Franz Koenigs, a German banker living in Amsterdam. Its next owner, a German-Jewish banker, Siegfried Kramarsky, brought the portrait to New York when he emigrated, and for decades, on and off, the painting was displayed at the Met, typically in the summers when the Kramarskys were away, Tinterow recalled.

For one thing, the auction house sold the work.
