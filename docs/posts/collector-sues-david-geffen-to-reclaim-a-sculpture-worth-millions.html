Nagy, released a statement in which he characterized Mr. Sun’s claims in the lawsuit as “bizarre and baseless” and suggested Mr. Sun simply wanted to undo the deal.</p><p>“We call that seller’s remorse,” the statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David Geffen bought the Giacometti sculpture in 2024. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images For Vogue</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the lawsuit, Mr. Sun’s lawyers said that two art dealers and their lawyer working with Mr. Geffen, a leading art collector and philanthropist, should have asked questions about “obvious red flags” concerning the legitimacy of the sale before proceeding. They described one of those “flags” as the fact that the supposed lawyer was communicating through a personal gmail account rather than a more professional address.</p><p>“Defendants either must restitute it or pay very substantial damages to Plaintiff,” lawyers for Mr. Sun said of the sculpture, according to the suit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Sun drew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/arts/design/cattelan-banana-sothebys-auction.html" title="">wide public attention</a> in the art world last year when he paid $6.2 million for a work consisting of a fresh banana stuck to a wall with duct tape. He subsequently ate the banana. (The banana was the center of a 2019 conceptual artwork, “Comedian,” by the noted artist prankster Maurizio Cattelan. It comes with a certificate of authenticity and installation instructions for owners to replace the banana — if they wish — on the wall whenever it rots.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Justin Sun, a crypto entrepreneur and avid art collector, bought the conceptual artwork “Comedian” in 2024 for $6.2 million.

But the court papers say he never gave his adviser the authority to negotiate a deal, only to make inquiries.</p><p>The suit says that, nonetheless, the adviser negotiated a deal with Mr. Geffen’s representatives for less than what Mr. Sun was seeking. Under the deal, according to the court papers, Mr. Geffen turned over two artworks — together worth, according to the court papers, $55 million — plus another $10.5 million in cash, in exchange for the Giacometti.</p><p>“Plaintiff never would have agreed to such a transaction had he been told about it — Plaintiff had expressed interest only in selling Le Nez for a profit over what he paid and in an all-cash (or equivalent) deal,” his lawyers said in the court papers.</p><p>But in his statement, Mr. Nagy, the lawyer for Mr. Geffen, suggested that Mr. Sun had been cognizant of the deal. “Mr. Sun received two paintings and $10.5 million for the sculpture he sold,” the statement said. “After trying and failing to sell the paintings, he now wants to retrade the deal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Mr. Sun’s lawsuit, his lawyers said that he did not realize that the sculpture had been sold until many months after Mr. Geffen bought it. The suit says the art adviser used the cash turned over in the Geffen deal to suggest to Mr. Sun that she had found a collector interested in the sculpture who had put down a $10 million deposit. They say in the filing that she then forwarded that sum to Mr. Sun and kept the remaining $500,000 for herself.</p><p>Mr. Sun’s lawsuit says he only uncovered the scheme last December when he went back to the adviser and questioned her about the lack of progress on that deal. The lawyers said they then reached out to Mr. Geffen’s representatives, but were told he was not returning the work.</p><p>Zachary Small contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Graham Bowley is an investigative reporter covering the world of culture for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/graham-bowley">More about Graham Bowley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/david-geffen">David Geffen</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/alberto-giacometti">Alberto Giacometti</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
