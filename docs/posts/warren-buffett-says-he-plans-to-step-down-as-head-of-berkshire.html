    <h1>Warren Buffett Says He Plans to Step Down as Head of Berkshire</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warren E. Buffett has been at the forefront of American capitalism for decades as the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he built into a $1.1 trillion colossus.</p><p>By the end of the year, he is preparing to give up that role.</p><p>Mr. Buffett said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday that he plans to ask Berkshire’s board to approve making Gregory Abel, his heir apparent, the chief executive by the end of the year.</p><p>“I would still hang around and conceivably be useful in a few cases,” Mr. Buffett, 94, told the tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders at the meeting in Omaha, the company’s headquarters. But Mr. Abel would have “the final word” when it comes to the company’s operations, how it invests and more.</p><p>Mr. Buffett’s plan — which he said had been known only to two of his children who sit on the company’s board, Howard and Susan Buffett — was greeted by a minute-long standing ovation by Berkshire shareholders.</p></div></div>
