    <h1>Tim Cook to Dine With Trump at Mar-a-Lago</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump has been receptive to those appeals in the past. During <a href="https://youtu.be/-dmwG54QsKc?feature=shared" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a podcast interview in October,</a> Mr. Trump said he listened sympathetically as Mr. Cook complained to him on a call last month about European regulators who have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/business/apple-eu-fine-app-store.html" title="">fined Apple $2 billion</a> for using the App Store to thwart competition. </p><p>“I’m not going to let them take advantage of our companies,” Mr. Trump recalled telling Mr. Cook. “That won’t be happening.”</p><p>Mr. Cook has become something of a model for corporate executives looking to stay on good terms with Mr. Trump. During Mr. Trump’s first term, the president heaped praise on Mr. Cook, saying that he liked that Mr. Cook called him directly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/technology/apple-tim-cook-china.html" title="">to discuss business and economic issues</a>. The approach helped Mr. Cook build a personal relationship with Mr. Trump and helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/apple-watch-tariffs.html" title="">Apple avoid tariffs</a> on many of its products, even as the Trump administration cracked down on other companies manufacturing in China.</p><p>In contrast, other tech giants have spent the last month working to repair damage in their relationships with Mr. Trump. In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Pichai, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump next week. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/meta-trump-inaugural-fund-donation.html" title="">Meta</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/amazon-trump-inauguration.html" title="">Amazon</a> also said that they would donate $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural fund. </p><p>In 2017, Mr. Cook started to build a relationship with the Trump administration by getting to know Mr. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner. He would often call them to talk about policy matters and the potential ramifications of issues like tariffs on Apple.<span>  </span></p></div></div>
