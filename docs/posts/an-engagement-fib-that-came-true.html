After they messaged one another, he suggested a first date at the Library Bar at the NoMad Hotel, now known as the Ned NoMad, in Manhattan’s NoMad neighborhood.</p><p>“He didn’t know it was one of my favorites,” Ms. Seim said.</p><p>“I remember her walking in the door looking exactly like her pictures — always a plus when you meet people online,” he said. “She was dressed to the nines.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“He looked so handsome,” she said. “He had this James Bond look, and he had this really warm smile. I was worried he might be dull. But he was instantly funny.

But they kept up “quite the texting rapport,” Ms. Seim said.</p><p>Three months into dating, their relationship took a turn. “We had been on four or five dates and everything seemed to be going well,” Ms. Seim said. Then she received a text from him in mid-August: He said he was dealing with some family issues and couldn’t date anyone. “I was really shocked and disappointed,” she said, but added that she earnestly wished him well.</p><p>Ms. Seim, 47, who is from Bellevue, Neb., has written children’s novels like “Horse Girl” (Penguin Random House), which is currently being developed for television with producing partner Zosia Mamet, the Audible Original series “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/parenting/best-audiobooks-road-trips-kids.html" title="">The Flying Flamingo Sisters</a>” and the upcoming “Horse Camp: A Horse Girl Mystery.” She is also a freelance television writer; a freelance journalist (who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/fashion/the-hail-mary-moon.html" title="">has</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/style/summer-sabbatical-creative-hiatus.html" title="">written</a> for The New York Times); and an actor who has appeared on “Inside Amy Schumer” and many TV commercials.

Ms. Seim had arranged a dinner for them with friends and actually fibbed about celebrating her engagement in order to get a reservation at Nobu Malibu.</p><p>“It can be impossible to get a table there,” she said, adding that she “knew we would be getting engaged in some months.”</p><p>Ms. Seim slipped a costume ring on her left ring finger to complete the ruse.

The wedding party included Ms. Seim’s sister, Lindsay Seim, and Mr. Adams’s three children.</p><p>The bride wore three dresses: the Swan by Esteé Couture for the ceremony; a secondhand white flapper dress with heavy beading and feather trim by Nadine Merabi for the first dance; and a mini dress by Nicole + Felicia for the after-party.</p><p>“I come from a sketch-comedy background,” said Ms. Seim, who is an alumna of the Groundlings Sunday Company in Los Angeles, “and love a costume change.”</p><p>The groom wore a Michael Andrews Bespoke tuxedo with a white dinner jacket, along with vintage Chanel cuff links, with the interlocking “C” motif representing Carrie and Clarke, a gift from the bride.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“I have a large family and we were all together in one place for the first time in many years,” Mr. Adams said. “I can’t imagine that it was easy, but from the beginning Carrie has always fit in perfectly with my rambunctious crew.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>For the first dance, Ms. Seim wore a secondhand white flapper dress with heavy beading and feather trim by Nadine Merabi. “I come from a sketch-comedy background and love a costume change,” she said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evan Rich Photography</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><hr/><h3 id="link-52899010"><span>On this Day</span></h3><p><strong>When</strong> Feb. 15, 2025</p><p><strong>Where</strong> The Palms Hotel &amp; Spa, Miami Beach</p><p><strong>Medical Miracle</strong> Last March, Ms. Seim’s mother, Sharon Seim, had a stroke and was “given only a 10 percent chance of survival,” said Ms. Seim, who spent several months in Florida helping with her care. “When my mom was in a coma and on a vent and feeding tube, they put a ‘recovery goal’ in her room,’” Ms. Seim said. “My sister wrote, ‘Go to Carrie’s wedding.’”</p><p>Not only did Ms. Seim’s mother make it to the wedding and walk Ms. Seim down the aisle along with her father, Donald Seim, but, the bride added, “my mom, who has only been able to walk on her own for a few months, started grooving on the dance floor with me, my dad and my sister.”</p><p><strong>Going For the Laugh</strong> “My ceremony gown was on the ginormous side, including an impressively long train. As I made my way down the staircase solo, I could feel the crowd palpably holding their breaths, worried I was about to trip and fall on my face in front of 100 of my loved ones,” Ms. Seim said. “So, I faked an off-kilter wobble and got a big laugh, which I think lifted the tension and got us off to a fun start.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>Love’s a Puzzle</strong> Mr. Adams’s older son, Colin, designs crosswords puzzles — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2025/02/21" title="">including some</a> for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2025/01/03" title="">The New York Times</a>. “He created a custom, giant crossword with clues about us for guests to solve during cocktail hour,” Ms. Seim said.</p><p><strong>It Takes All Kinds</strong> The guest list included people with a vast array of professions. As the officiant shared during the ceremony, those in attendance included, “writers, financiers, actors, authors, doctors, nurses, EMTs, attorneys, directors, teachers, students, volunteers, entrepreneurs, musicians, crossword puzzle constructors, beekeepers — on both sides of the family — and even a couple of puppeteers and a sea lion trainer,” Mr. Clark said. “Please find each other during cocktail hour.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>ST</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>An Engagement Fib That Turned Out to Be True<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
