It is also well known as a city where Hezbollah holds sway. But unlike other places where the group enjoys support, Baalbek has largely been spared Israeli bombardment.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1851553780921155965" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted online on Wednesday, Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman, signaled that this would no longer be the case. He posted a map showing the city and two neighboring towns, Ain Bourday and Douris, as part of a danger zone marked in red, with three evacuation routes authorized by the Israeli military.</p><p>“The I.D.F. will act forcefully against Hezbollah interests within your city and villages and does not intend to harm you,” Mr. Adraee said. “For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and move outside the city and villages.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The evacuation warning comes two days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon-baalbek-bekaa-valley.html" title="">Israeli airstrikes killed at least 60 people</a> in the Bekaa district, which includes the city and its rural hinterland, Lebanese officials said. Lebanon’s health ministry said at least 58 others were injured in the attacks.</p><p>As people in Baalbek received the evacuation warnings by text message late Wednesday morning, a sense of alarm seized the streets of the city, according to Ibrahim Bayan, a deputy to the mayor in Baalbek.</p><p>“People are panicking,” Mr. Bayan said. “They are running around and bumping into each other, like chickens with their heads cut off. They have no idea what to do, where to go.”</p><p>Within minutes, the roads filled with residents who threw their valuables into plastic bags, locked their houses and pulled metal grates over their shop doors, he said. As people crammed into cars, they shouted to each other to determine the safest way to leave the city.</p><p>The warning from Israel’s military included a village in Baalbek’s southern suburbs that connects the city to the region’s main highway, cutting off a standard route for residents trying to leave the valley.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah continued elsewhere in Lebanon. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had struck more than 100 sites across the country in the previous 24 hours, including a rocket launch site used in a deadly strike on the Israeli town of Ma’alot-Tarshiha on Tuesday.</p><p>Hezbollah said its forces had battled Israeli troops in recent days near the border town of Kfar Kila and the mountain town of Khiam, which is well known in Lebanon as the former site of a prison camp run by allies of Israel during its two-decade occupation of southern Lebanon. The claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>The camp was turned into a museum by the Lebanese government after Israel withdrew in 2000, although it was later destroyed by an Israeli airstrike during the 2006 war in Lebanon.</p><p>Jacob Roubai<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel Bans UNRWA:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s Parliament passed two laws that could threaten the work of the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-ban-gaza.html">barring its operations in the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Arrests in Yemen:</strong><strong> </strong>The Iran-backed Houthi militia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/houthi-militia-arrests-spying-us.html">detained dozens of Yemenis</a> linked to the U.S. Embassy or international organizations recently, alarming diplomats and aid workers in the country.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran-Israel Tensions:</strong><strong> </strong>Iran’s leaders emphasized that they had a right to respond to Israel’s airstrikes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/world/middleeast/israel-iran.html">but appeared to take a measured tone</a>, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that the assault had achieved its objectives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran’s Nuclear Push:</strong><strong> </strong>With Iran’s Russian-produced air defenses in smoldering piles after Israel’s strikes, experts fear the Iranian leaders may conclude they have only one defense left: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/iran-israel-strikes-tehran.html">racing for an atomic weapon</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Murals in Tehran:</strong><strong> </strong>In the Iranian capital’s Palestine Square, a series of murals have telegraphed warnings to Israel. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/iran-israel-war-tehran-murals.html">Here are some of the murals that have appeared in recent months</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
