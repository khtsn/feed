The boys spoke through a Romanian translator, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98p0696r4do" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC reported</a>, and both denied the charges through their lawyer.</p><p>The case triggered an outcry in the town, and tapped into a broader anti-immigrant movement that has resulted in several outbreaks of violence in recent years. Far-right groups and influencers on social media amplified news of the assault case and celebrated the ensuing riots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Northern Ireland has seen increased immigration in recent years, with the percentage of the population born outside of the United Kingdom rising from 6.5 percent in 2011 to 8.6 percent in 2021, according to the most recent <a href="https://www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/RS158_0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">census data</a>. But the number of immigrants is still <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgm7vn2kegjo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relatively low</a> compared with many other countries in Europe, and emigration is high.

The report’s author concluded that a “disturbing pattern of locally driven racist and anti-immigrant activity in Northern Ireland” was being escalated by international extremists who were amplifying “fabricated narratives” on social media.</p><p>Dessie Donnelly, the author of the report, told The New York Times that some previous incidents had been sparked by criminal incidents involving migrants, while others “had all the hallmarks of made-up stories.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“There is a deliberate strategy to build a narrative of incidents being perpetrated by the ‘other’ — the immigrant communities — against ‘our’ communities,” he said. “Suddenly a lot of the crime, like sexual offenses, attempted abductions of children, are all laid at the doorstep of this immigrant ‘other’ living in our community. Whether these incidents are true or false doesn’t really seem to matter online.”</p><p>Mr. Donnelly, who works for a Belfast-based technology research group, The Rabble Coop, said that police and government statistics showed that the “vast majority” of sex crimes in Northern Ireland were carried out by white men from the country, but that extremist messaging presenting migrants as a threat was “finding fertile ground.”</p><p>According to the most recent Northern Ireland census, 16 percent of Ballymena residents recorded a national identity outside British, Irish and Northern Irish groups in 2021, up from 10 percent at the previous census in 2011.</p><p>The largest nationality in the “other” group was Romanian in the most recent census, followed by Polish, Bulgarian and Slovakian.</p><p>Five people were arrested on suspicion of rioting in Ballymena on Tuesday night, while another suspect was arrested on suspicion of disorder in Newtownabbey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The police are also investigating a Molotov cocktail attack in the village of Cullybackey, around three miles away from Ballymena, shortly after midnight on Tuesday.</p><p>A vehicle was set on fire and a nearby property, with a woman and two children inside, was damaged, in what investigators are treating as a racially motivated hate crime.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
