Ms. Goldberg’s co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Alyssa Farah Griffin paused, stricken, forks frozen halfway to their mouths. Another co-host, Sara Haines, spit a forkful of the dessert back onto her plate.</p><p>Ms. Goldberg, a native New Yorker, explained that the bakery had turned away her order, citing an equipment problem. But the bakery accepted the same order, this time placed with no mention of her name, a few days later, according to a person familiar with both pastry orders.</p><p>“Perhaps they did not like my politics,” said Ms. Goldberg, a Democratic stalwart who, along with the five other hosts of “The View,” <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/the-view-whoopi-goldberg-refuses-trump-name-election-win-1236202564/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed Kamala Harris.</a></p><p>Ms. Goldberg did not name the bakery on air. But viewers recognized the packaging — a <a href="https://citylore.org/taste-charlotte-russe-from-holtermanns-bakery/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">red polka-dot cardboard cup</a> — as the work of Holtermann’s, which is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/nyregion/holtermanns-bakery-staten-island-bread.html" title="">operated out of a weathered storefront</a> in the Great Kills neighborhood by the great-grandchildren of Claus Holtermann, who founded the bakery in 1878.

Trump trounced Ms. Harris</a> by more than 30 percentage points, Ms. Goldberg’s umbrage has been a windfall for the bakery.</p><p>On Friday, the island’s Republican borough president, Vito Fossella, held a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCaKhhoyPwW/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news conference outside the store</a> to “stand up for one of the best families and businesses not just Staten Island but this country would appreciate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He called on Ms. Goldberg to apologize: “Just say you’re sorry so we can put this behind us and look forward to a great Thanksgiving and keeping this country great again.”</p><p>On Saturday afternoon, the line snaked out the door. People had come from as far away as Philadelphia. Coffee danish rings, cupcakes and coconut custard pies in old-school blue-and-white boxes flew off the shelves.
