screen broadcasting the match inside, the all-American men’s semifinal between Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz.</p><p>Many didn’t have tickets to be inside Arthur Ashe, but they were content just to be nearby and part of the atmosphere. Fans at the U.S. Open have been abuzz this week, excited that for the first time in more than two decades both an American man and an American woman will play in the U.S. Open singles finals.</p><p>Jessica Pegula will play Aryna Sabalenka in the women’s final on Saturday afternoon, and Taylor Fritz will take on Jannik Sinner for the men’s title on Sunday.</p><p>With Americans’ presence guaranteed in the finals, the grounds at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens have felt almost like the Fourth of July. Fans have been cheering more loudly than usual for American players, flocking to practices to catch a glimpse of their favorites and draping themselves in red, white and blue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The last time the United States was represented in the men’s and women’s finals at the U.S. Open was in 2002. That year, the finals were an all-American affair with Pete Sampras defeating Andre Agassi in the men’s final, and Serena Williams taking the women’s title in a match against her sister, Venus Williams.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Houston Bigelow of Washington, D.C., wore his support on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ginny DeHart, left, and Jen Otto traveled from Mississippi for the Open.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This year, fans said, has felt like the culmination of a moment that has been building in American tennis, especially after Coco Gauff won the U.S. Open last year.</p><p>Velvor Rhone, who lives in Manhattan, has been at the U.S. Open to watch Arthur Ashe, Sloane Stephens, Coco Gauff and both the Williams sisters win titles. She said the future of American tennis was “definitely promising.”</p><p>“I’m hoping that I get to watch Frances Tiafoe get his win at the U.S. Open,” she said on Friday afternoon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The party at the Open started last week, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/nyregion/us-open-crowds.html" title="">recording-breaking crowds over the first five days</a> of the tournament, and the excitement around the Americans has been building to a fever pitch. On Thursday night, two American women were in the semifinals: Ms. Pegula and Emma Navarro, who was born in New York.</p><p>Throughout the night on Thursday, the crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium rallied behind the two American women, coming to life whenever either hit a winner or held a match. At times, the crowd even cheered when the non-American opponents lost a point.</p><p>Ms. Navarro ultimately lost to Ms. Sabalenka, who told reporters after the match that she had to contend with a crowd that seemed to favor a Navarro win.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maya and Jacob Schneider were able to get a photo with Taylor Fritz after his practice session on Friday afternoon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“They’re cheering for her, but how can they help her to win the match?” Ms. Sabalenka said on Thursday night. “Only if I let them get into my head.” She added that the loudness of the stadium could be “the trickiest.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Friday afternoon, before the two American men took the court in Arthur Ashe to duel for a spot in the final, fans across the grounds were already eager to support the Americans.</p><p>Jen Otto, 50, and Ginny DeHart, 47, of Mississippi, showed their allegiance sartorially. Ms. Otto wore an American flag sweater, while Ms. DeHart’s blue shirt was printed with “U.S.A.” in red, white and blue lettering. She also wore red, white and blue earrings that looked like two strands of fireworks, dangling from her ears.</p><p>“Hey!” Ms. DeHart yelled. “We’re from the U.S.A.! We’re trying to make sure everyone knows we’re proud!” She then launched into her own rendition of “God Bless the U.S.A.,” the Lee Greenwood hit.</p><p>“I love our country,” Ms. Otto said. “We love Tiafoe, and we love Fritz.

This is history tonight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Dozens of fans flocked to the practice courts on Friday afternoon to catch a glimpse of both men hours before their match.
