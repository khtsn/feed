And while Leopold said the current political climate did not inspire the exhibition, it opens when antisemitism is rising in the United States and abroad, and when American popular culture has been turning to visual mediums to resurrect the memory of the Holocaust: fact-inspired dramas like the television mini-series “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/arts/television/we-were-the-lucky-ones-logan-lerman.html" title="">We Were the Lucky Ones</a>” and the movie “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/movies/survivor-harry-haft.html" title="">The Survivor</a>” and award-winning recent fictional films like “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/movies/the-brutalist-architecture-set-design.html" title="">The Brutalist</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/arts/real-pain-eisenberg-holocaust-third-generation.html" title="">A Real Pain</a>.”</p><p>“Anne Frank the Exhibition” is the answer of the Anne Frank House to “how this history, how this memory will go into the 21st century,” Leopold said.</p><p>Following a chronological path, the installation traces Anne and her family from the 1920s in Frankfurt, Germany, through their flight to Amsterdam. It is only after exploring this early history that visitors encounter the reconstructed annex: five shadowy rooms whose exact dimensions and details the exhibition team has copied from their original location in the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, down to the covered windows and bits of peeling wallpaper.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One room in the exhibition displays 79 published editions of Anne Frank’s “The Diary of a Young Girl,” translated into dozens of languages.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yael Malka for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The show goes on to chronicle the return from Auschwitz of Otto Frank, Anne’s father and the sole survivor among the eight hidden Jews. Visitors discover how Otto learned the fates of his wife and two daughters and how he pursued the publication of Anne’s diary: 79 editions in different languages are on display, along with memorabilia from the theatrical and film adaptations. He also secured the preservation of the annex in Amsterdam, now <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/museum/inside-museum/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a museum space</a> that admits some 1.2 million visitors annually.</p><p>“We all know that the diary is about the two years in hiding,” Tom Brink, the head of collections and presentations at the Amsterdam house and the traveling exhibition’s curator, said in an interview. “But of course, the story is much bigger than that. It starts earlier, it ends later, and that entire story and entire journey deserves to be told.”</p><p>Working with <a href="https://ericgoossens.nl/musea/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eric Goossens</a>, the exhibition’s designer, Brink confronted the challenge of relating that history more than 3,600 miles away from the real annex, tucked into the back of the canal-side house where Otto Frank ran his business. In Amsterdam, the annex is completely empty except for some material on the walls, including Anne’s pictures of movie stars and artworks.</p><p>Otto Frank requested that the spaces, plundered by the Nazis, remain vacant, their barrenness attesting to profound loss. But using his and others’ accounts, the New York exhibition’s team has filled each annex room with furniture and possessions, including books and a board game retrieved from the original space.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Anne Frank’s room in the reconstructed annex features facsimiles of the photos and postcards she put up on the walls, including images of movie stars and artworks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yael Malka for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Otherwise, it would just be four walls,” Brink said. “In Amsterdam, it’s just four walls, but it’s more than just four walls. It’s the fact that you’re in the actual place. That is not the case here.”</p><p>The re-creation, however, may lead to controversy. The novelist and essayist <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/becoming-anne-frank-180970542/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dara Horn</a>, for instance, has asserted that any Anne Frank exhibition inevitably cheapens and commercializes the girl’s memory, turning her into a symbol of easy uplift.</p><p><a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/our_people/mueller_agnes.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Agnes Mueller</a>, a professor and a fellow in Jewish Studies at the University of South Carolina and a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin, has similar concerns. “My instinct says that when Otto Frank wanted the annex to be empty in the original Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, he was worried about that kind of commercialization and universalization of the persona of Anne Frank, and so he actually emphasized absence as a way to represent that which is not representable,” she said in a video interview. The sight of an annex room filled with homey touches, she added, “might induce us to feel way too good about things that we should not feel good about.”</p><p>Many items in the recreated annex, however, are wrenching, as they reveal its occupants’ expectations for an unrealized future. Anne Frank, 13 when she went into hiding, took her diary — a facsimile is here; the original remains in Amsterdam — and <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/main-characters/peter-van-pels/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peter van Pels</a>, the teenage boy who briefly won her heart, took his cat (a model of the pet carrier is in the reconstructed spaces) and his bicycle (also a reproduction). In his parents’ room, his mother, Auguste, hung a festive black dress, an original artifact never before displayed and now in the show.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of part of the reconstructed room that belonged to Hermann and Auguste van Pels.

Since the exhibition, which she has not seen, is intended to bring Holocaust history to future generations — more than 250 school tours have already been booked — it could lead “toward a better understanding of what the Holocaust might have been,” she said. (American knowledge of those events is poor; <a href="https://www.claimscon.org/millennial-study/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one 2020 survey of millennials and members of Generation Z</a> revealed that almost half could not name a single concentration camp or Nazi-era Jewish ghetto.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The show does not neglect the horror. Although a smiling photo of Anne is at the entrance, the exhibition’s audio guide — included with <a href="https://www.annefrankexhibit.org/visit" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tickets</a> — begins by giving away the story’s unhappy ending: The Nazis discovered the annex’s occupants and arrested them.</p><p>Containing more than 100 original artifacts, the installation features quotations from the Franks, along with objects from their personal histories: furniture, friendship albums, correspondence, a Torah. The display rooms chronicle the political climate of the 1920s and ’30s. A blown-up image of a 1938 Nazi rally appears repeatedly on the walls, its cheering participants teenage girls no older than Anne and her sister, Margot.</p><p>Another introductory room recreates the atmosphere of Amsterdam in 1940-42. On a continuous loop, a montage of film and photos covers the walls, interspersing scenes of family life with images including roundups of Jews, deportation trains and anti-Jewish regulations that “kept coming and kept coming,” Brink said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The room that visitors come to right after the reconstructed annex has an illuminated glass floor with a map of Europe beneath it.

Through online resources, he added, “our expectation is that we will be able to support another half a million students in their classrooms.”</p><p>Public programs will also offer adults additional perspectives on Anne Frank, whether it’s “the debates about the play from 1955, or the film of ’59, or any number of other present-day political debates about her legacy,” said <a href="https://www.cjh.org/about/leadership-gavriel-rosenfeld" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gavriel Rosenfeld</a>, president of the Center for Jewish History.

The center will also host a film series.
