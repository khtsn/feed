I-5.</p><p>Then a neighbor called with miraculous news: Her century old Mission-style stucco house was still standing and all but unharmed.</p><p>A fire crew had managed to save her home and two neighboring ones, Ms. Perez said.

For the owners of the homes that manage to skirt fate, elation can turn to grief and frustration.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this Altadena neighborhood, a few homes remained standing amid the ruin.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The lucky often find themselves alone in a neighborhood stripped of friendly faces and beloved landmarks. They fight with insurance companies to cover toxic smoke or other expensive damage, and they are left out of much of the financial and emotional support bestowed upon those who lost everything. The road ahead is long, isolating, costly and often traumatic, plagued by feelings of guilt and shame.</p><p>While many stay and rebuild, others leave because the place they called home — with neighbors who watered their plants or watched their children — is gone, even if their house isn’t.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The single standing home did not win,” said Jen Goodlin, the executive director of the Rebuild Paradise Foundation, an organization founded after the 2018 Camp Fire, which burned 153,000 acres and destroyed 18,000 structures in Northern California. “They may have their memories and possessions, but for many of them, their journey was much harder.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Perez and her neighbors continued to fend off embers on Wednesday, dousing trees and shrubs with water.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Monica Perez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Eaton fire, which ripped through Ms. Perez’s neighborhood, has destroyed more than 7,000 structures around Pasadena and Altadena, making it the second-most destructive wildfire in California’s history. With their house intact, Ms. Perez and her son and husband spent the day, with their neighbors, continuing to put out embers in trees and shrubs, keeping the flames at bay from the few remaining homes.</p><p>Ms. Perez described her neighbors as tight-knit in a city known for its transience. “Every single person you talk to is like, ‘I grew up in that house. My mother still lives in that house. We’ve been here for two generations,’” she said. “It’s a really old place.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The view from Ms. Perez’s backyard.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Monica Perez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Even a tight-knit community can vanish in a matter of hours. In November 2018, the day after the Camp Fire destroyed nearly all of Paradise, Josh Fisher, a firefighter with Cal Fire who had been battling the blaze, sent his wife Holly Fisher a video from their backyard. Their three-bedroom home had survived.</p><p>Ms. Fisher, 39, a registered nurse, who was staying with family in nearby Chico, broke down in tears. “I felt super grateful, but also guilty — you know, people lost their lives,” she said of a fire that killed 84 people.</p><p>She also worried that her neighbors would think her husband had saved their home at the expense of others. “He was trapped himself at a parking lot with hundreds of people trying to stay alive,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Fisher found the recovery process a “nightmare” of endless repairs and arguments with her insurance company.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andri Tambunan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Fisher’s house has been restored as the neighborhood around her rebuilds.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andri Tambunan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In the weeks and months that followed, Ms. Fisher, who’d lived in Paradise almost her entire life, found herself and her family in a precarious position. Her two brothers, her parents and her father-in-law had all lost their homes. Her house was standing, but unlivable: The inside was covered in an inch of ash — thick enough that Ms. Fisher’s lips tingled and her mouth tasted of soot. The roof, flooring, windows and appliances needed to be replaced, and the walls shellacked and repainted. Insulation and ductwork had been damaged, as had the deck.</p><p>“It kept going on and on and we kept finding things,” she said of damages that ultimately totaled over $200,000. “It was a very long, tedious process with insurance because everything was an argument.”</p><p>The aid that poured into the town was not intended for homeowners in her situation, she said.</p><p>She considered leaving a community where more than 90 percent of the homes were destroyed. “Do I want to go back and live in this area that was beautiful and was a nice neighborhood and now there’s nothing?” she said. But her husband still had a job there, and “If we don’t go back, like, where would we go?” she said. So in 2020, she and her husband and two children returned to a hollowed out community, and have watched it slowly come back to life.</p><p>Hillary Anaya, 43, a cosmetologist who also grew up in Paradise, moved back in to her two-bedroom house five months after the Camp Fire, partly because her insurance company wouldn’t pay for temporary lodging once the house once was deemed habitable.</p><p>She has no idea how her house was spared — a neighbor told her that someone saw flames jump over it, she said — even as her brother, sister, parents and grandmother lost their homes. Returning to a barren landscape with neither property nor people was eerie and surreal. Debris still clogged the streets, and from her front window, the view wasn’t of her neighbor’s house, but of a burned-out chimney stack and rubble. “You’d go to bed at night and there was no lights that you could see,” she said. “It could be creepy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Once a neighborhood starts to rebuild, the residents who have returned find themselves living in an endless construction site. Jenn Kaaoush and her husband and two of their children moved back in to their house three weeks after the Marshall Fire tore through the Boulder, Colo., suburbs in 2021, destroying more than 1,000 homes. Though the space had been cleaned, the air inside irritated their eyes and throats. Environmental testing found that the dust was toxic, so the walls, floors and furniture had to be removed, a process that was ultimately covered by insurance, and cost $170,000.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-20"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/10/lasthouse1-19030-cover/lasthouse1-19030-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In Superior, Colo., Jenn Kaaoush only learned that her house had survived the 2021 Marshall fire when she hiked into her neighborhood the day after the fire.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>When the family returned six months later, the landscape was still covered in debris, and most of the people who’d lived there were gone. Houses on their side of the block had largely been spared, but the other side and the rest of the neighborhood hadn’t been as fortunate. Once the rebuilding began around them, plots that had been homes where her children played became work sites with bulldozers and other heavy machinery.</p><p>“When it first happens, you say, ‘This is amazing, they’re rebuilding, our neighbors are coming home. They’re going to come home.’ But after three years, I’m like, ‘Oh my God, can you please stop building things?’” said Ms. Kaaoush, a real estate agent and city councilwoman in Superior, a town in Boulder County.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Kaaoush outside her Superior, Colo., home, which suffered severe smoke damage. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chet Strange for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Ms. Kaaoush said that she and some neighbors whose houses were also spared but ravaged by smoke rarely spoke about the strain they were under. “People with smoke damage keep a cover or lid on their emotional needs because they feel like it’s a second-tier trauma,” she said.</p><p>Jennifer Gray Thompson, the chief executive of After the Fire, a nonprofit helping communities recovering from massive wildfires, said the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/well/california-wildfire-mental-health.html" title="">toll on mental health</a> is common. “The survivors’ guilt is massive,” she said. “Whether or not they lost their home, every single person from that community is going to be traumatized.”</p><p>For some homeowners, the survival of their property wasn’t enough to keep them tied to a community that turned to ash. Dan and Pam Nelson moved to Lahaina, in Maui, in 2021, hoping to retire there. Mr. Nelson, a California firefighter, would fly back to Sacramento for his 48-hour shifts every week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-25"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/11/LASTHOUSE2-11468-cover/LASTHOUSE2-11468-cover-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Mr. Nelson stayed behind to protect his home, but said ultimately it was luck, not his efforts, that spared it.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Every morning, the couple would sit on the deck of their three-bedroom home and watch the whales in the Pacific. Then the 2023 wildfire tore through the Lahaina community, destroying more than 2,200 structures in a matter of hours. Mr. Nelson stayed behind to defend his property, but said it was only luck — the winds shifted — that saved it. After the fire, the ocean view was clouded by destruction and the community erased. By October 2023, the couple had moved to Utah, near Ms. Nelson’s brother. “It’s not healthy to live in the soot and ash,” Mr. Nelson, 47, said.</p><p>Last March, they sold the house to a neighbor whose home across the street had burned.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ronda Kaysen, a real estate reporter for The Times, writes about the intersection of housing and society.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
