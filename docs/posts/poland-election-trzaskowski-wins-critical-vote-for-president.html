The two men are set to compete in a runoff on June 1.</p><p>If the exit polls are confirmed by the official vote count, Mr. Trzaskowski could face an uphill struggle in the runoff, given that two far-right candidates appear to have finished third and fourth on Sunday, together getting around 21 percent of the vote. That means that, in total, the leading right-wing candidates won more than half of the vote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a speech to supporters on Sunday evening, Mr. Trzaskowski acknowledged that “there is much work ahead of us.”</p><p>While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial, it has veto powers that can complicate the work of the sitting government. That means that the election on Sunday has been closely watched as an important test of Mr. Tusk’s ability to unravel the legacy of the Law and Justice party, which was ousted in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/europe/poland-election-law-and-justice.html" title="">an election in 2023</a>.</p><p>Mr. Tusk is seeking to slow a Trump-empowered tide of right-wing populism in Europe, and also restore judicial independence, media pluralism, women’s rights and civil debate that liberals say was severely undermined under Law and Justice.</p><p>The eventual winner of the presidential election will replace Andrzej Duda, a conservative and an ally of Law and Justice, who has used his powers to undermine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/world/europe/poland-law-justice-us-trump.html" title="">Mr. Tusk’s plans</a>.</p><p>He has repeatedly vetoed legislation passed by Mr. Tusk’s center-right coalition in Parliament or sent it for judicial review by courts stacked with the previous government’s appointees. Mr. Tusk’s coalition does not have enough votes to override his vetoes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Trzaskowski sought to convince voters that he spoke not only for urban elites and beneficiaries of Poland’s booming economy, but also for people in the conservative rural parts of the country. Many of those people have long been reliable voters for Law and Justice.</p><p>At a recent rally in rural borderlands near Ukraine, Mr. Trzaskowski said he was speaking to “all Poles who want to see our country strong and united.”</p><p>Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
