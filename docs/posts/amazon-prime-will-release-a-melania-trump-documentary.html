Mrs. Trump will be an executive producer of the documentary, which started filming in December, the month after her husband, Donald J. Trump, won the presidential election.</p><p>Amazon said it was “excited to share this truly unique story.”</p><p>The company and its founder, Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, had a rocky relationship with Mr. Trump during Mr. Trump’s first presidential term. But in recent months, Amazon and Mr. Bezos have taken steps to repair it. The tech giant said last month that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/amazon-trump-inauguration.html" title="">donate $1 million to the president-elect’s inaugural fund</a>, joining <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/technology/trump-tech-amazon-meta-openai.html" title="">Meta and executives of some other Silicon Valley companies</a> in writing checks to the inaugural committee. Mr. Bezos has said he is “very optimistic” about Mr. Trump’s new term in office and is eager to work with his administration on reducing regulation.</p><p>During his first presidential term, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Bezos because of his newspaper’s political coverage and questioned whether the U.S. Postal Service was charging Amazon too little for shipping. Amazon, in turn, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/technology/amazon-depose-trump-pentagon-jedi.html" title="">accused Mr. Trump of using “improper pressure” on the Pentagon</a> to deny the company a cloud-computing contract.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Amazon now appears to be eager to turn the page.</p><p>In October, The Post <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/business/media/washington-post-presidential-endorsement.html" title="">said it would stop endorsing presidential candidates</a>, a decision made by Mr. Bezos, and did not publish an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris that had already been drafted. Mr. Bezos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/media/washington-post-endorsement-editorial-board.html" title="">defended his decision</a>, saying newspaper endorsements “create a perception of bias.”</p><p>Last week, Ann Telnaes, a Post cartoonist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/business/media/washington-post-cartoonist-quits-after-jeff-bezos-cartoon-is-killed.html" title="">said she was resigning</a> after the paper’s opinion section rejected a cartoon that showed Mr. Bezos and three other technology executives bending the knee to a statue of Mr. Trump while offering the president-elect bags of money. David Shipley, The Post’s opinion editor, said that the cartoon was rejected because the section had published a column on the same subject and had already scheduled another one for publication. He said he had asked Ms. Telnaes to rescind her resignation, saying, “the only bias was against repetition.”</p><p>Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the efforts by the company and Mr. Bezos to forge closer ties to Mr. Trump. The Trump transition team also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mrs. Trump has recently shown more willingness to share details about her life with the public. Last year, she published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/melania-trump-book-abortion-2020-election.html" title="">a memoir</a> that described her career as a model, marriage to Mr. Trump and time in the White House. It became a No. 1 New York Times best seller. Her role as executive producer of the documentary suggests that she will have some influence over how it depicts her life.</p><p>Brett Ratner, a director and producer behind movies like “Rush Hour” and “The Revenant,” will direct the documentary. Mr. Ratner has kept a lower profile in recent years after questions were raised about his behavior. In 2011, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/business/media/movie-figure-brett-ratner-resigns-as-oscar-co-producer.html" title="">resigned as co-producer of the Oscars</a> broadcast after he used an anti-gay slur at a public event. In 2017, Mr. Ratner was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/business/brett-ratner-sexual-harassment.html" title="">accused of sexual misconduct</a> by six women in an article published by the Los Angeles Times, claims that he denied.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Amazon, which will have exclusive rights to the movie about Mrs. Trump, said that it will reveal more details on the project as filming progresses and it finalizes release plans.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nico Grant reports on Alphabet’s Google and YouTube as well as the corporate culture of Silicon Valley. He is based in San Francisco.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nico-grant">More about Nico Grant</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
