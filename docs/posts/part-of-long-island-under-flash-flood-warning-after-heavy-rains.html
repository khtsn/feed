The National Weather declared a rare flash flood emergency, describing it as a “particularly dangerous situation.”</p><p>The same storm system dumped nearly 10 inches of rain in some areas of Connecticut on Sunday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/nyregion/connecticut-flooding-southbury.html" title="">causing rivers to crest their banks</a> and leading to another flash flood emergency declaration and about 100 evacuations, officials said. And in New York City, the downpour disrupted trains and forced the authorities to ground or cancel flights.</p><p>On Monday, more than 900,000 people in Suffolk County on Long Island were under a flash flood emergency that expired before dawn, <a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1825403430300778707" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the National Weather Service</a>. A flash flood emergency represents the highest level of flood risk, above an alert and a warning. </p><p>A flash flood warning remained in place until 6:30 a.m. for eastern Suffolk County. The agency <a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1825383831647797580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> early Monday that several inches of rain had fallen, and that multiple rescues were ongoing in the Nesconset, Ronkonkoma, Smithtown and St. James areas on Long Island.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Suffolk County Police Department received dozens of calls overnight, including from drivers stranded in floodwaters and residents whose basements and first floors had been inundated, a police spokesman said. He added that the police had not received any reports of injuries.</p><p>The flooding also forced the closure of parts of some major highways and the suspension of some train service. That threatened to disrupt the morning commute.</p><p>A portion of the Long Island Expressway, the major roadway connecting Long Island to New York City, was briefly closed for a two-mile stretch in both directions near the town of Dix Hills early Monday, according to New York State authorities. New York State Route 25 was also closed in both directions near Dix Hills.</p><p>North of the city, the Bronx River Parkway was briefly closed for a two-mile stretch in both directions between the town of Scarsdale and the city of White Plains. Parts of the Harlem River Drive in Manhattan and the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx were blocked by flooding on Sunday, the police <a href="https://x.com/NYPDnews/status/1825358596349342135" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>In Connecticut, <a href="https://new.mta.info/agency/metro-north-railroad" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Metro-North trains</a> on the Danbury and Waterbury branches of the New Haven line were suspended through Monday morning after flooding and a mudslide in the area, the M.T.A. said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Flash flood emergencies or flash flood warnings were declared in Connecticut on Sunday for parts of Fairfield, New Haven, Litchfield and Hartford counties. In some places, the flooding was so severe that the police were unable to respond to calls because their cars were underwater and the roads were damaged.</p><p>At least 100 people were evacuated, Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/governor/news/press-releases/2024/08-2024/governor-lamont-statement-on-severe-flooding-impacting-portions-of-connecticut?language=en_US" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>. </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
