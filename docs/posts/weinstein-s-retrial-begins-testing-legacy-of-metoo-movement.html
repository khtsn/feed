His offered them scripts and the promise of fame, and “used those dream opportunities as weapons,” Shannon Lucey, an assistant district attorney, said.</p><p>Mr. Weinstein “wanted their bodies,” Ms. Lucey said of the women — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-mimi-haleyi.html" title="">Miriam Haley</a>, a former television production assistant; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-jessica-mann.html" title="">Jessica Mann</a>, an aspiring actress; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-model.html" title="">Kaja Sokola,</a> a model. Ms. Sokola has accused Mr. Weinstein of forcing her to masturbate him and blocking the door when she tried to escape; she was 16 at the time.</p><p>“The more they resisted, the more forceful he got,” Ms. Lucey said.</p><p>The trial against Mr. Weinstein is the second time Manhattan prosecutors have put him before a jury. His first trial in 2020 ended in a split verdict — he was convicted of rape and criminal sexual act, while the jury acquitted him on three other charges, including accusations that he was a sexual predator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But last April, the state’s highest court overturned that conviction in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/25/nyregion/weinstein-appeal-ruling-overturned-ny.html" title="">fiercely contested 4-3 decision</a>, in which the majority said Mr. Weinstein had been deprived of a fair trial when prosecutors were allowed to call witnesses who said he had assaulted them, but whose accusations were not backed by physical evidence and were not the basis for any of the charges against him.</p><p>Mr. Weinstein, who had been serving a 23-year sentence on those charges, has also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/us/harvey-weinstein-sentence-los-angeles.html" title="">convicted of sex crimes in California</a> and faces prison there.</p><p>On Wednesday, the 12 jurors and six alternates appeared to listen closely as Ms. Lucey told them about the three women, their upbringings and the allegations of sexual assault against Mr. Weinstein.</p><p>One man sat turned toward Ms. Lucey, his eyes unwaveringly focused and his chin resting on his closed fist. A female juror’s eyebrows rose and she quickly looked down as Ms. Lucey described an episode in which Ms. Mann said the defendant dragged her into a room in 2013 and forced her into oral sex.</p><p>Mr. Weinstein sat in a wheelchair at the defense table, turned toward Ms. Lucey with his left hand over the back of the chair. Throughout the prosecutor’s opening statement, Mr. Weinstein, dressed in a dark suit and white shirt, appeared attentive, at times sitting with his elbows on the table and his hands clasped in front of his face. His lawyers were to deliver their opening later Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Lucey gave her opening statement under the eyes of Alvin L. Bragg, the district attorney; Meg Reiss, the chief assistant district attorney; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/nyregion/trump-prosecution-hush-money-trial.html" title="">Susan Hoffinger</a>, chief of the office’s investigations division. Across the aisle sat three rows of lawyers and others connected to Mr. Weinstein and his defense.</p><p>In the back of the courtroom on Wednesday sat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial-tarale-wulff.html" title="">Tarale Wulff</a> and Dawn Dunning, both of whom testified against Mr. Weinstein in his first New York trial and whose testimony was ruled inadmissible by the state’s highest court.</p><p>The core of the defense is likely to be that Mr. Weinstein’s relationships with the women were consensual. In the first trial, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers said that his accusers had maintained sexual relationships with him long after the assaults were said to have occurred.</p><p>In 2020, the defense lawyers used emails and writings in an effort to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-trial.html" title="">discredit the women</a>, showing them asking for movie premiere tickets and thanking Mr. Weinstein for his support, among other things.</p><p>The defense team will also have transcripts of testimony from the first trial and will be able to compare what the women say now with what they said five years ago.</p><p>In a September filing, prosecutors said they planned to call “corroborating witnesses” as well as experts who will testify about why victims of rape and sexual assault sometimes maintain contact with their assailants and might not tell law enforcement.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering criminal justice in New York, with a focus on the Manhattan district attorney&#39;s office and state courts.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
