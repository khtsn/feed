But after the authorities crushed protests that rocked the city in 2019, China imposed a national security law, and tolerance for dissent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/world/asia/hong-kong-press-freedom.html" title="">in the city’s freewheeling media</a> began to evaporate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The two editors have maintained their innocence. Mr. Chung said in his court testimony that they were operating within journalistic principles, to deliver stories with news value and of public interest.</p><p>“We didn’t have a hidden agenda, or any other goals that you couldn’t see,” he said in his testimony during the trial last year. “When we saw very important events with a lot of public interest; we only wanted to document them.”</p><p>The case has highlighted how press freedom is shrinking in Hong Kong, casting a pall over a media environment where local news providers already try to avoid crossing government red lines on coverage, and where foreign media faces increasing scrutiny from the authorities.</p><p>Guilty verdicts “could impose an additional chilling effect on the local media industry that has been exercising self-censorship heavily since 2020,” said Eric Lai, a research fellow at Georgetown Center for Asian Law and an expert in Hong Kong law.</p><p>Hong Kong’s press freedom ranking fell to 135th out of 180 countries and territories, according to an index compiled by the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders. A representative of the organization <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/world/asia/hong-kong-rsf-detain-expel.html" title="">was denied entry</a> to Hong Kong on a fact-finding mission in April.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The trial is the latest example of a clampdown on dissent in Hong Kong that has seen scores of activists, opposition politicians and ordinary citizens who posted comments online sent to jail. The campaign has led to an exodus of local and expatriate residents and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/business/hong-kong-china-politics.html" title="">driven out some foreign companies</a> as the city’s economy struggles to bounce back from the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/world/asia/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-trial.html" title="">The media mogul Jimmy Lai</a>, founder of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, is on trial on charges of conspiracy and collusion with foreign forces under the national security law. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/world/asia/apple-daily-hong-kong.html" title="">newspaper was forced to close in 2021</a> when national security police made it the first media target of their crackdown.</p><p>The trial of the Stand News editors has been plagued by legal delays since their arrest in late 2021. Originally slated to last 20 days, it stretched to more than 50. The verdict was supposed to be handed down last October, but it was pushed back three times.</p><p>The journalists were charged under a British colonial-era sedition law that carries a maximum sentence of up to two years in prison. Hong Kong introduced its own national security law this year that increased the maximum sentence for sedition to seven years — and 10, if an “external force” was involved.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany May is a reporter based in Hong Kong, covering the politics, business and culture of the city and the broader region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tiffany-may">More about Tiffany May</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Media Industry</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Paramount:</strong> Edgar Bronfman Jr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/business/bronfman-drops-paramount-pursuit.html">dropped his 11th-hour pursuit</a> of the owner of CBS and MTV, a decision that all but ensures that Paramount will be acquired by Skydance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Apple:</strong> After a middling run at the box office, the company is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/business/media/apple-movies-theaters-wolfs.html">rethinking its movie strategy</a>, including curtailing the theatrical release of “Wolfs,” a new film starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google</strong><strong>:</strong> The company joined a news industry trade group and key California lawmakers to announce <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/google-california-news-funding.html">a first-in-the-nation agreement aimed at shoring up newsrooms in California</a> with as much as $250 million.</p></li><li><p><strong>ABC News:</strong> Almin Karamehmedovic, the senior executive producer of “World News Tonight with David Muir,” has been named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/business/media/abc-news-president-karamehmedovic.html">the network’s next president</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Minnesota Star Tribune</strong><strong>:</strong> Defying a crisis in local news, the newspaper in Minneapolis is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/business/media/star-tribune-minnesota.html">expanding its coverage</a> beyond the Twin Cities into other parts of the state.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
