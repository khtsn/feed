The launch of a possible tariff war by the United States, the biggest trading partner and closest ally of the European Union and Britain, would hammer major industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals and machinery.</p><p>And the need to raise military spending because of doubts about America’s guarantees in Europe would further strain national budgets and increase deficits.</p><p>In addition, the president-elect’s more confrontational attitude toward <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/business/trump-china-trade-war.html" title="">China</a> could pressure Europe to pick sides or face retribution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Europe’s worst economic nightmare has come true,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the Dutch bank ING.

Competition from Chinese electric cars has already bitten into the sector’s sales overseas and in Europe.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Leaders are torn between placating China or confronting it. The German government last month voted against the European Union’s plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/european-union-china-electric-vehicle-tariffs.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">impose tariffs</a> as high as 45 percent on electric vehicles made in China. Other countries like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/spain-china-investment.html" title="">Spain</a> abstained. A majority approved, and in response, China slapped new duties on European <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/business/china-europe-brandy.html" title="">brandy</a>, most of which comes from France.</p><p>Tit-for-tat tariffs between the United States and the European Union would further dim the outlook for the auto industry. The United States is the largest market for cars exported from Germany, accounting for nearly 13 percent of the 3.1 million autos that it sold abroad in 2023.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s talk during the campaign of making the European Union “pay a big price” for not buying enough American imports and imposing across-the-board tariffs of 10 or 20 percent may be a starting point for negotiations. Yet even analysts who expect him to take more modest steps say <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/07/economy/goldman-sachs-european-growth-trump-presidency/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">targeted duties</a> on the auto industry are likely.</p><p>“Many in Europe have not yet fully understood what it means to think about geopolitics and economic policy together,” said Hildegard Müller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Higher American tariffs, of course, reach far beyond Germany and the automotive industry to include Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company behind <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/business/ozempic-denmark-novo-nordisk.html" title="">Ozempic</a>, as well as sectors like food, wine, cheese, pearls, chemicals, nuclear reactors, glassware, shoes and more in more than two dozen countries.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Competition from Chinese electric cars, including from the manufacturer BYD, has hurt European automakers’ sales abroad and in Europe.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Felix Schmitt for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Luisa Santos, the deputy director of BusinessEurope, a lobby group representing thousands of companies, warned that tariffs would raise costs and hamper investment.</p><p>“We’re still hoping that because of the importance of the economic relationship, they will be reconsidered and we won’t have them,” she said of tariffs. Direct investment from the European Union in the United States totaled <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/european-union#:~:text=European%20Union%20FDI%20in%20the,and%20insurance%2C%20and%20wholesale%20trade." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2.4 trillion in 2022</a>, which in turn created more than <a href="https://trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-footprint-us/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3.4 million American jobs,</a> according to the European Union.</p><p>Currently, the average U.S. tariff for European imports is around 3 to 4 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, higher U.S. duties on China, another of Mr. Trump’s trade promises, would likely encourage Chinese manufacturers to expand sales outside the United States, heightening competition with rival European producers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>European companies may look to set up or expand production in the United States. Yet any manufacturer that uses materials imported from China would find costs rising no matter where its facilities were.</p><p>Vestas, a Danish company and the world’s leading wind turbine maker, said it was already increasing production at its two American plants in Colorado. More than 40 percent of its orders originated in the Americas in the three months that ended in September.</p><p>“The world has become different in terms of tariffs,” Henrik Andersen, the company’s chief executive, said on a call with industry analysts last week. Vestas has already had to navigate tariffs that were imposed during the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, he said: “Which is why you try to exclude more and more volumes and more and more components from China origin when it’s about the U.S.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vestas, the leading Danish wind turbine maker, has announced plans to increase production at its two Colorado plants.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Charlotte de la Fuente for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Tariffs are not the only problem for the wind industry.
