Prosecutors say Mr. Combs enlisted employees, enablers and prostitutes to stage far darker soirees than White Parties called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">“freak-offs”</a> — drug-heavy, sometimes days-long hotel parties during which investigators say he abused and coerced participants into sexual acts, which he sometimes filmed and masturbated to.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">criminal indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court this month</a> has invited something of a reappraisal of the White Parties for some of those who reveled or worked at them. Were they merely innocuous, press-conscious branding events at which to see and be seen? Or was there, beyond the all-white facade, a darker element?</p><p>Indeed, a recent lawsuit claims misdeeds occurred at those events, too: In July, Adria English, who was hired by Mr. Combs to work a series of White Parties in the mid-to-late 2000s, sued him, asserting she was plied with drugs and ecstasy-laced liquor at the events, and commanded to have sex with certain guests, making her into “a sexual pawn.” Jonathan Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, denied in July that his client had ever <strong>“</strong>sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Combs’s parties were known for drawing celebrities and notable people including Al Sharpton and Mary J.

He has pleaded not guilty, and his legal team has cast his prosecution as an example of “unjust prosecution” of consensual behavior.</p><p>“He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal,” said Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, adding, “These are the acts of an innocent man with nothing to hide, and he looks forward to clearing his name in court.”</p><p>Nonetheless, the charges have thrust Mr. Combs’s <a href="https://www.vibe.com/gallery/diddy-parties-inside-the-fallen-moguls-star-studded-soirees-1998-2010-1234924107/jay-z-20/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parties</a> back <a href="https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/diddy-interview-party-locking-doors-early-2000s-resurfaces-1234925772/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">into the spotlight</a>, as hundreds of photos of <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/09/23/celebrity-news/inside-sean-diddy-combs-wild-parties-leonardo-dicaprio-sarah-jessica-parker-j-lo-more-spotted-in-resurfaced-pics/?_gl=1*192yji7*_ga*NDMzOTA5MjM1LjE3MjcxMzAyNTU.*_ga_0DZ7LHF5PZ*MTcyNzEzMDI1NC4xLjEuMTcyNzEzMDI1OS41NS4wLjA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">celebrities rubbing shoulders with the musician</a> have resurfaced, including Hollywood A-listers like Leonardo DiCaprio, the writer Salman Rushdie, and Donald J. Trump, an indication of Mr. Combs’s broad reach into worlds of music, movies, fashion and more.</p><p>Few of the attendees have spoken in recent days about what it was like inside a Combs party, though celebrities of all stripes have over the years recounted what it was like to hang out with him, sometimes declining — with smiles — to provide more details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>No invitation, perhaps, was more coveted than one to a White Party, which Mr. Combs began to stage in the late 1990s. They were lavish, orchestrated events that seemed to be as much about public relations as carousing. Veteran celebrities mixed with of-the-moment stars and the high-society set at gatherings that often had civic-minded causes. The dress code and décor — all white — suggested a certain pristine simplicity.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“There were the beautiful people, but it also was a lot of Hamptons people, and young people, nightclub kids,” said Patrick McMullan, the nightlife photographer, who attended some of the parties. “They all wanted to be part of that scene.”</p><p>In her 114-page suit — which included a “trigger warning” because of its graphic nature — Ms. English, who said she worked at several White Parties in the mid-to-late 2000s, suggested the glamour was a facade. At one party, she said that Mr. Combs asked her to wear a black dress to indicate to other guests that she was available for sexual encounters. She said she was later paid $1,000 for an encounter with a guest, according to the court papers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The scene at a White Party that Mr. Combs hosted at his East Hampton estate in 2007.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Bedder, via Getty Images for CP</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of the pool area at the 2007 party.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mat Szwajkos, via Getty Images for CP</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Ms. English, who had previously worked as an erotic dancer and adult film actress, also accused Mr. Combs in her suit of allowing other unidentified men to sexually assault her — and filming the acts — while she was unconscious at White Parties in New York, and his home in Star Island, Fla.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The true nature of her employment at the White Parties was grotesque, inexcusable, exploitative and criminal,” the suit says.</p><p>In responding to the suit in July, Mr. Combs’s lawyer, Mr. Davis said: “We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.”</p><p>One veteran of the Hamptons social scene said the accusations against Mr. Combs have led some to revisit their own experiences of attending a White Party.</p><p>“Everybody that could go, went,” said R. Couri Hay, a New York City publicist who has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/style/hamptons-dish-hot-and-reheated.html" title="">long written about the society scene in the Hamptons</a>, though he said he now wondered “what was happening behind closed doors.”</p><p>Mr. Hay agreed that the “public-facing” White Parties were meant to boost and promote Mr. Combs’s image. “This was Puffy&#39;s Met Gala, this was Puffy’s Oscars, this was Puffy’s Grammy Awards,” he said.</p><p>White Parties usually ran from daytime to the wee hours. Some guests brought their children — as did Mr. Combs — who gobbled free ice cream alongside stars. Brand-name sponsors plastered their names on white-carpeted backdrops and gave away swag. Invitees sometimes included, alongside high-profile celebrities and friends, some lesser-known models, at times recruited from New York City catwalk shows.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Once guests arrived, sometimes brought from Manhattan by the busload, waiters in white tuxedos circulated with champagne. Pains were taken to make sure the White Parties were well received in the Hamptons, said Nicholas Kraus, whom Mr. Combs hired to conduct diplomacy with his Long Island neighbors, including offering them limo rides and dinners at fancy restaurants on Mr. Combs’s dollar, to stave off noise complaints.</p><p>No expense was spared, no detail overlooked: In 2004, Mr. Combs brought an original copy of the Declaration of Independence to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/06/arts/politics-and-partying-meet-in-the-hamptons.html" title="">a July 4 White Party in Bridgehampton</a>, a borrowed relic — from the television producer Norman Lear — that was accompanied by a team of burly security officers.</p><p>“I promise not to spill champagne on it,” Mr. Combs joked.</p><p>That fete — which was <a href="https://www.sony.com/content/sony/en/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2004/sean-p-diddy-combs-jayz-and-paris-hilton-join-playstation2-to-celebrate-4th-of-july-weekend-in-style.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoted by Sony</a> and also hosted by Jay-Z and Paris Hilton — offered a buffet of upper-crust entertainment options, including badminton, horseback riding and croquet. It doubled as a kickoff event for a get-out-the-vote organization Mr. Combs had founded, Citizen Change, part of an effort he described to “make this election the hottest, most sexiest thing ever.”</p><p>At the 2009 party in Beverly Hills, the settings and stagecraft was equally sumptuous, with scores of white ottomans and a custom-built trellis over the pool, wrapped in white gauze, from which Mr. Kutcher would later swing. The party promoted Malaria No More, a nonprofit that provides mosquito netting and other services in malarial zones. The dress code was strict, and enforced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Combs and his children Justin Combs, Christian Casey Combs and Quincy Combs at the 2007 party.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Bedder, via Getty Images for CP</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ashton Kutcher prepares to swing across a swimming pool at one of Mr. Combs’s White Parties.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jason Merritt/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“White meant white,” said T. Scott Case, the former chief executive officer of Malaria No More. “Don’t be showing up in eggshell.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Some of the White Parties also had a sensual vibe. Models wore angel wings, and occasionally went topless.

Mr. Combs let him in, however, on the condition that he go on to “do good things for people.”</p><p>As the sun set, Mr. Blaze said he grew uncomfortable. Drunk men bellowed at models in the pool, he said, groping or preventing them from getting into dry clothes. No one intervened.</p><p>“The response was: ‘It’s a hip-hop party, it’s a Diddy party, it’s the White Party,’” Mr. Blaze recalled.</p><p>At another White Party, held in 2006 at Nikki Beach, the famed beachside club in St. Tropez, guests encountered erotically charged photos, including two tongues entwined and Mr. Combs’s hand over a woman’s bikini bottom. Another photo showed the star shirtless, with his signature sunglasses and a pair of jewel-encrusted crosses dangling over his glistening chest. A yacht bobbed offshore.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Combs discontinued his White Parties after the Beverly Hills event <a href="https://www.gq.com/gallery/puff-daddy-white-party-fourth-of-july-sean-combs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in 2009</a>; his representatives said that part of the reason was that the mogul was spending less time in the Hamptons. They added that the parties were “iconic, a true convergence of hip-hop, Hollywood and Black excellence,” with “an endless stream of people vying to attend.”</p><p>Now, however, after being denied bail, Mr. Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He could face <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diddy-sean-combs-lawsuit-allegations.html" title="">life in prison</a> if convicted of racketeering conspiracy; the other two charges also carry the potential for lengthy prison terms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jason Merritt/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Sept. 29, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a nightlife photographer.
