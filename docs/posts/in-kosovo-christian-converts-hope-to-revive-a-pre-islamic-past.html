In a census last spring, 93 percent of the population professed itself Muslim and only 1.75 percent Roman Catholic.</p><p>A small number of ethnic Albanian Christian activists, all converts from Islam, are urging their ethnic kin to look to the church as an expression of their identity. They call it the “return movement,” a push to revive a pre-Islamic past they see as an anchor of Kosovo’s place in Europe and a barrier to religious extremism spilling over from the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Until the Ottoman Empire conquered what is today Kosovo and other areas of the Balkans in the 14th century, bringing with it Islam, ethnic Albanians were primarily Catholics. Under Ottoman rule, which lasted until 1912, most of Kosovo’s people switched faiths.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Father Fran Kolaj baptizing a woman wearing a traditional Albanian outfit in Llapushnik.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armend Nimani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By reversing that process, said Father Fran Kolaj, the priest who carried out the baptisms outside the village of Llapushnik, ethnic Albanians can recover their original identity.</p><p>Ethnic Albanians, who trace their roots to an ancient people called the Illyrians, live mainly in Albania, a country on the Adriatic Sea. But they also make up a large majority of the population in neighboring Kosovo and more than a quarter of the population in North Macedonia.</p><p>At the church where the baptisms took place, nationalist emblems jostle with religious iconography. The double-headed eagle symbol of Albania decorates the steeple and also a screen behind the altar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It is time for us to return to the place where we belong — with Christ,” Father Fran Kolaj said in an interview.</p><p>In many Muslim lands, renouncing Islam can bring severe punishment, sometimes even death. So far, the baptism ceremonies taking place in Kosovo have stirred no violent opposition, though there have been some angry denunciations online. (It is not known how many conversions have so far taken place.)</p><p>But historians, who agree that Christianity was present in Kosovo long before the Ottoman Empire brought Islam, question the thinking behind the movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ethnic Albanian supporters of a push to convert Kosovo Muslims to Christianity gathered at a restaurant in November in Reqice, Kosovo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armend Nimani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“From a historical perspective what they say is true,” said Durim Abdullahu, a historian at the University of Pristina. But, he added, “their logic means that we should all become pagans” because the people living on the territory of today’s Kosovo before the arrival of Christianity and later Islam were nonbelievers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Like many other Kosovars, Mr. Abdullahu said he believed that Serbia, which has a mostly Orthodox Christian population, had helped stoke the return movement as a way of sowing discord in Kosovo. While Serbia has long been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/world/europe/serbia-kosovo-troops-vucic.html?searchResultPosition=18" title="">accused of undermining Kosovo’s stability</a>, there is no evidence it has been promoting the conversions.</p><p>Archaeologists in 2022 uncovered the remains of a sixth-century Roman church near Pristina, and in 2023 found a mosaic with an inscription indicating that early Albanians, or at least a people perhaps related to them, were Christians.</p><p>Still, Christophe Goddard, a French archaeologist working at the site, said it was wrong to impose modern concepts of nation and ethnicity on ancient peoples. “This is not history but modern politics,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Christophe Goddard, a French archaeologist working at the site of a sixth-century Roman church near Pristina, Kosovo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armend Nimani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Traces of Kosovo’s distant pre-Islamic past also survived in a small number of families that clung to Roman Catholicism despite the risk of being ostracized by their Muslim neighbors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Marin Sopi, 67, a retired Albanian language teacher who was baptized 16 years ago, said his family had been “closet Catholics” for generations. In childhood, he recalled, he and his family observed Ramadan with Muslim friends but secretly celebrated Christmas at home.</p><p>“We were Muslims during the day and Christians at night,” he said. Since coming out as a Christian, he said, 36 members of his extended family have formally abandoned Islam.</p><p>Islam and Christianity in Kosovo mostly coexisted in peace — until Orthodox Christian soldiers and nationalist paramilitary gangs from Serbia began torching mosques and expelling Muslims from the homes in the 1990s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children who took part in a mass baptism talking with a Catholic nun in Llapushnik after the ceremony in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armend Nimani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Foreign Christian missionaries have kept their distance from Kosovo’s conversion campaign. But some ethnic Albanians living in Western Europe have offered support, seeing a return to Catholicism as Kosovo’s best hope of one day entering the European Union, a largely Christian club.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Arber Gashi, an ethnic Albanian living in Switzerland, traveled to Kosovo to attend the baptism ceremony at the church in Llapushnik, which overlooks the scene of a major battle in 1998 between Serb forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army.</p><p>He and other activists worry that funding for mosque-building and other activities from Turkey and countries in the Middle East like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with their more conservative approaches, threatens Kosovo’s traditionally laid-back form of Islam. Most of this money has gone into economic development projects unrelated to religion.</p><p>The center of Pristina has a statue honoring Mother Teresa, the Catholic nun and Nobel Peace Prize laureate of Albanian descent, and is dominated by a large Roman Catholic cathedral built after the war with Serbia. But Turkey is currently funding the construction nearby of a giant new mosque that will be even bigger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mural honoring Mother Teresa, the Catholic nun and Nobel Peace Prize laureate of Albanian descent, in Llapushnik.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armend Nimani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Mr. Gashi also said that he feared a return of the Islamic extremism that emerged in Kosovo’s first, chaotic decade of independence. <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/kosovo-home-many-isis-recruits-struggling-stamp-out-its-homegrown-terrorism-problem" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">By some counts,</a> Kosovo provided more recruits to the Islamic State in Syria than any other European country.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Christianity, on the other hand, would open a path to Europe, he said.</p><p>A crackdown by the authorities in recent years has silenced extremism and reinforced Kosovo’s traditionally relaxed take on Islam. The streets of Pristina are lined with bars serving a wide range of alcohol. Veiled women are extremely rare.</p><p>Gezim Gjin Hajrullahu, 57, a teacher who was among those baptized recently in Llapushnik, said he had joined the Catholic church “not for the sake of religion itself” but for the “sake of our national identity” as ethnic Albanians. His wife also converted.</p><p>Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian prime minister, Albin Kurti, in an interview in Pristina, played down the importance of religion to Albanian identity. “For us, religions came and went but we are still here,” he said. “For Albanians, in terms of identity, religion was never of first importance.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian prime minister, Albin Kurti, has played down the importance of religion to Albanian identity.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>That sets them apart from other peoples in the now vanished, multiethnic federal state of Yugoslavia, which disintegrated during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s.

He was sent to jail off the coast of Croatia as a political prisoner. Many of his fellow inmates were Catholics, he recalled, and helped stir what he now sees as his true faith and a belief that “our ancestors were all Catholics.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Boik Breca at an inauguration ceremony for a new church in the village of Pollate.

The gathering, attended by nationalist intellectuals and former Kosovo Liberation Army fighters, discussed ways to promote “Albanian-ness” and decided that Christianity would help.</p><p>“We are no longer Muslims as of today,” attendees <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1079660770367904&amp;id=61557071351973&amp;substory_index=1079660770367904" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, adopting the slogan: “To be only Albanians.”</p><p>The meeting led to the formation of what was initially called the Movement for the Abandonment of the Islamic Faith, a provocative name since largely dropped in favor of the “Movement of Return.”</p><p>From his office in Pristina, decorated with a model of Mecca, Kosovo’s grand mufti, Naim Ternava, has watched the return movement with anxiety and dismay. The push for Muslims to switch to Christianity, he said, risked disrupting religious harmony and was being used by “foreign agents to spread hatred of Islam.”</p><p>“Our mission,” he added, “is to keep people in our religion.
