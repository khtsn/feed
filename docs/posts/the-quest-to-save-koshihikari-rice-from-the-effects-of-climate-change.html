Compared with other types of rice, Koshihikari has a particularly low tolerance for heat, and the scorching temperatures turned its grains cloudy and brittle.</p><p>That was a crushing blow to farmers in Niigata, where Koshihikari rice is the economy’s biggest agricultural output.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Shingo Kuwabara, wearing a lavender T-shirt, black pants and yellow rain boots, holds a clear umbrella in the middle of a field of rice with mountains in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb/JAPAN-RICE-02-gjmb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7bcbd3f2-5a36-5c05-9269-d208ef7b13ee" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shingo Kuwabara at a Shinnosuke rice field on his farm. “Shinnosuke rice is not damaged by rain and heat compared to Koshihikari rice,” he said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Uonuma region of southern Niigata, where some of Japan’s best Koshihikari is produced.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Last year, less than 5 percent of the prefecture’s rice was given the top quality grade that allows it to be sold for a higher price — about $6 or $7 more for each 130-pound bag. Over the past decade, typically about 80 percent or more of Koshihikari rice from Niigata has been ranked top-tier.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Koshihikari is one small part of a global agriculture industry that is being upended by rising temperatures. From grape growers in Bordeaux to cocoa harvesters in Africa, farmers have been forced to alter practices that have been in place for generations.</p><p>Heat is also affecting rice production in other Asian growing hubs like Vietnam and Thailand. “The story is ultimately much bigger than Japan,” said Charles Hart, a senior commodities analyst at BMI, a unit of the research firm Fitch Solutions.</p><p>“Rice is very water-intensive, and in a context of gradually increasing temperatures and more frequent periods of intense heat, heat-resistant rice needs to be the direction of travel,” Mr. Hart said.</p><p>In Japan, where the government uses tariffs to limit rice imports, last year’s poor harvest of Koshihikari contributed to widespread shortages of rice this year. Empty supermarket shelves set off panic and led to calls on Japanese officials to release the country’s strategic rice reserves.</p><p>“For us, last summer was an extreme shock,” said Kazuyuki Kobayashi, a technical specialist at the Niigata Agricultural Research Institute, which was established in 1895. It has left scientists at the research center racing to develop new Koshihikari capable of withstanding such spells of extreme heat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“We had been developing rice based on projections of how high temperatures would get around the end of the 21st century,” Mr. Kobayashi said. In Niigata last summer, “those temperatures had already arrived,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/business/JAPAN-RICE-VIDEO-01-image/JAPAN-RICE-VIDEO-01-image-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/business/JAPAN-RICE-VIDEO-01-image/JAPAN-RICE-VIDEO-01-image-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/10/127705_1_JAPAN-RICE-VIDEO-01_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Shinnosuke rice at the Niigata Agricultural Research Institute in Nagaoka.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An employee drying Shinnosuke rice at the Niigata research center.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On an overcast day in September, Shingo Kuwabara, 38, was midway through harvesting Koshihikari when a downpour forced him to take a break indoors. Mr. Kuwabara watches over nearly 100 acres that have been in his family for more than 300 years.</p><p>Mr. Kuwabara’s farm is in the Uonuma region of southern Niigata — an area known for producing some of Japan’s best Koshihikari. Mineral-rich snowmelt from the surrounding mountains keeps the rice paddies moist. Frequent breezes and evening showers keep temperatures cool.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Last summer, Mr. Kuwabara’s farm and surrounding areas were slammed with temperatures in the high 80s — around 10 degrees hotter than the ideal rice-growing temperature.

Then last year, “we saw many of our Koshihikari grains turn white,” he said.</p><p>Around a decade ago, Mr. Kuwabara began growing a small amount of Shinnosuke — a rice bred by the Niigata Agricultural Research Institute that is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures. During last year’s heat wave, Mr. Kuwabara’s Shinnosuke crops stayed healthy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Shinnosuke accounts for only 5 percent of Mr. Kuwabara’s rice. But if temperatures keep rising as they have, by the time he passes the farm on to the next generation, it may need to account for about half of the farm’s output, he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kuwabara scooping up Koshihikari rice at his farm. “It’s a gamble, whether to increase Shinnosuke or not,” he said.

It tends to become infected with fungus, and rice retailers in Niigata say consumers still prefer the taste of the smaller-grain Koshihikari.</p><p>Many farmers in Niigata say they are reluctant to move away from Koshihikari. It has long been the pride of Niigata, providing families with stable income for generations.</p><p>The incentive to change is especially low for a majority of Japanese farmers who are retirement age or older and have no heir lined up to take over their land.</p><p>“It’s a gamble, whether to increase Shinnosuke or not,” Mr. Kuwabara said.

Those hybrid rices will then be crossbred again with Koshihikari. And that process will be repeated until they get rice that is like Koshihikari in all ways, but can also withstand heat.</p><p>Any new variety “must be as delicious as Koshihikari has always been,” said Mr. Kobayashi, the technical specialist. “Otherwise, farmers will not want to grow it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the Niigata Agricultural Research Institute, scientists have found a DNA pattern that, if introduced to Koshihikari, could give the rice the ability to withstand extreme heat.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noriko Hayashi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Grains from heat-resistant candidates that show promise will be put through the research center’s quality-testing room, where machines will check their stickiness, moisture, roundness and shine.
