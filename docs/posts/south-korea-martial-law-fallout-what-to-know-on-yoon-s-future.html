That makes him the first sitting president to face a criminal investigation, and sets him up to potentially be the first arrested while in office.</p><p>On Tuesday, the National Assembly moved to appoint a special counsel to investigate allegations of insurrection against Mr. Yoon, in addition to the inquiries by the police and prosecutors.</p><p>Here is where things stand for Mr. Yoon.</p><h2 id="link-46e4fbcb">What are the accusations against the president?</h2><p>The investigations into the president center on the deployment of armed troops to the National Assembly shortly after he declared martial law last Tuesday night. The opposition has said that Mr. Yoon ​committed insurrection when he sent the troops to block lawmakers from voting against military rule, as was their right under the country’s Constitution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Col. Kim Hyun-tae, who led a special forces unit that was sent into the Assembly, said he received orders to forcibly remove lawmakers ​to prevent 150 of them — the number required to repeal martial law — from gathering.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Col.

Mr. Yoon ​criticized the opposition for slashing some of his government budgets planned for next year​, as well as its frequent attempts to impeach his political appointees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But such complaints cannot be grounds for declaring martial law, said Kim Young Hoon, head of the Korean Bar Association. Mr. Yoon also did not immediately notify the National Assembly of his declaration of martial law, as required by law, according to the Assembly.</p><p>“It’s clear that President Yoon’s declaration of martial law failed to meet the requirements set by the Constitution,” Mr. Kim said​.</p><p>Cho Ji-ho, head of the National Police Agency, ​told the Assembly on Monday that when martial law was briefly in place, the military asked the police to help it locate and detain 15 people, including the leaders of the biggest political parties​.</p><p>Even during martial law, however, the president has no right to detain lawmakers unless they are caught in committing a crime.</p><h2 id="link-2440b036">What happens if Yoon is arrested?</h2><p>The opposition has tried to impeach Mr. Yoon, an attempt that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeach.html" title="">ended in failure on Saturday</a>. It has said it would call another impeachment vote this Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This is not the first time a South Korean president has faced the threat of impeachment. But it is the first time that a sitting president could be arrested. (For instance, in the case of Park Geun-hye, a former president, she was arrested and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/world/asia/park-geun-hye-sentenced-south-korea.html" title="">convicted of ​corruption</a> and abuse of power after she was removed from office in 2017.)</p><p>It remained unclear when South Korean investigators would question Mr. Yoon or whether they would attempt to arrest him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Yoon Suk Yeol, as he declared martial law last Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">South Korean Presidential Office, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The ban on overseas travel “is usually considered a precursor to arrest,” said Kim Jongcheol, a professor of law at Yonsei University in Seoul.</p><p>The broader political turmoil has already raised questions about who is in charge of the country. The possibility of Mr. Yoon’s arrest only deepens that uncertainty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The country’s Constitution does not specify what should happen if a president is arrested. It says that when the president is “unable to perform his or her duties for any reason,” the prime minister ​will step in as an interim leader.</p><p>But legal scholars are divided over whether being arrested would incapacitate the president. Some scholars say that Mr. Yoon should continue to serve as president, even from prison, unless his legal trouble leads him to step down or prompts the National Assembly to impeach him.</p><p>In South Korea, the prime minister is appointed by the president and serves a largely ceremonial role. When Prime Minister Han Duck-soo presided over a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he said the government was doing its best to “stabilize state affairs” but offered few details.</p><h2 id="link-43deb3d5">How is Yoon’s party handling the crisis?</h2><p>In his last public statement, Mr. Yoon said ​on Saturday that he would leave it to his People Power Party, P.P.P., to decide how long he should stay in office and how the government should be run.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The P.P.P. chairman, Han Dong-hoon, said Mr. Yoon’s statement meant that the president was “excluded​” from all state affairs, including diplomacy, and that the prime minister would run the government with the P.P.P.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Han Dong-hoon, the head of Mr. Yoon’s governing People Power Party, has asserted that the president had been effectively excluded from state affairs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yonhap/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>P.P.P. leaders wanted to give ​Mr. Yoon an “orderly exit​.”​ They had scuttled the opposition-led attempt to impeach Mr. Yoon by boycotting the impeachment vote​ on Saturday.</p><p>The opposition called Mr. Han’s statement ridiculous and unconstitutional, because the president cannot be excluded from the duties of office except through resignation or impeachment.</p><p>“Ordinary citizens would say: ‘Who the hell does he think he is?’” said Lee Jae-myung, the main opposition leader​, referring to Mr. Han, the governing party leader.</p><p>​Indeed, even within Mr. Han’s party, views were divided. The party has been plunged into disarray in the wake of its unpopular decision to boycott the impeachment. It has yet to unveil a road map detailing when and how Mr. Yoon might leave office.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
