It looked big enough to cause potential disruptions. The barrage could also result in Northern and Southern Lights being visible on Thursday evening, reaching much closer to the Equator than usual.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This was the second such watch, which is the space weather equivalent of a hurricane watch, to be issued by the center in the past 19 years.</p><p>The first, in May, put the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/science/solar-storm-earth.html" title="">on alert for a severe solar storm</a> that appeared to be on its way to Earth.

At that point, the watch might be upgraded to a warning.</p><p>In May, the center started talking with power grid operators about six hours before the storm arrived.</p><p>This time, they reached out even earlier, because the power grid, already damaged by Hurricane Helene last month, will be further thrashed as Hurricane Milton bears down on Florida.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“With all the hurricane relief efforts going on and the inbound hurricane going into Florida and across the peninsula, we thought it prudent to immediately contact them now,” Mr. Dahl said. “We don’t know the true status there, but that’s just our concern.”</p><p>Neither the May eruption nor this week’s is as severe as one known as the Carrington Event that hit Earth in 1859, disrupting telegraph stations, or another in 1989 that caused a nine-hour blackout in Quebec.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Discover More in Health and Science</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Finding the ‘Ghost Ship of the Pacific’:</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/science/shipwreck-ghost-ship-pacific-drones.html">rediscovery of the vessel</a>, which was captured by the Japanese for a time during World War II, highlights the potential of underwater autonomous vehicles to map the ocean floor.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Well-Aged Cheese:</strong> Chunks of cheese from 3,600 years ago were dug up with mummified human remains in China, offering insights into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/science/oldest-cheese-kefir-xinjiang.html">the origins of the dairy product known as kefir</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demolishing Chile’s Geoglyphs:</strong> Activists say governments at all levels of the country have failed to prevent desert racers from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/science/geoglyphs-atacama-desert-rallies.html">driving through giant 3,000-year-old figures</a> of animals, humans and objects.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Hot Zone Summer?:</strong> From Covid to dengue, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/health/virus-outbreaks-summer.html">viral outbreaks seemed to be popping up all over</a>.
