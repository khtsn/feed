Inflation, the national debt, the cost of living and unemployment have all recently risen. Environmental damage caused by illegal mining has triggered widespread youth protests.</p><p>The choice for the job of rebuilding the ravaged economy is between candidates from the two political parties that, since multiparty politics resumed in 1992, have each ruled Ghana for 16 years: the ruling New Patriotic Party (N.P.P.) and the main opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (N.D.C.).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A 66-year-old former president, John Dramani Mahama of the N.D.C., is hoping to make a comeback eight years after he was voted out. His main rival, Mahamudu Bawumia, 61, is keen to test out his own ideas after eight years in President Akufo-Addo’s shadow.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mahamudu Bawumia at his final rally in Accra on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nipah Dennis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Analysts see little ideological difference between the two parties or the candidates. Both are from the historically marginalized and predominantly Muslim north, a first in Christian-majority Ghana. Mr. Mahama is Christian, and Mr. Bawumia is Muslim.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-60ea1bab">What are the main issues?</h2><p>Ghana’s economy has been on a roller coaster.</p><p>The government went on a borrowing spree in recent years after running out of cash, only to default on its debt repayments. By 2022, Ghana could no longer borrow from international lenders. Inflation surged, living standards worsened and at least 850,000 more people in a country of 34 million were pushed into poverty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The government has cut expenses and negotiated better terms with its creditors. But people are still suffering. Food insecurity and poverty are projected to keep rising until at least 2026.</p><p>Young people are among the most affected.</p><p>“There is the growing number of graduates who are becoming disenchanted and want to see progress,” said Ishmael Kwabla Hlovor, a political science lecturer at the University of Education, Winneba, in Ghana.</p><p>Weeks before the election, young people turned out to protest the destruction of the environment from illegal mining of minerals. Such mining, known in Ghana as “galamsey,” is widespread, destroying thousands of acres of land and polluting sources of clean drinking water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters chant slogans and carry placards demanding government action on illegal gold mining and the release of activists arrested during earlier protests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nipah Dennis/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>More than 700,000 first-time voters registered this year, most of whom are Gen-Zs. Analysts and youth activists said this is a sign that anger over the government’s failure to address environmental concerns and over its crackdown on the protests will drive youth to vote.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Young people, especially first-time voters, are so eager to vote,” said Hanifatu Hamza, a youth leader. “But there are also those who are fed up with the government and do not want to vote because of the feeling that their votes won’t change anything.”</p><h2 id="link-260b7da0">A relatively secure country in an unstable region</h2><p>Ghana has been an influential geopolitical power in Africa, attracting visits from world leaders seeking to strengthen ties to the continent. Three of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_visits_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the seven U.S. presidents</a> who have made visits to sub-Saharan Africa have chosen to go to Ghana.</p><p>Ghana, the first sub-Saharan country to break free from colonial rule, has proved to be a peaceful, stable democracy in a region where coups and conflict — often from jihadist militants — are common.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Daboya, Ghana, in May, special forces from Tunisia, Libya and Italy train during the annual Pentagon-sponsored counterterrorism exercises known as Flintlock.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Francis Kokoroko for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Though Ghana has been spared direct attacks, reports in the news media and from human rights groups suggest that the country is being used as a refuge for militants in the Sahel — to get food, fuel, weapons <a href="https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-november-20/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and medical treatment</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Security and stability is a big issue in this election,” even if the direct threat is currently low, said Muhammad Dan Suleiman, a fellow at the Centre for African Conflict and Development in London.</p><h2 id="link-17709ef8">Who is expected to win?</h2><p>Polls have shown that the former president, Mr. Mahama, is expected to win.</p><p>There are a total of 12 candidates. But the one expected to give Mr. Mahama a run for his money is Mr. Bawumia, who as vice president has the disadvantage of carrying a slice of blame for the country’s economic challenges. And his party was split when a rival candidate, a former energy minister, broke away to mount his own race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The former president of Ghana, John Mahama, addresses supporters at a rally, in Accra on Thursday, in his bid to make a comeback.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zohra Bensemra/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-1d221f53">When will the winner be known?</h2><p>Polls will be open on Saturday, Dec. 7, until 5 p.m. More than 18 million people have registered to vote.</p><p>Presidential elections in Ghana usually have a high voter turnout, and this year’s is projected to surpass that of 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The results should be announced as they come in from polling stations, starting on Election Day.
