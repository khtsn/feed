Trump before he was re-elected as president this week.</p><p>One of the plotters said that he was assigned in September to carry out the plan by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, the prosecutors said in court papers.</p><p>An Iranian operative said he was told to put aside other efforts he was undertaking on behalf of the Revolutionary Guards and “focus on surveilling, and ultimately, assassinating” Mr. Trump, according to a criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court.</p><p>The operative told a Revolutionary Guards Corps official that such a plan would cost a “huge” amount of money, the complaint said. In response, the official said, “We have already spent a lot of money,” adding that “money’s not an issue.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The charges announced today expose Iran’s continued brazen attempts to target U.S. citizens, including President-elect Donald Trump, other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the regime in Tehran,” said Christopher Wray, director of the F.B.I.</p><p>Iran “has been conspiring with criminals and hit men to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply won’t be tolerated,” he said.</p><p>The newly unsealed complaint also contains allegations that the authorities had disrupted another plot to assassinate Masih Alinejad, a Brooklyn human-rights activist who has long criticized Iran’s repression of women.</p><p>The man prosecutors said was tasked with the plot to kill Mr. Trump and Ms. Alinejad is Farhad Shakeri, 51. Prosecutors said that he was at large and is believed to reside in Iran. Two other men were arrested in the case and face conspiracy charges: Carlisle Rivera, 49, of Brooklyn, and Jonathan Loadholt, 36, of Staten Island.</p><p>Mr. Rivera and Mr. Loadholt were each presented before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan on Thursday and ordered to be detained pending trial. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story and will be
