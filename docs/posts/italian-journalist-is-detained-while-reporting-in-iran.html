The reason for the arrest of Ms. Sala, one of Italy’s most renowned foreign correspondents, has not yet been made public.</p><p>Ms. Sala, a writer and a podcaster, had published reports from Tehran since Dec. 13, describing how the country had changed over the past tumultuous year as military conflict roiled the region and Iran ushered in new leadership with its president, Masoud Pezeshkian, taking office in July.</p><p>In her coverage, Ms. Sala described how many women were now no longer wearing a hijab in defiance of the country’s leadership, and she interviewed an Iranian stand-up comedian who had been jailed in Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Sala was supposed to board her flight back to Italy on Dec. 20, but did not show up at Tehran’s airport, Italy’s foreign ministry said.</p><p>Claudio Cerasa, the editor of the Italian newspaper Il Foglio, which Ms. Sala writes for, <a href="https://www.ilfoglio.it/esteri/2024/12/27/news/il-giornalismo-non-e-un-crimine-riportiamo-a-casa-cecilia-sala-7277959/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in an editorial</a> that she was in Iran on a regular visa. Il Post, an Italian news website where Ms. Sala’s partner, Daniele Raineri, works as a journalist, reported that Ms. Sala was in solitary confinement in Evin, a detention facility in Tehran where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/15/world/middleeast/iran-evin-prison-fire.html" title="">hundreds of dissidents and political prisoners are held</a>.</p><p>Italy’s foreign ministry was negotiating for Ms. Sala’s release.</p><p>Iran has routinely incarcerated Iranian reporters. Recently it detained journalists who covered the case of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman whose death in police custody ignited fierce anti-government protests in 2022. The country has also jailed foreigners and dual nationals, and human rights groups said many of these detentions were a part of a deliberate policy to extract concessions from foreign countries, including prisoner swaps.</p><p>A day before Ms. Sala was arrested in Iran, the police in Milan, Italy, said they had arrested a 38-year-old Iranian man whom the United States accused of providing drone components to the Iran’s Revolutionary Guards — the country’s primary military force. The man faces extradition to the U.S., the Italian police <a href="https://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/arrestato-a-milano-collaboratore-dei-terroristi-ricercato-negli-usa#:~:text=Il%2038enne%20cittadino%20iraniano%20%C3%A8,legge%20federale%20statunitense%20che%20conferisce" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>The statement did not name the man, but earlier that week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/politics/jordan-drone-attack-soldiers-iran.html" title="">the Justice Department charged two men with illegally supplying</a> parts used in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/29/us/us-soldiers-killed-jordan.html" title="">Iranian-backed militia’s drone attack</a> that killed three U.S. service members at an American military base in Jordan in January.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Italy’s foreign ministry said the country’s ambassador to Iran, Paola Amadei, had visited Ms. Sala on Friday and checked on her conditions. Since she was arrested, Italy’s foreign ministry said, Ms. Sala had the opportunity to make two phone calls to her relatives.</p><p>In her coverage, Ms. Sala reported not only on the anti-government protests known as the “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement, but also on the high levels of inflation plaguing the country. She also focused on how Iran’s “axis of resistance” has been unraveling since the fall of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, an ally of the Islamic Republic.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emma-bubola">More about Emma Bubola</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/islamic-revolutionary-guards-corps-quds-force">Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (Quds Force)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Media Industry</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>ABC News:</strong> The decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/business/media/trump-abc-settlement.html">pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit</a> brought by Donald Trump against ABC News came after Disney decided that fighting the suit could hurt the company’s brand and press protections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ozy Media:</strong> Carlos Watson, a co-founder of the now-defunct digital media company, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/business/media/carlos-watson-ozy-media-sentenced.html">sentenced to almost 10 years in prison</a> for trying to defraud investors and lenders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Voice of America:</strong> President-elect Trump’s choice of Kari Lake to serve as the director of the federally funded broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/voice-of-america-journalists-trump.html">sent a chill through the ranks of the organization</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Los Angeles Times:</strong> Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the newspaper’s owner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/media/la-times-patrick-soon-shiong.html">has waded into the publication’s opinion section</a> in ways that have concerned many staff members.</p></li><li><p><strong>BuzzFeed:</strong> BuzzFeed said it had reached a deal to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/business/buzzfeed-hot-ones-sale.html">sell the company behind the popular interview show “Hot Ones” for $82.5 million</a>, easing a cash crunch that has loomed over the media company for months.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
