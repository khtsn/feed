One time, he fell clear up in the second row after the shot.”</p><p>That style was developed “without rhyme or reason, something that came naturally and worked for me,” Barnett told the Times sportswriter Harvey Araton for his book “When the Garden Was Eden” (2011). “It was in the playground before I even got to high school that I learned how to execute that shot without really knowing what I was doing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Barnett battled Tom Sanders of the Boston Celtics for a rebound at Boston Garden in 1968, the only year he made the All-Star team.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The Syracuse Nationals selected Barnett in the first round of the 1959 N.B.A. draft.

After that he spent three seasons with the Lakers, playing with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/sports/jerry-west-dead.html" title="">Jerry West</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/sports/basketball/elgin-baylor-dead.html" title="">Elgin Baylor</a>.

He starred on his high school basketball team before attending Tennessee A&amp;I.</p><p>From 1957 to 1959, his team won back-to-back-back championships in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, a separate conference smaller than the National Collegiate Athletic Association. It was the first Black college basketball team to win any national championship.</p><p>The recent documentary focused on Barnett’s efforts to win greater recognition for that team, which culminated in their collective induction into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. When the surviving members of the team were invited to the White House last year, Barnett remarked succinctly, “Finally.”</p><p>Barnett did not graduate, but while he was a Laker he received a bachelor’s degree in physical education from Cal Poly. He obtained a master’s degree in public administration from New York University while a Knick and a doctorate in education from Fordham University in 1991. He taught sports management at St. John’s University and established a publishing imprint, Fall Back Baby Productions, for which he wrote poetry and commented on athletes and race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Barnett met Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House in 2024, when he and the five other surviving members of the Tennessee A&amp;I team were invited to the White House.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael A.

Bradley pushed a frail Barnett in a wheelchair onto the court to accept the applause of fans. The Knicks have not won a championship since 1973.</p><p>In his 1971 memoir, Holzman praised Barnett for more than his shooting.</p><p>“He has such great basketball instinct,” Holzman said. “He grasps things faster than anyone.”</p><p>The night before Barnett and Holzman were honored, Barnett recalled a long-ago road trip.</p><p>“Some of the players felt it would improve our eyesight if we went to the burlesque show at the hotel, even though we might miss curfew,’’ he said. “When we mentioned it to Red, he told us not to go because we might see something there that we shouldn’t see. But we went to the burlesque show anyway. And we did see something there that we shouldn’t have seen. We saw Red.’’</p><p>Alex Traub<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
