That question has plagued the filmmaker Shaina Feinberg.</p><p>Before Ms. Feinberg was born, her mother dreamed of a successful career as a performer — then gave up those dreams to raise her daughters. That loss still haunts her mother.</p><p>Now a mother herself, Ms. Feinberg is confronted with the same dilemma: Should she quit working as a filmmaker to be a full-time mom? Or keep doing a “depressingly bad job at both”?</p><p>The universe answers her in the unlikely form of Joan Darling, a 90-year-old director and actress. She’s the first woman to be nominated for an Emmy in directing. And unlike Ms. Feinberg’s mother, she never had children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>During the pandemic, a freelance job fortuitously connected Ms. Feinberg with Ms. Darling. That chance encounter spurred the pair to meet in person.</p><p>From there, Ms. Darling becomes Ms. Feinberg’s unexpected life coach on work and motherhood. They spend days filming — and playing — together, as Ms. Feinberg embarks on a journey to learn how to be a career woman and a mom at the same time.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
