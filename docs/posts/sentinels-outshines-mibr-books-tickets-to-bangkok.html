<p>The four-map series played out on Lotus, Abyss, Pearl, and Split, Lotus and Pearl being Sentinels&#39; picks and Abyss and Split being MIBR&#39;s picks. Sentinels won Lotus 13-7 and Abyss 13-5, MIBR won Pearl 21-19, and Sentinels won Split 13-7.</p>

<p>Sentinels came into this match seeking to bounce back after being outdone by G2 yesterday and bag the remaining Bangkok slot. On the other side, MIBR looked to carry their blistering lower bracket run all the way to the grand final after a record-breaking 82-kill performance from <span data-ref-id="3">

</span> in favor of a more traditional Raze-Fade-Viper. However, it was <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/729/zellsis">
		Zellsis	</a>
</span> on Vyse getting off to a white-hot start on the defense, finding an ace in round 5 and consistently shutting MIBR down the C site. The Vyse player racked up 20 kills in just the first half to secure a 9-3 lead for his side. </p>

<p>The second half started off hectic as Sentinels won the round 14 eco before immediately getting ecoed themselves after a crisp 1v3 from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5957/artzin">
		artzin	</a>
</span>. That round gave MIBR the momentum to pick up a few rounds, a 1v2 clutch from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36245/n4rrate">
		N4RRATE	</a>
</span> sealed Lotus 13-7 in Sentinels&#39; favor.</p>


<p><em>If <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/729/zellsis">
		Zellsis	</a>
</span> was the opener for Sentinels on Lotus, <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/36245/n4rrate">
		N4RRATE	</a>
</span> was the closer.</em></p>

<p>Zellsis ended the map with a 24/12/5 KDA and 209 ADR, but it was N4RRATE putting up huge impact in the second half, earning a 19/9/5 KDA and a 1.64 rating.</p>

<p>The next map was MIBR&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428012/sentinels-vs-mibr-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-lbf/?game=195827&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, a map they had a 3-0 record on over the course of Kickoff. The map began with MIBR losing to an eco once again. This time, the Brazilian squad couldn&#39;t win their own eco in response and spent the rest of the half struggling to find answers to the opposition&#39;s constant site hits, enabling Sentinels to take another 9-3 lead. </p>

<p>MIBR managed to get another pistol, but that was all they got—Sentinels ran away with the rest of Abyss to win 13-5. Every player on Sentinels put up numbers, but it was the supportive members in Zellsis and <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3880/bang">
		bang	</a>
</span> scoring impressive ratings of 1.42 and 1.40 ratings respectively with a combined 31 assists.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3880/bang">
		bang	</a>
</span> locks down B to take his team up to map point.</em></p>

<p>One more map stood between Sentinels and Bangkok as they went to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428012/sentinels-vs-mibr-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-lbf/?game=195828&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>. The map opened in a familiar 9-3 lead for Sentinels after an early Dimensional Drift from <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4004/zekken">
		zekken	</a>
</span> helped his team convert the bonus. However, MIBR wouldn&#39;t give up that easily, rallying with a streak of site hits and postplants to run it back all the way to a 12-10 lead of their own. </p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20240/xenom">
		xenom	</a>
</span>&#39;s clutches were key to MIBR&#39;s comeback.</em></p>

<p>A 3v5 from Sentinels barely forced overtime. While both teams struggled on their defense in regulation, overtime was only defense rounds all the way up to 16-16. Sentinels seemed to find checkmate as they finally won an attack round in round 33, but neither side would back down, and overtime continued on. MIBR eventually pulled Pearl over the line 21-19 to put an end to the longest map in VCT Americas history. </p>

<p>aspas led the server with 37 kills, nine of which were first kills, and 157 ADR, surpassing 2,000 total kills in VCT Americas in the process and becoming the first player to do so in any international league. <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20240/xenom">
		xenom	</a>
</span> put up a similarly impressive performance with a 33/23/22 KDA and 145 ADR. </p>

<p>The final map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/428012/sentinels-vs-mibr-champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff-lbf/?game=195829&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a>. Despite the grueling loss in the previous map, Sentinels showed no signs of fatigue, netting a bonus win off of the Dimensional Drift-Bucky combination that zekken brought out many times on Pearl and rolling up to a fourth 9-3 lead. </p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4004/zekken">
		zekken	</a>
</span> was a force to be reckoned with on Split.</em></p>

<p>MIBR managed to hold on for a few more rounds after winning multiple force buys, but Sentinels steadied themselves and won out Split 13-7. zekken came alive on Yoru with 23 kills to 14 deaths, 310 ACS, and a 1.56 rating, while Zellsis topped the scoreboard for the series as a whole with 85 kills to his name.</p>

<p>The fight isn&#39;t over yet—Sentinels will return tomorrow to battle G2 for Championship Points, Bangkok seeding, and the Kickoff trophy.</p>
