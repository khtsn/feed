</span>. This week, they took a 12-4 lead against Heretics on map one of Corrode, then lost 10 rounds in a row to lose 14-12. The M8s had opportunities to close out the map, but Heretics won out in the clutch more than three times to keep themselves alive.</p>

</span>&#39;s Waylay setup that started it all.</em></p>

<p>Gentle Mates also almost squandered a 10-2 lead on Ascent, but barely clutched it out in overtime. Heretics then proceeded to stomp map three. In the whole series, Gentle Mates only won only nine attack rounds across the three maps, a glaring weakness for the team. They currently sit at a 0-2 record, but could have easily been 2-0 had they closed out these matches.</p>

</span>. The match was a sloppy mess throughout, but it looked like Apeks were about to find their first win of the year. However, up 11-7 on the final map, they couldn&#39;t quite close it out, as Karmine Corp clutched up six rounds in a row to take the win.</p>

<p>The biggest stomp this week came from Team Vitality, who bounced back massively this week after their loss to GIANTX. They tore apart FUT to the tune of a 13-2 and 13-5 flattening of the Turkish team. Their two rookies, <span data-ref-id="25">
