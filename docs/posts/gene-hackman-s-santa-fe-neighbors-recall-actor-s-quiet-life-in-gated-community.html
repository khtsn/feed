He won over critics, befriended celebrities and starred in scores of films watched by millions of moviegoers. But for the past two decades, Gene Hackman found solace at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac where few neighbors ever even saw him.</p><p>Mr. Hackman, 95, and his wife, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/betsy-arakawa-wife-gene-hackman-dead.html" title="">Betsy Arakawa</a>, 65, who were both found dead in their home just outside Santa Fe, N.M., last week, were famous for their privacy after retiring. And the revelation that Mr. Hackman probably died <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/gene-hackman-death-investigation-medications-planner.html" title="">nine days</a> before the couple’s bodies were found illustrates the seclusion of their neighborhood and just how isolated they had become.</p><p>In Santa Fe Summit, the gated community where they lived just east of the city, even some of their nearest neighbors said they had seen no sign of the couple in recent years, except for their trash cans on the side of the road, waiting to be picked up.</p><p>The couple did not attend homeowner’s association meetings or annual picnics, and their expansive four-bedroom home — on a quiet road called Old Sunset Trail — is hidden even from the start of the driveway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The couple did have their share of friends <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-death-new-mexico.html" title="">around town</a>. Mr. Hackman had invested in a restaurant, where his paintings hung on the walls, and Ms. Arakawa had co-founded a store that sells home goods. But some friends said the couple retreated farther from public life during the Covid-19 pandemic, and at home, they basked in their neighborhood’s solitude. Their desire for privacy was respected by their neighbors, who include doctors, lawyers and executives drawn to the community in search of private houses with stunning views a short drive from downtown Santa Fe.</p><p>“They have a gate, and we have a gate, and we just have never even seen each other,” said James Everett, who has lived part time in a house next door for about five years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A painting by Mr. Hackman of his wife hangs in Jinja Bar &amp; Bistro in Santa Fe. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adria Malcolm for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The road up to Mr. Hackman’s home is narrow and snakes past stone walls and houses embedded in the hill. From the top of the neighborhood, there are views of tightly packed trees and neighboring hills on one side and the city on the other, with homes and streets visible through a desert-like haze.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the only signs of life in the neighborhood were a handful of maintenance and construction workers who had parked several trucks on the side of a small road. Sculptures that twisted with the wind sat next to some driveways, and street signs denoted roads with quaint names like Bent Hill and Summit Ridge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Those who bumped into Mr. Hackman or Ms. Arakawa over the years said they were friendly and had an obvious love for their three dogs, sometimes walking them through the neighborhood. (One of their three German shepherds was found dead in the house last week, and two others were found alive on the property.)</p><p>Helen Dufreche, who lived on an adjacent street before moving to Louisiana to be closer to her grandchildren, said she would never forget the first time she met Mr. Hackman, more than a decade ago. Wearing a baseball cap, he pulled up alongside her in a truck and marveled at her dachshunds.</p><p>“What cute puppies!” Ms. Dufreche recalled him saying through the window.</p><p>When one of Ms. Dufreche’s dogs, Payton, was a finalist for The Santa Fe New Mexican’s annual pet calendar, Ms. Arakawa stopped to tell Ms. Dufreche that she and Mr. Hackman had recognized Payton’s picture in the paper. Ms. Dufreche said she went home and told Payton, “Gene Hackman’s been talking about you.”</p><p>She said she sometimes saw Ms. Arakawa driving in or out of the neighborhood with the three German shepherds in the back of her Toyota Land Cruiser.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Ms. Dufreche said she last saw Mr. Hackman around 2017, as he drove by in his truck with a mountain bike attached to the back. She said he looked healthy and fit, “just like he did in ‘<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/12/movies/film-review-crimson-tide-deciding-the-world-s-fate-from-the-ocean-s-bottom.html" title="">Crimson Tide</a>.’”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Bud Hamilton, who lived next door to the couple for about two decades, said he and his wife had dinner with them only once, soon after moving to the neighborhood.</p><p>Knowing that Mr. Hamilton was involved with the Cancer Foundation for New Mexico, Mr. Hackman donated a painting every year for the foundation to auction off, up until this past year.</p><p>Mr. Hackman and Ms. Arakawa may have been particularly private, but that was not unusual in Santa Fe Summit. There are only about 55 houses in the community, and many residents — both full-time and part-time — said in interviews that they knew only a handful of their neighbors.</p><p>The neighborhood was first proposed by the developer Ralph L. Brutsche in the 1980s, working with the architect Stephen Ewing. It was advertised in local newspapers as “offering top-of-the-world views” surrounded by “an abundance of natural growth.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Karl Sommer, a lawyer in Santa Fe who worked with Mr. Brutsche, who died in 2018, said Mr. Brutsche had been intent on preserving the area’s features.</p><p>“Ralph knew how to make sure that a development did not destroy the terrain,” Mr. Sommer said. “He was able to preserve the natural beauty of the place without ripping it to pieces.”</p><p>Claire Lange, a real estate agent who lives in a different part of the neighborhood from the Hackman home, said seclusion was part of the appeal of living in the hills.</p><p>“Santa Fe is about enjoying the beauty, but also about being private and doing your own thing,” she said. “People live here very, very quietly.”</p><p>Others agreed.</p><p>“I know there’s some nice people up there, I just don’t know them,” said Beau Theriot, who lives in Texas and visits his house in the neighborhood a few times a year. He said he was a big fan of Mr. Hackman’s films and had seen him a few years ago, using a cane as he walked along the road beside his wife.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The house where Mr. Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, lived and were found dead.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roberto E.

Her husband saw Mr. Hackman walking a dog at Christmas, she said, but otherwise they had not encountered the couple.</p><p>Harvey Chalker, a longtime resident of the enclave who ran a ski shop in Santa Fe for several decades with his wife, said that when he was president of the homeowner’s association, Ms. Arakawa handled the couple’s business, and Mr. Hackman once bought a pair of hiking shoes from his shop.</p><p>“He wanted to be quiet, he didn’t want to be bothered, and I don’t blame him,” Mr. Chalker said.</p><p>Several neighbors said they were particularly heartbroken that Mr. Hackman had apparently died on Feb. 17, meaning that he and Ms. Arakawa might have been dead for as long as nine days before being discovered last Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Fernando Miranda, a neurologist who has owned a house near the couple since 2018, said he had been thinking back to his most recent visit to the neighborhood, shortly after Feb. 17. He said he had spent time as he usually did, reading, playing the harpsichord and reflecting.</p><p>It was sad, Dr. Miranda said, to think that Mr. Hackman — one of his heroes — was probably lying dead, but not yet discovered, a few houses away.</p><p>In his years in Santa Fe Summit, Dr. Miranda said, he had spoken with only two or three neighbors, at most.</p><p>“We all sort of cherish the fact that we are isolated,” he said.</p><p>Julia Jacobs<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national stories across the United States with a focus on criminal justice.
