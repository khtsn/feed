The last time the contest was held, in 2023, France did not even place in the top three.</p><p>“It’s a real pride to bring France to the top again,” Paul Marcon, the 29-year-old French chef who led the team that won gold, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaNUFK1w5Do" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a>.</p><p>Mr. Marcon’s victory on Monday was also, for some, a victory for French cuisine itself.</p><p>The country reigned as the undisputed king of 20th-century European fine dining — even the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/gastronomy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">word “gastronomy” itself</a> comes from French. But Denmark, the seat of New Nordic cooking, has become something of the Hamlet of the 21st.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Bocuse serves as an ideal place for an international culinary joust. Although there are many food contests, this one is widely seen as the true <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/dining/28bocuse-1.html" title="">Olympic Games of high gastronomy</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A chef preparing dishes to be judged.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“You have the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/arts/music/eurovision-how-to-watch.html" title="">Eurovision</a>, and then you have the Bocuse d’Or,” Nina Bauer, a Danish food historian, said in a phone call, referring to an international song competition. “You become famous if you win them, and not just in your own professional circle — but all over the world.”</p><p>Over the course of the 20 contests held since the Bocuse began in 1987, <a href="https://www.bocusedor-winners.com/en/chefs/?_medals=gold" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">France stands out as the dominant victor</a>: Its chefs have won almost half the time. In the first 10 competitions, from 1987 to 2005, France won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/dining/28bocuse.html" title="">five gold medals</a>.</p><p>But France’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2019/07/28/is-frances-culinary-reputation-in-decline/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hold</a> over fine dining <a href="https://www.skynews.com.au/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/frances-reputation-as-a-food-utopia-takes-a-belting-as-it-loses-culinary-crown-to-italy-and-spain-in-shock-new-survey-of-international-holidaymakers/news-story/2eb11c4a3d744659b01851c0b06cd4d8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/16/the-rise-and-fall-of-french-cuisine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/dining/at-bocuse-dor-americans-take-2nd.html" title="">slipped</a>, some say, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/dining/new-nordic-cuisine-draws-disciples.html" title="">Nordic</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/dining/norway-food-neo-fjordic-chef-christopher-haatuft.html" title="">chefs</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/travel/05iht-04choice.12566658.html" title="">have</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/dining/scandinavian-food-before-it-was-fashionable.html" title="">risen</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/travel/oslo-norway-restaurants-reviews.html" title="">prominence</a>. Since 2007, France won the Bocuse only four times in 10 competitions, including in 2021. Denmark won three times, the second most. Even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/dining/bocuse-dor-usa-win-chef-competition.html" title="">the United States managed to triumph</a>, in 2017.</p><p>“It has become a lot more about the chef’s creativity,” Ms. Bauer said. “There’s a lot more focus, I think, now about uniqueness — instead of just being the best version of the classics.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>This year, France again faced stiff competition from Denmark, which <a href="https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/01/24/denmark-pipes-france-in-culinary-olympic-games-the-bocuse-dor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">won the Bocuse in 2023</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chefs carrying different dishes on Mr. Marcon’s for presentation. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The things they’re making are amazing — it’s extremely tasty,” Sebastian Holberg, 26, the leader of the Danish team this year, said of his French peers. “And of course, they’re creative, too.”</p><p>He led Denmark’s team to the silver medal. Mr. Holberg described French techniques as the base, a standard upon which he and other Nordic chefs can riff. But sometimes, he said, France is holding onto classic techniques while Danish chefs are trying to experiment and let their ingredients lead.</p><p>“It’s just more elegance in the flavor — like, we don’t try to overcomplicate it,” Mr. Holberg said.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.bocusedor.com/en/finale" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finale of the Bocuse</a> on Sunday and Monday, France kept up its edge.</p><p>The 24 teams, each led by a chef and a helper, had five hours and 30 minutes to make a series of dishes on a platter, using a back of venison. Each team had to create a foie gras pie, a garnish based around a fruit from their own country and “16 closed, bi-colored ravioli, served hot, with a clarified venison consommé infused with tea.” And that, of course, had to be served to the judges in two teapots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tasting dishes during the contest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The chefs also made a dish in four hours and 40 minutes with celery (both stalk and root), stone bass and lobster. This, too, had requirements: “The celeriac root must be offered in two identical whole pieces,” but the chefs could do what they liked with the stalk.</p><p>For many, France’s win is a real “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5551953/2024/07/10/england-coming-home-three-lions/" title="">football’s coming home</a>” moment. The award is named after the acclaimed French chef Paul Bocuse, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/obituaries/paul-bocuse-dead.html" title="">who died in 2018</a>. It’s hosted on the outskirts of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/travel/things-to-do-lyon-france.html" title="">Lyon</a>, where Mr. Bocuse lived and cooked, a city that is known by many as the “World Capital of Gastronomy.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUKgaMGzF6k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videos</a> from the event, French fans waved the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFVNIVWo0Wn/?locale=maxwin%2Bslot%E3%80%90GB999.bet%E3%80%91.fupg&amp;hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tricolor flag</a> in triumph, as Mr. Marcon’s team hoisted him high onto their shoulders. With his medal glinting around his neck, he grinned, pumping his golden award in the air.</p><p>“It’s my childhood dream come true,” Mr. Marcon — whose father, Régis Marcon, won in 1995 — said in a statement in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFVtuNJItDM/?locale=maxwin%2Bslot%E3%80%90GB999.bet%E3%80%91.fupg&amp;hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram post</a> from the French team for the Bocuse d’Or.</p><p>“We succeeded together for France,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It’s a real pride to bring France to the top again,” Mr. Marcon said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Young Haitians’ Lives Disrupted: </strong>Robbed of their education and their prospects for the future, legions of Haitian children are the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/americas/haiti-children-schools.html">overlooked victims of the gang violence that has crippled the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cracking a Vast Art Fraud: </strong>In a remote Canadian city, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/canada/norval-morrisseau-art-fraud.html">a hardened detective and an angry rock star</a> brought down two criminal rings that had produced thousands of fake paintings sold as works by a celebrated Indigenous artist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drawing a Window Into the Middle East: </strong>The French cartoonist Riad Sattouf’s saga of his parents’ failed bicultural marriage, with its harsh depiction of life in rural Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/riad-sattouf-cartoons-france-syria.html">has become a literary sensation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside the Gaza Truce Negotiations: </strong>The Qatari prime minister, working with both the Biden administration’s envoy and a representative for Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html">formed an unlikely partnership to seal the cease-fire deal</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jair Bolsonaro’s Stay-Out-of-Jail Card: </strong>The former Brazilian president, squeezed by criminal investigations, is looking to Trump, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to shift his nation’s politics — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-trump-us.html">and maybe keep him a free man</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
