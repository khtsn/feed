The Treasury Department has faced questions in recent weeks after lieutenants of Mr. Musk who were assigned to the agency started scrutinizing the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s system, which directs payments across the federal government.</p><p>Gavin Kliger, a young software engineer who was brought into the Office of Personnel Management as part of the DOGE effort, worked at I.R.S. headquarters on Thursday, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. He will be assigned to the I.R.S. as a senior adviser to the acting commissioner. The tax agency is still working out the exact terms of his work at the I.R.S., though he is expected to have broad access to its systems, according to the two people.</p><p>As of Sunday evening, he had not yet gained access to sensitive I.R.S. data, the two people said.</p><p>The Washington Post reported <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier on Sunday</a> that the I.R.S. was considering a memorandum of understanding that would give DOGE staff members broad access to its systems, including the Integrated Data Retrieval System, which contains taxpayer accounts.</p><p>Attempts by Mr. Musk’s team to gain access to Treasury Department data have faced legal challenges, and efforts to scrutinize I.R.S. systems could encounter a similar fate.</p><p>This month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/nyregion/letitia-james-doge-suit.html" title="">19 state attorneys general</a> led by Letitia James of New York sued to block the Trump administration’s policy of allowing political appointees and “special government employees” led by Mr. Musk access to the Treasury Department’s payment systems. On Friday, a judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/musk-doge-treasury-data-lawsuit.html" title="">extended a court order blocking</a> that access and said she would decide soon whether to keep the restrictions in place until a final ruling was made, which could take months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The I.R.S. is preparing to lay off thousands of employees as soon as this week as part of the administration’s initiative to cut costs across the federal government.</p><p>The Biden administration was in the process of a multibillion-dollar overhaul of its systems, but Republicans have been working to rescind much of the agency’s funding.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that he hoped to upgrade the antiquated technology at the I.R.S.</p><p>“I have three goals: it’s collections, privacy and customer service,” Mr. Bessent said on Fox Business last week. “And I don’t think there’s anyone, anyone in the country, who thinks that they — that the I.R.S. has achieved its potential in either of those three.”</p><p>President Trump has long been a critic of the I.R.S., often complaining that it was overly aggressive in its audits of his finances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a fund-raising email on Saturday, Mr. Trump asked recipients whether he should authorize Mr. Musk’s team to audit the tax agency.</p><p>“Are you sick of being targeted and harassed by the I.R.S.?” Mr. Trump asked. “Well maybe it’s time that somebody audited them for a change!”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter, based in Washington.
