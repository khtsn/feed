Everybody on screen. Thank you. Thanks for joining us for this very special event, ‘Unite for America.’” “What would be your specific steps to strengthening the border?” “I take very seriously the importance of having a secure border. When the United States Congress, members of the Congress, including some of the most conservative Republicans, came up with a border security bill, Donald Trump called up those folks and said, ‘Don’t put that bill on the floor for a vote.’” “Will you reintroduce that?” “Absolutely, and when I am elected president of the United States, I will make sure that bill gets to my desk and I will sign it into law.” “Where were you physically shot?” “I was shot right here on my shoulder and then around here.” “The wrist.” “I’m in favor of the Second Amendment, and I’m in favor of assault weapons bans, universal background checks, red flag laws. These are just common sense.” “I thought it was so powerful at the convention when you said you have guns. No, at the debate. At the debate —” “I’m a gun owner. Tim Walz is a gun —” “I did not know that.” “If somebody breaks in my house, they’re getting shot. Sorry.” “Yes, yes, I hear that. I hear that.” “Probably should not have said that, but my staff will deal with that later.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-top-flzq/19election-live-harris-michigan-top-flzq-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The vice president answered questions from the audience, detailing her position on issues like immigration and gun control.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green"><img alt="Erica L.

Also joining virtually were celebrities that included Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jennifer Lopez, Tracee Ellis Ross and Meryl Streep.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But the most remarkable moments in the roughly 90-minute forum came when Ms. Winfrey did what she does best: orchestrating an interview that connects with everyday Americans whose experiences illustrate the strife of a country craving empathy. The discussions were heavy at times, with members of the audience — in person and at home — in tears.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Kamala Harris sits and leans forward with her hands clasped by her chin, as she listens to a woman in the foreground facing her." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/19/multimedia/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc/19election-live-harris-michigan-audience-hlgc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris listening to Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Thurman, the 28-year-old Georgia woman who died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat her complications from an abortion pill.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Harris has not often spoken off the cuff or at length about many issues since she catapulted to the top of the ticket after President Biden dropped out of the race. Here she addressed questions from the audience and Ms. Winfrey about issues like immigration and gun violence, and what would happen if her opponent, former President Donald J. Trump, didn’t accept the results of the election should he lose a second time.</p><p>Ms. Harris spoke more elaborately than she has before on the effects of illegal immigration — a key issue for voters and a vulnerability in her campaign. She cited the devastating effects of fentanyl, overwhelmed border patrol agents and strained resources for prosecuting transnational criminal organizations. She pointed out that a bill that Mr. Trump had helped kill in Congress would have helped confront these problems, and she vowed to resurrect that bill and sign it.</p><p>On abortion rights, one of her strongest issues after a Supreme Court with three Trump-appointed justices overturned Roe v. Wade, she yielded to those who have been affected.</p><p>The mother and sister of Amber Thurman spoke publicly for the first time about her death by sepsis after waiting 20 hours, an outcome of the state’s abortion ban, for a hospital to treat her complications from an abortion pill. Ms. Thurman’s story, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported by ProPublica</a>, has crystallized the consequences of restrictions on reproductive health.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Amber was not a statistic,” her mother said as members of the crowd teared up. “She was loved by a family, a strong family, and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed.”</p><p>Ms. Harris, who met with the family before the event, used the moment to highlight Mr. Trump’s abortion record. She will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/harris-abortion-georgia.html" title="">travel to Georgia on Friday</a> to deliver remarks on reproductive rights. “It’s a health care crisis,” she said on Thursday. “It’s a health care crisis that affects the patient and the profession.”</p><p>Also in the crowd at the forum, held outside Detroit, was Natalie Griffith, a 15-year-old student who was shot twice in algebra class by a classmate during a campus attack on Sept. 4 at <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/tag/crime-publicsafety/mass-shootings/apalachee-high-school-shooting" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apalachee High School</a>, also in Georgia. Her mother, Marilda Griffith, sobbed telling the story of how that day unfolded. </p><p>“The whole world needs to hear that we women, that have our children — we have a job,” Ms. Griffith said. “That job is to protect our children. That job is to protect our nation.”</p><p>Ms. Harris agreed, citing the “bone-chilling” sight of a sea of students raising their hands when, on tours across the country, she asks if they have participated in active-shooter drills. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Meryl Streep asked Ms. Harris how she was preparing for the “long slog of shenanigans” that may come should Mr. Trump not accept the election’s results and incite violence reminiscent of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>Ms. Harris said her team was ready for Mr. Trump to challenge the election: The “lawyers are working.” But she encouraged people to talk with their friends about misinformation, to protect poll workers and to not be afraid to vote.</p><p>Several hundred people attended the event at Studio Center. Other notable attendees included the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Jotaka Eaddy, a collaborator with Ms. Winfrey on the event and founder of Win With Black Women, the first group to draw tens of thousands of people <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/win-with-black-women-zoom-call-harris-organizers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to a Zoom fund-raiser</a> for Ms. Harris’s campaign.</p><p>Ms. Winfrey’s skill of drawing out the humanity and vulnerability of her subjects was on display, including with the fiercely guarded vice president.</p><p>At the beginning of the interview, Ms. Winfrey said she had noticed a change in Ms. Harris since she entered the race, as if a “veil dropped.” She asked if Ms. Harris had felt that, too. “I felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you, and with that comes a sense of purpose,” Ms. Harris said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Midway through the conversation, Ms. Harris acknowledged that she may have gotten too comfortable when Ms. Winfrey said she hadn’t known that Harris was a gun owner until the debate. “If somebody breaks in my house, they’re getting shot,” Ms. Harris said, then caught herself. “I probably should not have said that,” she said, laughing. “But my staff will deal with that later.”</p><p>An hour before the event, Mr. Trump’s campaign sent a statement accusing Ms. Harris of campaigning “with an out-of-touch celebrity, further confirming that the Democrat party is not the party of hardworking Americans — it is the party of elitists.”</p><p>Ms. Winfrey, a registered independent who had never spoken at a party convention before, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/oprah-winfrey-kamala-harris-dnc.html" title="">gave a full-throated endorsement</a> of Ms. Harris last month at the Democratic National Convention.</p><p>Ms. Winfrey’s endorsement is a coveted one, as she has largely shied away from politics, reserving her influence for a few major races. In 2007, she endorsed for president Barack Obama, then a senator of Illinois, and hit the campaign trail for him in Iowa.</p><p>In announcing the virtual rally, Ms. Winfrey said she wanted to use it to motivate people to vote.</p><p>During the event, which was also aimed at mobilizing volunteers to make phone calls and to knock on doors in their communities, Ms. Harris’s campaign manager stressed that it was still a “razor-thin race.”</p><p>Added Ms. Winfrey to the audience: “We love having you here, but the rah-rah moment is going to end, and then we need to get to work.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
