Andrew M. Cuomo, was expected to be the focal point of attack for the other eight Democratic candidates onstage Wednesday night.</p><p>It did not take long for that expectation to be realized.</p><p>In his first real confrontation with his opponents in the race, Mr. Cuomo defended his handling of the pandemic, denied the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation and said he would not be swayed by the wealthy donors who have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/01/nyregion/cuomo-donors-mayor.html" title="">poured millions into groups</a> allied with his campaign.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo, who has maintained a double-digit lead over the rest of the primary field in nearly every poll of the race, largely criticized Zohran Mamdani, the progressive state assemblyman who is in second place, as inexperienced and too far to the left. (The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, is running as an independent in the general election in November and did not participate in the debate.)</p><p>The two-hour debate descended into chaos on more than one occasion, as the candidates shouted at one another, the cacophony worsening when the moderators jumped in to interrupt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here are five takeaways from the debate. The primary will be held June 24.</p><h2 id="link-746a92ea">Cuomo and Trump were the common enemies.</h2><p>Mr. Cuomo’s rivals were determined to highlight his baggage and force him to address it, which created moments at which the former governor appeared frustrated and dismissive of the accusations.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/andrew-cuomo-investigation-doj.html" title="">federal investigation</a> examining whether he lied to Congress about nursing home deaths during the pandemic? Mr. Cuomo said that it was politically motivated.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/nyregion/cuomo-sexual-harassment-women.html" title="">sexual harassment allegations</a> by 11 women? Unfounded, Mr. Cuomo said, though he did acknowledge his apology to the women in 2021.</p><p>“I said at the time that if I offended anyone it was unintentional, but I apologize, and I say that today,” he said.</p><p>The prominent donors who have given generously to a super PAC supporting Mr. Cuomo, including DoorDash? (The food delivery service gave the super PAC $1 million.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Cuomo insisted he would not be influenced by the donations, even as Scott Stringer, a former city comptroller, said they were examples of “buying the mayoralty.”</p><p>“I don’t care who gave me what,” Mr. Cuomo said.</p><p>President Trump’s name was mentioned more than 80 times as the candidates sought to outline how they would stand up to him while defending the city against his retribution.</p><p>Mr. Mamdani said he would fight Mr. Trump’s budget cuts and threats of mass deportations.</p><p>“I am Donald Trump’s worst nightmare, as a progressive Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things that I believe in,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Zohran Mamdani, who is second in the polls, repeated one of his major attacks on Cuomo: that he is beholden to wealthy business interests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Yuki Iwamura</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-2cf314bb">Cuomo and Mamdani fought the most over corruption and experience.</h2><p>Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Mamdani had several heated exchanges over Mr. Cuomo’s record, Mr. Mamdani’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/mamdani-record-albany-mayor.html" title="">limited experience</a> and their respective views on Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Each candidate landed some punches.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo questioned whether Mr. Mamdani could lead the city.</p><p>“Donald Trump would go through Mr. Mamdani like a hot knife through butter,” Mr. Cuomo said. “He’s been in government 27 minutes. He passed three bills.”</p><p>Mr. Mamdani, for his part, said that Mr. Cuomo could not be trusted to confront President Trump because he was allied with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/nyregion/cuomo-super-pac-billionaire-donations.html" title="">some of the same wealthy donors</a> who supported the president.</p><p>“I don’t have to pick up the phone from Bill Ackman or Ken Langone,” he said, referring to the ultrawealthy business owners aligned with the president.</p><p>The debate ended with a tense exchange over Israel.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo said he would take his first trip as mayor to Israel and criticized Mr. Mamdani for not committing to going there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“His answer was no.

And the difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in D.C. I don’t have to pick up the phone from Bill Ackman or Ken Langone. I have to pick up the phone for the more than 20,000 New Yorkers who contributed an average donation of about $80 to break fund-raising records and put our campaign in second place.” Moderator: “Mr. Cuomo.” Moderator: “Mr. Cuomo, you want to respond to that?” “Yeah, please. You know, Mr. Mamdani is very good on Twitter and with videos, but he actually produces nothing for him to accuse me of lying. He also called President Obama a liar and said President Obama was evil. So, take everything with a grain of salt. Donald Trump would go through Mr. Mamdani like a hot knife through butter. He’s been in government 27 minutes. He passed three bills. That’s all he’s done. He has no experience with Washington, no experience in New York City. He would be Trump’s delight.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/arts/mamdani-cuomo-cover/mamdani-cuomo-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>WNBC-TV and WNJU-TV</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-a150801">Blake and Adams seized their moments in the spotlight.</h2><p>Michael Blake, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/nyregion/michael-blake-mayor-nyc.html" title="">former state assemblyman and White House aide</a> who is near the bottom in the polls, had a few memorable moments.</p><p>He regularly interjected throughout the debate, asking Mr. Cuomo to take responsibility for deaths in nursing homes during the pandemic and highlighting comments Mr. Cuomo made in 2008 that Mr. Blake, who is Black, said were racially insensitive toward former President Barack Obama.</p><p>(Mr. Cuomo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/nyregion/11cuomo.html" title="">referred to candidates who “shuck and jive,”</a> but said at the time that he was not referring to Mr. Obama.)</p><p>During a conversation about public safety, Mr. Blake abruptly turned the conversation to the sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Cuomo.</p><p>“The people who don’t feel safe are young women, mothers and grandmothers around Andrew Cuomo,” he said. “That’s the greatest threat to public safety in New York City.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Blake’s closing remarks were in Jamaican patois, as he said he would make his first visit as mayor to the Caribbean island, where his family is from.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adrienne Adams went after Mr. Cuomo for saying he had no political regrets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Yuki Iwamura</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker who entered the race later than her rivals, appeared calm and used several questions to highlight her experience in city government.</p><p>She landed her most notable punches after Mr. Cuomo said he had no regrets about his record as governor.</p><p>“No regrets when it comes to cutting Medicaid or health care?” Ms. Adams interjected. “No regrets when it comes cutting child care?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ms. Adams also accused him of slow-walking access to vaccines and personal protective equipment, which disproportionately harmed Black and Latino New Yorkers.</p><p>“Really, no regrets?” she said.</p><p>The issue is personal for her: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/nyregion/adrienne-adams-nyc-mayor-cuomo-covid.html" title="">Her father died of Covid-19 in 2020</a> after being unable to seek care at Elmhurst Hospital near his home in Queens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-19"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“The Democratic Party got to a point that we allowed Mr. Trump to be elected — that we’ve gotten to a point where rhetoric has no connection with reality.

No regrets when it comes to cutting child care. No regrets when it comes to slow-walking P.P.E. and vaccinations in the season of Covid to Black and brown communities.
