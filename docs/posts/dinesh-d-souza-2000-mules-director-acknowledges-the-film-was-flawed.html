A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/29/us/politics/2000-mules-trump-conspiracy-theory.html" title="">glitzy premiere at Mar-a-Lago</a> drew Donald J. Trump, the once and future president, as well as Republican luminaries and influential figures in the movement to discredit the 2020 election.</p><p>The surveillance videos used in the film were obtained by True the Vote, a right-wing election organization that was a partner in producing the film. In a statement on its website on Monday, the group said the film’s central premise “remains accurate” despite the apology.</p><p>The admission from Mr. D’Souza follows years of defiance: He had long argued that the evidence in his film was sound even as election experts at the state and local levels declared the conclusions unfounded. In 2022, the Republican attorney general of Arizona <a href="https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/202210141445.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked the F.B.I. to investigate True the Vote</a> for ignoring requests to share the documentary’s evidence.</p><p>The film helped demonize drop boxes as a fraudulent method of voting in the eyes of many Republicans.</p><p>Numerous Republican legislatures, including in battleground states like Georgia, sought to either ban or significantly restrict the use of drop boxes after the 2020 election. Lawsuits targeting drop boxes became commonplace. The right-leaning State Supreme Court in Wisconsin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/us/politics/wisconsin-drop-boxes.html" title="">banned most drop boxes for the state’s 2022 elections</a>, though that decision was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/wisconsin-ballot-drop-boxes.html" title="">reversed for this year’s contests</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the 2022 midterm elections, armed right-wing activists in Arizona patrolled the areas around drop boxes. An organizer of the effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/us/politics/federal-judge-allows-activists-to-stake-out-ballot-boxes.html" title="">said she had been inspired</a> by a trailer for “2000 Mules.” During this year’s elections, two drop boxes in Oregon and Washington <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/ballot-box-fires-oregon-washington.html" title="">were set on fire</a>, potentially destroying hundreds of ballots.</p><p>In his statement, Mr. D’Souza directly apologized to Mark Andrews, a Georgia voter featured in the film who sued its producers in 2022 for defamation. The film shows a clip of Mr. Andrews, with his face blurred out, placing ballots into a drop box near Atlanta, along with voice-over commentary by Mr. D’Souza calling the action “a crime” and adding, “These are fraudulent votes.” (A state investigation found that Mr. Andrews had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-entertainment-movies-crime-b3131ff301d8a418cfc6b0860c52b5e9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawfully cast ballots for himself and his family members</a>, who all lived at the same address.)</p><p>While Mr. Andrews’s face was blurred in the movie, unblurred versions of the same video were used to promote the documentary by a variety of conservative news outlets. Those outlets included Tucker Carlson’s former show on Fox News and a show hosted by Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, and produced by Salem Media Group, which was a co-producer of “2000 Mules.”</p><p>“I owe this individual, Mark Andrews, an apology,” Mr. D’Souza said. “I now understand that the surveillance videos used in the film were characterized on the basis of inaccurate information provided to me and my team. If I had known then that the videos were not linked to geolocation data, I would have clarified this and produced and edited the film differently.”</p><p>In May, Salem Media Group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/us/politics/2000-mules-salem-georgia-apology.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="">issued a statement</a> apologizing to Mr. Andrews for harm caused by the film. The organization also said that it had taken “2000 Mules” off its platforms and that it would no longer distribute the film and an accompanying book.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It was never our intent that the publication of the ‘2000 Mules’ film and book would harm Mr. Andrews,” the group <a href="https://investor.salemmedia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/847/salem-media-statement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said at the time</a>.</p><p>The lawsuit against Salem was dismissed four days after the organization apologized.</p><p>Mr. Andrews’s lawsuit against Mr. D’Souza and True the Vote has continued, with motions for summary judgment expected to be filed next week.</p><p>In its statement, True the Vote said that it had no editorial control over the movie, promotional videos and accompanying book, and that Mr. Andrews had not been part of the data analysis it performed. The organization said that it had told Mr. D’Souza that Mr. Andrews was not a part of the study, but that “despite this, D’Souza’s team included a blurred video of this individual in their ‘2000 Mules’ movie and book productions.”</p><p>In his statement, Mr. D’Souza said he was apologizing “not under the terms of a settlement agreement or other duress, but because it is the right thing to do, given what we have now learned.”</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Andrews declined to comment.</p><p>Despite his apology, Mr. D’Souza insisted in his statement that “the underlying premise of the film holds true.”</p><p>He did not provide specific evidence to bolster that claim.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
