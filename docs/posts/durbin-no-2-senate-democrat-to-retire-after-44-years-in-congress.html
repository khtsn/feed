Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat for two decades and a leading liberal voice on Capitol Hill, announced on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election next year, closing out a 44-year congressional career focused on immigration, the federal justice system and anti-smoking initiatives.</p><p>The decision by Mr. Durbin, 80, was widely expected and will immediately touch off a crowded competition for a rare Senate vacancy in his solidly blue state. It also intensifies a generational shift in the chamber as he becomes the fifth sitting senator to announce a retirement, all of them over the age of 65.</p><p>In an interview ahead of his announcement, Mr. Durbin, who is in his fifth Senate term, said it was not an easy choice to step away from his prime perch doing battle with President Trump, whom he considers a dire threat to democracy. He described moments in recent days “where I thought, ‘Man, I don’t want to miss this fight.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“But you know,” he continued, “I have to be honest about this. There are good people in the wings, good people on the bench ready to serve, and they can fight this fight just as effectively as I can. There comes a point where you have to face reality that this is the time to leave for me.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23DC-DURBIN-ossoff-qzfg/23DC-DURBIN-ossoff-qzfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23DC-DURBIN-ossoff-qzfg/23DC-DURBIN-ossoff-qzfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/multimedia/23DC-DURBIN-ossoff-qzfg/23DC-DURBIN-ossoff-qzfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Senators Richard J.

They include Representatives Lauren Underwood, 38; Raja Krishnamoorthi, 51; and Robin Kelly, 68, along with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, who is 59.</p><p>It is likely to be one of several highly competitive primaries in both parties over the next 18 months, as Democrats embark on an uphill slog to reclaim the Senate majority and Republicans grasp to hang on to it.</p><p>Mr. Durbin’s departure will reverberate in the Senate, where he played a prominent role on a host of big issues and was considered a forceful advocate of party positions. He was among the first to push for a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, a group that came to be known as Dreamers that became the focal point of successive failed efforts to overhaul immigration laws.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>His retirement also will open up a top Democratic leadership position for the first time in a decade.</p><p>Mr. Durbin entered Congress in 1983 after narrowly defeating an 11-term Republican incumbent in a newly redrawn Springfield-area House district more favorable to Democrats. As a junior member of that chamber, Mr. Durbin led the drive to ban smoking on airplanes, helping to usher in the smoke-free movement with legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988.</p><p>“That has to be the most significant thing I’ve done in terms of changing America,” Mr. Durbin said. “I was trying to get away from a health hazard, and I ended up reaching a tipping point on tobacco in America. I didn’t see that coming.”</p><p>He won his Senate seat in 1996 after his mentor and friend Paul Simon retired and endorsed Mr. Durbin to succeed him, a significant boost for an Illinois politician from outside the Chicago area.

Mr. Durbin also brushed aside suggestions that he abandon the committee’s so-called blue slip tradition, which gives senators veto power over judiciary and law enforcement picks for their states, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/schumer-trump-new-york-prosecutors.html" title="">a lever that Democrats are now employing to thwart Mr. Trump</a>.</p><p>After the 2004 election, Mr. Durbin was encouraged by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, then the new Democratic leader, to seek the party’s second-ranking slot, known as the party whip. A few years later, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York became the third-ranking party leader, allowing Senate Democrats to take advantage of his fund-raising and strategic skills after he managed the party’s campaign arm.</p><p>The three worked closely at the top of the party, creating a sensitive situation when Mr. Reid announced in 2015 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/senator-harry-reid-retire.html" title="">that he would not run again</a>. He backed Mr. Schumer for the top job over Mr. Durbin, who had roomed with Mr. Schumer in a Capitol Hill rowhouse. Mr. Durbin also supported Mr. Schumer for the top post and held on to his own leadership job, resulting in his becoming one of the longest-serving party leaders in congressional history.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Schumer joined numerous Senate Democrats in praising Mr. Durbin, calling him “a trusted partner, one of the most respected voices in the Senate for decades.” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii and one of those interested in succeeding Mr. Durbin in leadership, called him a “titan of the Senate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“For more than four decades, Senator Dick Durbin has been a pillar of leadership, integrity, and unwavering dedication to the people of his home state of Illinois and the nation,” Mr. Schatz said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Durbin is one of the remaining senators who relishes a chance to mix it up on the floor with lawmakers across the aisle.

It never became law, but it laid the foundation for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was announced by President Barack Obama in 2012 and protected hundreds of thousands of immigrants from deportation. Mr. Trump has tried to end the program, and it remains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/daca-immigration-deportation.html" title="">under legal threat</a>.</p><p>“It’s been a long and challenging decision process,” Mr. Durbin said about retiring. “But I’ve been around the Senate long enough to realize that whatever your area of major interest in the Senate, you’re always going to minor in aging.”</p><p>Nick Corasaniti<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Carl Hulse is the chief Washington correspondent, primarily writing about Congress and national political races and issues.
