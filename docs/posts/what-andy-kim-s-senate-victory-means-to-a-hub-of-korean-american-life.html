On weekends, his family drove from their home in Evesham to attend a Korean church in Philadelphia and to shop at a Korean grocery store.</p><p>As a child, and early in his career as a foreign policy adviser in Washington, he said he chafed at being seen primarily as Asian. “How do I do foreign policy if my own government treats me like I’m foreign?” <a href="https://x.com/AndyKimNJ/status/1373282035633119233" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote</a> in 2021 about getting a letter years earlier from his employer, the State Department, that banned him from working on Korea issues “just because of my last name.”</p><p>“I struggled with my Korean identity a lot,” he said in an interview, adding, “I felt like nothing I can do can ever make me just American.”</p><p>In Korean culture, professions likely to lead to financial security, including medicine and law, are held in high regard. Skills typically associated with politics — public speaking, assertiveness — are prioritized less, said Min Choi, a college professor who is raising her two children in Fort Lee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jini Park, 41, with her husband, Jae Park, 40, and their daughter, Karis, 2, at their home in Leonia.

That has elevated him to folk hero status among activists who had been fighting for years to abolish a ballot design that gave Democratic and Republican Party bosses outsize sway in elections.</p><p>“Yes, he’s the super nice guy who picked up the garbage,” said Ellen Park, who moved from New York City to Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 15 years ago, and in 2021 was elected to the State Assembly, becoming the first East Asian member of the Legislature.</p><p>“But he’s not just that. He’s tough. And he’s going to fight.”</p><p>A question pollsters chose to ask in January showed the stereotypes about Asians that Mr. Kim had to face in the election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I never would have imagined that at some point Korean would be cool,” Representative Kim said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-21"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many children attend Korean American preschools.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Not all Korean Americans in New Jersey voted for Representative Kim.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As he was locked in a Democratic primary battle with New Jersey’s first lady, Tammy Murphy, an <a href="https://www.fdu.edu/academics/centers-institutes/fdu-poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">independent poll</a> by Fairleigh Dickinson University asked voters to rank Mr. Kim on a sliding scale of masculinity. He scored a 6.2 — a rating “significantly less masculine” than other male candidates, according to the survey, a factor it concluded was driving down his approval rating.</p><p>“These findings are in line with academic research showing that men of East Asian descent are seen as less masculine than members of other racial and ethnic groups,” the FDU Poll concluded.</p><p>Mr. Kim said he was intent on combating misconceptions that have contributed to a rise in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/nyregion/asian-hate-crimes.html" title="">Asian hate crimes</a>.
