In Europe, especially, train travel is surging as an environmental alternative to short-haul flights, with more night trains, high-speed routes and transnational collaboration between rail companies. Political ties between European countries may be jittery, but the cities are more linked than ever.</p><p>Trains also return us to the romance of travel. The pacifying hours invite reading and contemplation as the landscapes reveal the geography between destinations — the Zen opposite of air travel’s frittered tedium.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/03/multimedia/03trains-europe-trip-trains-03-ptgv/03trains-europe-trip-trains-03-ptgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/03/multimedia/03trains-europe-trip-trains-03-ptgv/03trains-europe-trip-trains-03-ptgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/03/multimedia/03trains-europe-trip-trains-03-ptgv/03trains-europe-trip-trains-03-ptgv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A young woman sits on a train, eyes closed, as trees and land stream by.

However, there’s a vibe shift at <a href="https://rotefabrik.ch/de/programm.html#/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rote Fabrik</a>, a factory that has become a scruffy center for alternative culture, where a new generation is packing the calendar with concerts, parties and drag shows. In its graffiti-encrusted courtyard, D.J.s blasted house music at a day rave I attended, while a packed “Queer Tango” class proceeded inside. For all of Zurich’s predictable orderliness, there’s also a thriving and unruly flip side.</p><p>Across the lake, the <a href="https://pavillon-le-corbusier.ch/en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Le Corbusier pavilion</a>, a radical 1967 home-turned-museum, stood like a giant stack of rainbow toy blocks. Hopping on the ferry to the center, I stopped by <a href="https://heisswein.ch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heisswein,</a> an unpretentious natural wine bar serving small plates and its own pickled vegetables.
