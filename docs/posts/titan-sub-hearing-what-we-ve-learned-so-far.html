David Lochridge, a former director of marine operations at OceanGate, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9tqlpARlqQ&amp;list=PLgOje37c-b1NswzbM8kMEGRrdup_xwlW9&amp;index=9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testified</a> that the company’s ethos centered on making money. OceanGate charged adventurers up to $250,000 to see the wreckage of the Titanic up close, but offered little by way of serious engineering for safe products. “It was all smoke and mirrors,” Mr. Lochridge said of the company’s operations. He said he was fired in 2018 after raising safety concerns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tony Nissen, a former engineering director at the company, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avp_-wN3ekA&amp;list=PLgOje37c-b1NswzbM8kMEGRrdup_xwlW9&amp;index=10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he had told Stockton Rush, an OceanGate founder, in 2019 that the craft was “not working like we thought it would.” As a result, the engineer kept the submersible from making a dive to the Titanic ruins that year. Then he was fired.</p><p>Phil Brooks, who became the company’s engineering leader in 2021, said OceanGate’s financial woes contributed to his decision to leave the company just months before the Titan and its crew were lost. “The company was economically very stressed,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw0rnBv-Pa8&amp;list=PLgOje37c-b1NswzbM8kMEGRrdup_xwlW9&amp;index=6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testified</a>.

That claim also appears in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/us/oceangate-titan-submersible-titanic-lawsuit.html" title="">$50 million lawsuit</a> brought in August against OceanGate by the family of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/science/paul-henri-nargeolet-titanic-titan-submersible.html" title="">Paul-Henri Nargeolet</a>, one of the five victims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Tym Catterson, a former contractor for OceanGate, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avp_-wN3ekA&amp;list=PLgOje37c-b1NswzbM8kMEGRrdup_xwlW9&amp;index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testified</a> that he was certain the two dropped weights, totaling just 70 pounds out of hundreds that Titan carried, had been jettisoned to achieve neutral buoyancy — that is, the ability to float effortlessly underwater, not sinking or rising. He said that state of weightlessness helped the craft to better control its movements as it neared the seabed, not to begin an emergency rush to the surface.</p><p>Mr. Catterson added that the deep voyagers “had no idea” they faced an imminent implosion. “Nobody was suffering in there,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-3121c2ae">Why did Titan implode?</h2><p>That’s the hardest question, and it probably won’t be fully answered until the Coast Guard makes its official accident report public, which may not happen until next year.</p><p>Critics had long faulted Titan’s design as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/14/us/titan-submersible-implode-design.html" title="">a maverick approach</a> that featured many departures from proven submersible designs.

The ocean’s crushing pressures, he said, could have forced Titan’s hull to bend ever so slightly in the middle, causing its ends to pull back from the metallic end domes and weaken the glue joint with each dive. Eventually, he said, the mounting stresses gave way to the implosion.</p><p>Donald Kramer, a materials engineer with the National Transportation Safety Board, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YupblW5tgiM&amp;list=PLgOje37c-b1NswzbM8kMEGRrdup_xwlW9&amp;index=4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testified</a> to a different problem.

It may lead to regulatory reform, such as the mandatory institution of safety certification for deep submersibles.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
