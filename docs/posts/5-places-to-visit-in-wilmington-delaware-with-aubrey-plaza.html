    <h1>5 Places to Visit in Wilmington, Delaware, With Aubrey Plaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Wilmington, Del., is often in the news as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/style/president-biden-wilmington-delaware-supporters-withdrawal.html" title="">the hometown of President Biden</a> and as a hub for corporate litigation, but it’s hardly on tourists’ radar. It has no theme park, no professional sports teams, no famous regional cuisine that demands a pilgrimage.</p><p>But if Wilmington occupies a kind of blank space in the American mind, that’s fine by the actress Aubrey Plaza, who grew up there. Ms. Plaza, 40, whose credits include the TV shows “Parks and Recreation” and “The White Lotus,” and the new film, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/movies/my-old-ass-review.html" title="">My Old Ass</a>,” calls Wilmington “this magical little gem in the country, this little secret.”</p><p>Ms. Plaza is known for her deadpan humor and weirdness, but get her talking about Wilmington and she becomes an enthusiastically earnest tour guide, telling you her favorite local cafe, <a href="https://www.brewhaha.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brew HaHa!</a>, recommending the red-sauce joint <a href="https://mrsrobinos.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mrs. Robino’s</a> and sharing local legends, like the one about the allegedly haunted “<a href="https://wjbr.com/2021/09/20/the-haunted-legend-of-the-duponts-devils-road-and-the-cult-house/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Devil’s Road</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11aubreyplaza-hclt/11aubreyplaza-hclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11aubreyplaza-hclt/11aubreyplaza-hclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/11/multimedia/11aubreyplaza-hclt/11aubreyplaza-hclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A portrait of Aubrey Plaza, who has long brown hair pulled to one side of her face and brown eyes.

Wilmington has abundant green spaces, institutions such as the <a href="https://delart.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Delaware Art Museum</a> and <a href="https://www.decontemporary.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Delaware Contemporary</a>, and more than 40 pocket neighborhoods, including its own Little Italy.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s got a small-town vibe, but it has every kind of neighborhood and community in the tiniest concentrated city,” said Ms. Plaza, who now lives in Los Angeles but returns to Wilmington regularly to visit family.</p><p>There is also a level of sophistication to Wilmington uncommon in a city of its size, owing to the presence of so many corporations and legal professionals (Ms. Plaza’s mother is a lawyer), and to the legacy of the du Pont family, which founded its namesake company there and built grand mansions around town. One of them, the <a href="https://www.nemoursestate.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nemours Estate</a>, a 77-room chateau modeled on the Palace of Versailles, is now a museum.</p><p>As a kid, Ms. Plaza remembers being intrigued by the mysterious <a href="https://www.dupont.com/locations/wilmington-delaware-the-experimental-station.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DuPont Experimental Station</a> research laboratory. “They’re making Teflon or whatever they’re doing,” she said. “It’s very ’80s Spielberg-style.”</p><p>Here are Ms. Plaza’s five favorite places in Wilmington.</p><h2 id="link-76f01a76">1. <a href="https://www.friendsofwilmingtonparks.org/our-parks/rockford-park/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rockford Park</a></h2></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rockford Tower, a 115-foot-tall structure in Rockford Park, offers a view from the top.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Neal Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rockford Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Neal Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This 104-acre park in the Highlands neighborhood features a large meadow that overlooks Brandywine Creek.

Her older cousin started doing plays there, and Ms. Plaza tagged along one summer. “I just thought, ‘Wow, the guts these kids have to stand up and audition in front of other kids,’” she said. Ms. Plaza “got hooked” at age 11, and the Drama League became her second home. The group in which Ms. Plaza came up included John Gallagher Jr., who starred in the Broadway musical “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/theater/reviews/16awak.html" title="">Spring Awakening,</a>” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/fashion/weddings/a-shy-and-logical-guy-finds-his-open-and-wild-match.html" title="">Keith Powell</a>, of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/arts/television/tina-fey-signs-off-30-rock-broken-barriers-behind-her.html" title="">30 Rock</a>.” <a href="https://www.wilmingtondramaleague.org/wdl-2024-2025-season" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The league’s 2024-25 season</a> includes the musicals “Mary Poppins” and “The Full Monty.”</p><h2 id="link-72d3b4c2">3.

At the bottom of the hill is Brandywine Creek, a gentle waterway. “We used to swim in it.
