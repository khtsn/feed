She was 86.</p><p>In 1979, Ms. Ledbetter got a job at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Gadsden, Ala. “We needed that money to pay college tuition and the mortgage,” she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z89V1dJJ-yY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said at Forbes Magazine’s women’s summit</a> in 2021.</p><p>At first, Ms. Ledbetter earned the same as her male counterparts, she said. But over time, her pay dropped “way out of line” compared to that of her male peers — unbeknown to her. At the factory, she said in 2021, employees could lose their jobs for sharing information about their salaries. It was not until 1998 that Ms. Ledbetter found out, by receiving an anonymous note, that she in fact earned much less than men working the same position.</p><p>“I was devastated,” she said.</p><p>In a 2018 Opinion essay in The Times, Ms. Ledbetter wrote that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/opinion/lilly-ledbetter-metoo-equal-pay.html" title="">she was also sexually harassed</a> early on in her tenure at Goodyear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After finding out about the pay discrepancy, Ms. Ledbetter went home and talked to her husband. “And we decided to fight,” she said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9YTvOXAkWc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a speech</a> at the Democratic National Convention in 2012.</p><p>Ms. Ledbetter filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1998 and a lawsuit against Goodyear in 1999. In 2003, she won her case at a federal court in Alabama, with the jury awarding her $3.8 million. (In a 2009 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2009/02/11/100557186/lilly-ledbetter-and-the-fight-for-gender-equality" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview with NPR</a>, Ms. Ledbetter said that the sum was reduced to a $300,000 cap and $60,000 in back pay.)</p><p>But she did not receive any of that money, she told NPR. </p><p>The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, which in 2007 ruled in favor of Goodyear in a 5-4 decision, saying that Ms. Ledbetter had filed her suit too late (more than 180 days) after the initial decision to pay her less than men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Barack Obama signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, with Ms. Ledbetter standing behind him.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Crowley/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion, Ms. Ledbetter said, inspired her to take the case to Congress. In 2009, Congress approved legislation that expanded workers’ rights to sue in such cases. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/us/politics/05rights.html" title="">changed the time limit</a> so that each discriminatory paycheck — and not just the first one — resets the 180-day limit to file a claim.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It was the first bill that former President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/us/politics/30ledbetter-web.html" title="">signed into law</a>.</p><p>“It is fitting that with the very first bill I sign, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, we are upholding one of this nation’s first principles: that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness,” Mr. Obama said.</p><p>Ms. Ledbetter made it to the White House again in 2014, standing with a group of women behind Mr. Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/us/politics/obama-signs-measures-to-help-close-gender-gap-in-pay.html" title="">as he signed two executive measures</a> that would make it easier for women to learn whether they had been cheated by employers.</p><p>Ms. Ledbetter was born Lilly McDaniel in Alabama to J.C. McDaniel, a mechanic, and Edna Smith McDaniel. She is survived by a daughter, Vickie Ledbetter Saxon; a son, Phillip Ledbetter; and several grandchildren. Ms. Ledbetter’s husband, Charles Ledbetter, died in 2008.</p><p>In a statement after her death, <a href="https://barackobama.medium.com/my-statement-on-the-passing-of-lilly-ledbetter-6f2c7d2d04af" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Obama wrote</a>: “Lilly Ledbetter never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work.”</p><p>Although Ms. Ledbetter would not see any money as a result of the 2009 legislation, she said that she had derived personal satisfaction from the bill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Goodyear will never have to pay me what it cheated me out of,” Ms. Ledbetter recalled saying after the signing ceremony. “In fact, I will never see a cent. But with the president’s signature today I have an even richer reward.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Ledbetter speaking at an event marking Equal Pay Day at the White House in 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><em>A full obituary will follow.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
