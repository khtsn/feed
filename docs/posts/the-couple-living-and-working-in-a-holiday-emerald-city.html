    <h1>The Couple Living and Working in a Holiday ‘Emerald City’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A decade ago, Emily Eerdmans and her husband, Andrew McKeon, were living in a rented Brooklyn Heights garden apartment with low ceilings. They both worked from home: His office was very small, with a door. Her office was the ivory damask sofa in the living room — a perch she described as the “ideal backdrop for my needlepoint pillow collection.”</p><p>Just before her 40th birthday, Ms. Eerdmans, a design historian, decided she needed her own space “to make money.”</p><p>She saw a New York Times real estate advertisement for a windowed basement office at 14 East 10th Street, an 1839 townhouse in Greenwich Village. For the next five years, she commuted to her gallery, Eerdmans Fine Art, from the apartment in Brooklyn. Customers ducked under the stoop to enter, the bathroom was freshly renovated and the landlady lived like a modernist on the patrician parlor floor right upstairs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/multimedia/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/multimedia/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/multimedia/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The entrance to a duplex apartment and gallery ducks under the stoop of a townhouse." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/multimedia/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/multimedia/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/multimedia/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/multimedia/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg/12holidaybazaar-01-qlfg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/45c911b2-6ada-58b5-b119-fa89a2644278" decoding="async" width="600" height="900"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The entrance to the duplex apartment and Eerdmans gallery is under the stoop of a townhouse on East 10th Street.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The landlady died and a year later, in the summer of 2020, Ms. Eerdmans began to envision a live-work duplex.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Fortunately, Mr. McKeon, too, could look past the many sloppy coats of paint and see the potential of the sublime neoclassical architecture. “Even in that glopity-glop state, you couldn’t miss the beauty,” he said. He agreed to give up their Brooklyn apartment to afford the extra rent on 10th Street.</p><p>Today, Ms. Eerdmans, 49, turns the duplex into a Christmas wonderland, taking liberties with the holiday decorations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emily Eerdmans and Andrew McKeon pose in the purple living room with their 3-year-old pug, Pompey, on a custom cloverleaf pouf in claret cotton velvet.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Outdoors is Kansas, and you come into the Emerald City,” she said.</p><p>Indeed, the upstairs parlor gallery at Eerdmans is lacquered Chic Lime, a Benjamin Moore green originally recommended by her mentor in decorating, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/obituaries/mario-buatta-dead.html" title="">Mario Buatta</a>. “Some people want environments to soothe, but mine need to energize,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Hanging on nails spiked into the shiny walls, an array of framed giclée prints by Tug Rice, a digital illustrator, is Eerdmans merchandise.</p><p>Private rooms in the apartment are off-limits to customers, but the public areas do double duty to connect them after business hours. If Ms. Eerdmans or Mr. McKeon, 66, wake up wanting a late-night snack, they walk down the hall, past the office, up the stairs from the basement, through the green parlor and into the adjoining kitchen.</p><p>Ms. Eerdmans has a background in design, including a master’s degree from Sotheby’s Institute of Art and work as a researcher and seller of English brown furniture at Hyde Park Antiques. But the duplex was her public debut as a decorator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A stained-glass star pendant hanging in the purple-glazed entry to the living room, with the green parlor gallery beyond.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Also an author, Ms. Eerdmans took lessons from décor doyens she has written about. The walls of a moody parlor that the couple uses as a private living room have a multilayered purple paint finish that was a favorite of Mr. Buatta. Jaguar-print polypropylene carpet she installed on the stairs recalls woven leopard rugs that Madeleine Castaing, the Paris antiques dealer and designer, installed to camouflage dirt. A coat of Kelly green paint hides “terrible” architectural flaws in the stairwell.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I just went crazy decorating,” Ms. Eerdmans said.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, she calls herself not precisely “a Christmas person.” Ms. Eerdmans’s great-grandfather was a Christian publisher in Grand Rapids, Mich. Her mother is an artist who moved to Ohio, followed a macrobiotic diet and eked out a living as a potter. Her mother, who was single, always put presents under the tree, but holidays “were kind of a downer,” Ms. Eerdmans said. “It would break my mother’s heart.”</p><p>When the family gained a stepfather who was Jewish, they also lit a menorah, for seven years, but she calls Christmas “the only holiday for us maximalists.”</p><p>When it comes to decorating, Ms. Eerdmans said, “Humor is really important to me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mirrored tree topper from Jones &amp; Daughters crowns a retail display of new and vintage costume jewelry from Romi Gold.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>That’s evident in this year’s theme for the holiday bazaar, Disco Christmas. She asked the interior designer Harry Heissmann, who is based in Newburgh, N.Y., for “jazz hands and pizazz.” Ms. Eerdmans originally hired him in 2022, he said, because “she knew I was a Christmas nut.” Last year, he dressed her big tree to resemble an enormous pineapple. Aloha, SpongeBob.</p><p>At the recent opening night of this year’s bazaar, the eighth, offering novelties and seasonal décor through Dec. 22, Ms. Eerdmans baffled her husband by hiring a gender illusionist. “Why do you need a Liza Minnelli impersonator?” asked Mr. McKeon, the executive director of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Most memorable parties transport guests to another dimension, Ms. Eerdmans said, and “it’s fun to go over the top.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Harry Heissmann, an interior designer, flanked by the tinsel-loaded tree and a $16,000 folding screen gilded and hand-painted by Angèle Boddaert.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>This year, the 13-foot fresh Christmas tree in the parlor is “for Andrew,” Mr. Heissmann said. Mr. McKeon grew up in the South Bronx, the youngest of eight children living in their grandmother’s Victorian mansion. The Christmas trees were very tall, the ceilings even taller.</p><p>“It’s a sentimental time,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Heissmann decorated the parlor tree with disco balls and tinsel icicles “to the max,” under a cloud of metallic balloons that Mr. McKeon taped to the ceiling. It’s a riff on Andy Warhol’s 1966 “Silver Clouds” installation, floating balloons puffed with helium and air. The print of a 1970 photo showing the back of Mr. Warhol’s head by Dustin Pittman, the nightlife photographer, hangs in the basement and sells for $2,500 on the store website.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Eerdmans with Babs the cat and Pompey on a settee covered in vintage Yves Saint Laurent fashion fabric, in the downstairs gallery, where walls are hung with mylar and nightlife photos by Dustin Pittman.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The former basement office is now a gallery where small tinsel trees are hung with blown-glass pigeons and poop emoji ornaments, all for sale. The basement gallery walls sport mirrored mylar, and Mr. Heissmann hung a fringed tinsel miniskirt at the ceiling since he has had bad luck with fresh pine garlands indoors. “It’s not pretty getting out the vacuum every day to suck needles off the floor,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>After the bazaar ends, the couple will load up their golden British Shorthair Cat, Babs, and pug, Pompey, and drive eight hours to Castine, Maine, where they have a seven-bedroom villa. A 1920s Spanish colonial revival by William Lawrence Bottomley, the New York society architect, the villa was known locally as “the pink palace,” even after a former owner whitewashed its stucco exterior.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Belgian black marble living room mantle has silver-painted citrus pomanders, magnolia garland, and 19th Century gilded Regency candelabras with tapers hand-painted by Anna Power ($38 a pair in the Eerdmans bazaar).</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Mr. McKeon plans to cut yet another tree in the woods and set the library mantel at the villa with a century-old, tabletop ceramic crèche from Vatican City. (It was a gift to his parents from a favorite nun.) Ms. Eerdmans moved her mother into the old chauffeur apartment above the former garage, and a crew has already repainted half the stucco in a shell pink. Ms. Eerdmans shared plans to have white shutters on the outside, with her characteristic enthusiasm, but she reported that her husband “said he would divorce me if I got a pet white peacock.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Dutch door in the bedroom opens to the backyard, and the chintz teddy bear on the couple’s bed belonged to the Prince of Chintz, Mario Buatta.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>For now, the couple is staying in the bedroom of the duplex with a door that opens out to the backyard. The walls are papered with a print from the 2017 Vogue Living collection that Schumacher developed with Hamish Bowles — just one more very personal restoration of the sort usually reserved for apartments people own.</p><p>“Life is too short. Why waste a single day living in a dingy white box?” Ms. Eerdmans said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Art and Museums in New York City</h2><h3>A guide to the shows, exhibitions and artists shaping the city’s cultural landscape.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Once-Sinful, Now Safe:</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/arts/luna-luna-art-carnival-the-shed.html">New York version of Luna Luna, an art carnival</a>, has lost the anarchic charge it was born with almost four decades ago, though a new act may thrill the kids.</p></li><li><p><strong>World’s Priciest Dinosaur Fossil:</strong> The billionaire Kenneth Griffin, who bought the stegosaurus fossil for $44.6 million, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/arts/most-expensive-stegosaurus-american-museum-of-natural-history.html">lending it to the American Museum of Natural History</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Met Museum’s New Modern Wing:</strong> The architect Frida Escobedo has drawn on her Mexican heritage in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/arts/design/met-museum-frida-escobedo-architecture-tang-wing-art.html">reimagining the galleries for Modern and contemporary art</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cracking the Code of the Art World:</strong> Ouattara Watts, a seminal but overlooked artist, stayed under the radar for decades.
