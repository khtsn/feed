Called La Divina, Callas, too, was exalted and scorned by critics and fans. Her personal life was examined, interrogated and written about. (She had a long relationship with the shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis.) And she, too, was described as intense and elusive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/17/archives/maria-callas-53-is-dead-of-heart-attack-in-paris-ivlarea-callas-is.html" title="">Callas died in 1977</a>, at 53, with only her housekeeper and butler nearby.</p><p>Jolie told me she identified with Callas’s isolation. “Loneliness is not a bad thing,” she said.</p><p>“We’re both seen as strong, but actually we’re very vulnerable and human,” she added. “I don’t think either one of us is necessarily comfortable being public<em>.”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jolie on learning to sing: “To find my voice and my breath, I had to drop all the things that were protecting me and open up again.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“Maria,” which opened this week in select theaters and goes to Netflix on Dec. 11, is Jolie’s return to the screen after a three-year hiatus. The film has already prompted Oscar chatter around her performance, though she says her aim was to be true to Callas and to produce something that would please opera fans. (She won the supporting actress Academy Award in 2000 for her portrayal of a psychiatric patient in “Girl, Interrupted.”)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>To play Callas, Jolie took voice lessons for seven months; learned arias by Puccini, Verdi, Donizetti and Bellini; and studied clips of Callas on YouTube, mastering her smile, her posture, the way she moved her hands, her peculiar way of speaking. While Jolie’s singing voice is rarely audible in the film — it was blended to varying degrees with Callas’s — she grew confident enough to sing before large crowds of extras, at one point filming <strong>the mad scene from Donizetti’s “Anna Bolena”</strong> on the hallowed stage of Teatro alla Scala in Milan for four hours.</p><p>That evening at the Met, Jolie kept a distance from the crowd.

His mother worshiped Callas and played her cassettes in the car.</p><p>“I had this ghost of grandiose performance in my head,” he said. “She was a mythical figure.”</p><p>As Larraín considered options for the final installment in his trilogy imagining the interior lives of prominent 20th-century women, Callas beckoned. “Jackie” (2016) starred Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy (who, as it happened, would later go on to marry Onassis, leaving Callas bereft); and in “Spencer” (2021), Kristen Stewart played Princess Diana.</p><p>For Callas, Larraín wanted an actress who could create “our Maria,” he said — not simply imitate her. He called Jolie, who had reached out after seeing his earlier work.</p><p>“If there’s truth, beauty, emotion, vulnerability and fragility, then you have a character,” he said. “And if you have a character, then you have a movie.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Working with the screenwriter Steven Knight, Larraín turned the focus to the final days of the singer’s life. In “Maria,” Callas struggles to stage a comeback as she faces the reality of a damaged voice. The film portrays her strained romance with Onassis (Haluk Bilginer); her addiction to sedatives; and her difficult childhood (born in New York to Greek immigrants, she moved to Greece with her mother and sister in 1937, when she was 13).</p><p>Larraín picked music that he loved and felt would connect to the real-life drama of Callas’s life. “This movie is about someone who became the tragedies that she played onstage,” he said.</p><p><strong>“Ave Maria” from Verdi’s “Otello” provides a prayer</strong> at the film’s start. The melancholy <strong>“Vissi d’arte” from “Tosca” accompanies Callas’s final moments.</strong></p><p>“Opera,” he said, “is a state of grace.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Diva on diva: “They really got her hands,” Jolie said of Callas’s portrait. “I love that.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The soprano Lise Davidsen, who sang the title role in “Tosca,” with Jolie. “You were just transcendent,” Jolie told her.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>WHEN JOLIE FOUND OUT</strong> that learning to sing opera would be a requirement to play Callas, she panicked. (“You can’t cheat,” Larraín told her.) For years, she had carried the trauma of a boyfriend telling her she had a bad voice and that she should be grateful she had other talents.</p><p>“It was nasty, and it was more than once,” she said. “Then I stopped singing.”</p><p>She told Larraín that she had “a lot of emotion and pain that I did not feel like letting go.” She was not very familiar with classical music; she had grown up listening to punk bands like the Clash. And she wasn’t sure she had the technique to sing — until that point, she had avoided even “Happy Birthday.”</p><p>Larraín brought in the vocal coach Eric Vetro, who started with breathing and posture exercises and helped Jolie stretch her range and resonance. Jolie thought she had a low voice. But it turned out that, like Callas, she was a soprano.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At her first lesson she cried, overwhelmed by the emotional and physical challenges.</p><p>“To find my voice and my breath,” she said, “I had to drop all the things that were protecting me and open up again.”</p><p>She gradually learned her first aria — <strong>Puccini’s “O mio babbino caro,”</strong> familiar to movie fans from the soundtrack of “A Room With a View” — with Callas’s recordings as her lodestar. She listened to Callas’s master classes, gleaning tips on vocal technique. And she studied Italian.</p><p>After about three months, Vetro noticed something remarkable: Jolie’s mouth was beginning to move like Callas’s — and she had developed a captivating presence as a singer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On the “Tosca” set at the Met.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Music men: Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Met’s music director, with Larraín.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I looked at her and said, ‘This is going to work,’” Vetro said. “The emotion was coming through her eyes, through her hands and through her voice.”</p><p>In the early days of production at a theater in Greece, Jolie was asked to sing on camera for the first time. It was the opening scene of “Maria,” in which she looks directly into the camera and sings “Ave Maria.” She allowed only a few people in the theater, including Larraín and her sons Maddox and Pax, who worked on the film.</p><p>Through an earpiece, Jolie listened to Callas; a vocal coach, the soprano Lori Stinson, gestured and mouthed the libretto in the background. Larraín, behind the camera, heard a live mix of Callas and Jolie.</p><p>Jolie was dispirited after her first attempt. They did six more takes.</p><p>“Something extraordinarily human and truthful was happening,” Larraín said. “I saw someone who was transforming herself.”</p><p>With her first aria done, Jolie grew more confident on set as she moved through bel canto classics from operas like Bellini’s “Norma” and “I Puritani.” Stinson, who worked with Jolie on location, sometimes pushed her fist into Jolie’s ribs to get her to open up her body and her mouth.</p><p>In the film, Callas’s voice is dominant. But there are hints of Jolie’s in some scenes. A rehearsal of “Anna Bolena” near the end, when Callas’s voice is in decline, is at certain moments about 60 percent Jolie, according to Larraín.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>For Jolie, the biggest test came in singing “Piangete voi?” from “Anna Bolena” at La Scala, a temple to opera where Callas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/arts/music/maria-callas-la-scala.html" title="">rose to fame</a>, appearing in more than two dozen productions. The aria was one of the most challenging on the list, but it was also Jolie’s favorite. Dressed in a costume that matched Callas’s, with a white headpiece and navy dress, she sang before a crowd of about 500 people.</p><p>“It’s like jumping off a cliff,” she said. “There was just nothing I could do but try to give everything I had.”</p><p>Singing became therapeutic for Jolie. “It’s very primal to let sound out,” she said. “We lock so much sadness and heaviness into our voices.”</p><p>It also reconnected her with the memory of mother, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/opinion/angelina-jolie-mothers-day.html" title="">Marcheline Bertrand</a>, who sang Rolling Stones hits to Jolie when she was young. Her mother’s death from cancer in 2007, at 56, made Jolie feel she no longer had the luxury of time.</p><p>“I don’t want to be comfortable or too relaxed,” she said. “I want to live fully.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Singing became therapeutic for Jolie. “It’s very primal to let sound out,” she said. “We lock so much sadness and heaviness into our voices.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>ON A WINDY AUTUMN</strong> morning, the day of the “Tosca” performance at the Met, I met Jolie in a heavily perfumed suite at the Carlyle hotel, a few blocks from Central Park. She sat with perfect posture, sipping on a peppermint tea.</p><p>“This is the most fun I’ve ever had doing press,” she said. “I love the opera, so I’m excited for tonight.”</p><p>Larraín had suggested, without offering specifics, that I ask her about “the bull story.” But when I broached the subject, she seemed caught off guard.</p><p>“I don’t know if I can share that,” she said. She eventually offered a few details, saying that she had been upset by a bullfight she witnessed when young, and that she often thought about that bull, “this beautiful animal,” in preparing to play Callas.</p><p>“It was a big moment in my life — it was something that kind of shaped me, that then I’ve carried,” she said. She stopped herself, saying she would think more about what she wanted to share.</p><p>I asked her about the bull again that evening, during an intermission at “Tosca,” saying that it seemed to have deep meaning for her and that the public cared about what informed her artistry. She laughed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“I’m not telling you,” she said. “I’m not talking about it.”</p><p>Was the bull a victim? “No.” A symbol of resilience? “It’s more complicated than that.”</p><p>“The bull was the only way I could describe who Maria was to me, to Pablo,” she said, looking at Larraín. “You’re going to have to let this be our little secret. It’s a language between us.”</p><p>I had begun to feel a bit like Mandrax, the television interviewer in “Maria” who hounds Callas throughout the film with intrusive questions about her life and career. (Played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, he is named after the pills Callas is taking.)</p><p>Larraín said that Jolie, like Callas, knew when to let people in and when to push them out.</p><p>“She opens the gate for you to understand and feel what she’s feeling,” he said. “And then, out of nowhere, she’s out. And you cannot enter again. And then you wonder.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jolie and Larraín at “Tosca.” The title role was a signature one for Callas.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>I HAD BEEN WARNED</strong> before our interview that Jolie did not wish to discuss her personal life.</p><p>She and Pitt, with whom she had a romantic partnership for more than a decade, are still wrangling in court, a saga that has been described as the “<a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-trial-winery-drama.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s longest divorce</a>” and that continues to draw attention on gossip sites. Jolie has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/movies/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-lawsuit.html" title="">accused Pitt</a> of “physical and emotional abuse of her and their children” aboard a private jet in 2016. (Pitt has denied the accusations.) The two are now arguing over the matter of Château Miraval, a winery they owned jointly in France.</p><p>During intermission at the Met, when we were alone in the box, I asked Jolie what it was like to be her in this moment. “I’m feeling a little uncomfortable being so public again,” she said, adding that she preferred the security of hiding inside characters.</p><p>She had described her time away from acting as a period of discovery and confrontation with herself. What had she learned?</p><p>She broke eye contact and struggled to offer a reply, saying she was concerned about revealing too many truths.</p><p>“When you are stripped of so many things that make you feel safe and whole, you really sit with what matters to you and what you want to give every breath in your body for,” she said. “In the end, I found a lot of softness.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Jolie has said she was dismayed to learn that an artist of Callas’s caliber was asked in interviews about her personal life, including her relationship with Onassis, who married Jackie Kennedy in 1968.</p><p>Jolie was particularly bothered by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJaWeRm1YcA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“60 Minutes” interview</a> that aired in 1974.

She said she hoped that despite all that, Callas was able to “feel safe to be soft and hopefully eventually rediscover a level of joy.”</p><p>Had Jolie found joy again?</p><p>“I don’t know about that,” she said. “But I hope for it.

She and Larraín, both raised as Catholics, had enjoyed dissecting the staging’s religious imagery. Jolie said she had become fond of the phrase “Tosca’s kiss,” a line uttered by Floria Tosca, the title character, before she kills the police chief Scarpia. And she and Larraín were excited to see children in the audience, a sign, they said, of the wide appeal of opera.</p><p>Jolie said she had been particularly affected in the second act, when Tosca sings “Vissi d’arte”:</p><p><em>I lived for art, I lived for love/I never harmed a living soul.</em></p><p>Jolie knows the aria well: She sings it in the final scenes of “Maria,” as an anguished Callas, at home in a nightgown, prepares to die.</p><p>“There’s a heaviness,” Jolie said, “and there’s a real beauty.”</p><p>In a dressing room backstage, she and Larraín greeted the Met’s music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, and Lise Davidsen, the renowned soprano who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/arts/music/review-lise-davidsen-tosca-met.html" title="">sang the title role in “Tosca</a>.”</p><p>Nézet-Séguin gave his baton to Larraín. Davidsen, one of the few <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/arts/music/forza-verdi-lise-davidsen-met-opera.html" title="">true opera stars</a> today, praised Jolie. “You actually sing!” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Jolie smiled and clasped her hands.</p><p>“You were just transcendent,” Jolie told Davidsen. “I don’t do what you do.”</p><p>On her way out, Jolie stopped to admire a portrait of Callas, who performed only 21 times at the Met, including a final run of “Tosca” with the company in 1965. She asked for a private moment.</p><p>“They really got her hands,” she said. “I love that.”</p><p>Then she made an impromptu visit to the stage.
