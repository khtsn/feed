Ukraine’s ability to fight effectively relies largely on that American intelligence.</p><p>“The Ukrainians don’t want this to be cut off no matter what,” said Camille Grand, a former NATO assistant secretary general. American intelligence is so sophisticated that it tells the Ukrainian military where Russian brigade headquarters are, where to target missiles and where to aim air defenses against incoming missiles, he said.</p><p>Despite Mr. Trump’s complaints about Ukraine, the United States has continued to provide intelligence to Kyiv, save for a pause for a few days after Mr. Trump took umbrage with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. It has also delivered weapons and equipment authorized by Congress during former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration. But that authorization, about $61 billion, is expected to run out in the next few months, and there is no talk in Washington of another appropriation of funds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>NATO defense ministers are expected to focus on spending goals and aid to Ukraine at meetings on Wednesday and Thursday in Brussels. Though Ukraine launched one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-strikes.html" title="">its most ambitious attacks yet</a> in Russia over the weekend and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crimea-bridge.html" title="">attacked</a> a key bridge on Tuesday, the issue is increasingly urgent as Ukrainian officials sound alarms about weapons shortfalls and Russia ramps up another offensive.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, in Albania last month.

Such purchases could help Ukraine maintain its capabilities in areas where U.S. weapons and systems outperform European versions.</p><p>Their expectations have been boosted by Mr. Trump’s overt frustration with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Putin has intensified the war, hit more civilian targets and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-offensive.html" title="">begun a summer offensive</a>, rather than agree to Mr. Trump’s desire for a cease-fire and an end to the bloodshed. Ukraine and Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-istanbul-talks.html" title="">met Monday</a> in Istanbul for peace talks that yielded little progress.</p><p>But the European members of NATO, who also represent the largest and most important members of the European Union, are largely united in their commitment to support Ukraine no matter what Washington decides to do.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Europeans regard a sovereign, independent Ukraine as a key element of their own security against a more aggressive, imperialist Russia, which demands a retreat of NATO forces to 1997 lines. That would create a larger gray zone of uncertainty and instability in Europe again, including all the countries of Central Europe.</p><p>NATO troops supporting national forces are stationed in the alliance countries that flank Russia, from the Baltics in the north to Bulgaria in the south, with eight forward-based multinational battalions and a ninth to come in Finland.</p><p>“The Europeans have made a basic strategic decision that Ukraine cannot be overrun, that they can’t let that happen,” said Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of War Studies, King’s College London.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers from Finland, Britain, the U.S., Germany, and other NATO nations participating in a maritime training drill off the coast of Norway in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Davide Monteleone for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Money is not the main issue, officials and analysts agree. Europe is already providing more money to Ukraine than the United States and can afford to give more. It has committed at least 23 billion euros for this year, roughly $26 billion, according to Kaja Kallas, the E.U. foreign and security chief. And there is more to be had from new defense loans and the leveraging or seizing of the €210 billion, or nearly $240 billion, of frozen Russian assets held in Europe.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The controversial mineral resources deal between the United States and Ukraine could also be used to offset direct American arms sales to Ukraine. American sales would be deducted from Ukraine’s share, which would allow Mr. Trump to insist that arms supplies are not a gift.</p><p>The war in Ukraine, which is now more than three years old, is also in some ways becoming cheaper to fight than when it began, as the two sides have moved to the use of sophisticated drones and artillery, rather than tanks and planes. The Europeans are now able to supply Ukraine with enough artillery shells, the analysts say, from their own increasing production and from purchases elsewhere. And European countries are investing more into the Ukrainian defense industry, which is proving “to be more efficient and adaptable than we are,” Mr. Freedman said.</p><p>Just last week, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/europe/zelensky-merz-berlin-visit.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">announced</a> a $5.7 billion arms package for Ukraine, including investment in missile production there. Ukraine is increasingly producing its own drones, missiles, vehicles, and artillery — fully 40 percent of its needs, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Monday.</p><p>But the time between investment and product delivery worries the Ukrainians as the American pipeline begins to dry up. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>What is hard to obtain are large numbers of air defense missiles, like the American Patriot. The Europeans have some Patriots, some of which they have already donated to Ukraine, mostly from German stocks, and European companies produce their own lesser versions, like the SAMP/T. But unlike the Patriot, it cannot shoot down fast-moving ballistic missiles.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>German and Ukrainian troops with Patriot missile batteries in Mecklenburg, Germany, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Jens Büttner</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>And there is no perfect replacement for the deep-strike capability and availability in volume of the HIMARS system, the U.S. mobile long-range missile, Mr. Grand said. The Europeans have airborne cruise missiles like the Storm Shadow and the Scalp, but in smaller numbers, and it is still not clear whether Germany will allow the export of its Taurus cruise missile. </p><p>Experts are optimistic that Ukraine will be able to hold off Russia’s summer offensive without significant losses. “The Russians always hope the next offensive will make a difference,” said Mr. Freedman. But even if the Russians gain ground, they lack enough experienced troops to hold it, he said.</p><p>“They still have no better idea than to throw people at the front lines,” he added.</p><p>If Ukraine beats back the Russian offensive, Russia will have largely exhausted its own weapons stocks and be reliant on new production, making it more vulnerable to international supply chains and foreign chips, said Jack Watling, a military expert at the defense think tank RUSI. And next year Russia will also face more domestic economic pressure, especially if oil prices remain low.</p><p>The Russian military has also performed relatively poorly in offensive operations, said Seth G. Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Russia has seized less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory since January 2024 and at great loss of life.</p><p>Last month, it lost about 1,000 casualties a day — dead, wounded or missing in action, said Mr. Grand. British defense intelligence judges that Russians will have suffered 1 million casualties, dead and wounded, by this summer. </p><p>Marc Santora<!-- --> and <!-- -->Maria Varenikova<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Steven Erlanger is the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe and is based in Berlin.
