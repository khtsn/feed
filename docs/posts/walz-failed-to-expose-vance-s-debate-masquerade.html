    <h1>Walz Failed to Expose Vance’s Debate Masquerade</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>JD Vance has always had the ability to switch on and off the outrageousness, to sound reasonable, to paper over a bitter and hollow core with a velvet patter learned at Yale and in countless television appearances. That was the version of himself that he presented to a national audience at the debate on Tuesday night, and it was a world away from how he sounds when campaigning in front of MAGA crowds.</p><p>If you saw only this performance, you wouldn’t know it was the same candidate who has viciously demonized Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio; who has railed against those American women who have chosen not to have children; who said as recently as Saturday that the mass deportation that he and Donald Trump have planned <a href="https://religionnews.com/2024/09/28/jd-vance-courage-tour/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is based on Christian principles</a>.</p><p>His long experience in tailoring his answers for his audience made him seem, at a superficial level, more polished than Tim Walz, who didn’t have the commanding performance his supporters had hoped for. The sly Midwestern charm that has been so effective in his speeches and campaign ads was missing, replaced by a nervous intensity that led to puzzling answers and missed opportunities to remind viewers of Trump’s unfitness for office.</p><p>When Vance provided a non sequitur rather than an answer on climate change, for example — “The best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people” — Walz could have taken a layup, explained that climate change really is about carbon emissions and reminded listeners of Trump’s multiple phony promises to save or build American factories. And he could have made clear that the Biden administration really has made an enormous investment in green energy and has saved far more manufacturing jobs than the Trump administration could have imagined doing.</p></div></div>
