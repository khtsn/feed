Nearly everyone is a renter and works at SpaceX, according to the petition.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The municipality would be eligible to create its own police and fire departments, as well as to adopt its own ordinances, though it does not have to.</p><p>“Cities are required by law to do very little,” said Alan Bojorquez, a lawyer in Austin who specializes in helping Texans through the process of incorporating new municipalities.</p><p>Road maintenance is one of the most significant practical issues and would no longer be handled by the county. But, as a municipality, Starbase would be eligible for state and federal grants, would have certain immunity from lawsuits and could also condemn property, Mr. Bojorquez said.</p><p>“Starbase started with one shovel,” Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1918851412592611831" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X shortly after the vote was finalized.</p><p>J.
