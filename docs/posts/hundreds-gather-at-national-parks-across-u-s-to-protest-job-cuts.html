By the afternoon, there were protests at at least 145 sites, according to Nick Graver, a 30-year-old graduate student who helped organize the demonstration at Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California.</p><p>Protests were held in popular spots like Yosemite in Northern California, Acadia in Maine, Yellowstone in the Northwest, the Gateway Arch in St. Louis and Great Falls Park in Virginia, as well as lesser-known places like Effigy Mounds National Monument in northeastern Iowa. Tensions have been particularly high at Yosemite, where employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/yosemite-job-cuts-trump.html" title="">unfurled an upside-down American flag</a> in protest across the face of El Capitan, a granite monolith.</p><p>Mr. Graver said his group was concerned not only about the firings but also about resource extraction on public lands and possible threats to national monuments, such as a proposal to remove the president’s power to designate national monuments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The National Park Service said it was working with protest organizers to allow people to “safely exercise their First Amendment rights,” while protecting its resources.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joshua Tree National Park in Twentynine Palms, Calif., last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bridget Bennett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At Joshua Tree, about 150 demonstrators gathered along a road leading to a park entrance. Six rangers at the park were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/15/us/politics/national-park-service-firings.html" title="">among those dismissed last month</a>, part of a wave of cuts targeting federal employees who had started work within the last year.</p><p>Deborah Anderson, who lived in the area for decades, protested with a sign that said “Protect Our Parks.”</p><p>“What’s happening right now is wrong,” said Ms. Anderson, 52. “I get if people want to make the government more efficient, but how they’re doing it — these are illegal firings.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Halfway across the country, at Effigy Mounds, about 150 people gathered, some with signs depicting the Lorax, the Dr. Seuss character who “speaks for the trees,” and Smokey Bear, the icon of the U.S. Forest Service’s wildfire prevention efforts. Among the demonstrators was Brian Gibbs, 41, who was fired from his job as education technician at the monument.</p><p>For Mr. Gibbs, the forested landscape along the Mississippi River that is home to the monument holds a lot of sentimental value. He said his father took him camping there when he was a child. Later in life, Mr. Gibbs told his wife he loved her for the first time in the area. And this is where they took their 4-year-old son on his first hiking trip.</p><p>So Mr. Gibbs was thrilled to get a job at the monument last year, he said, leading guided hikes, visiting school classrooms and designing programs like a winter bird walk. He was working on developing a guided snowshoe tour of a section of the park with a dense collection of Native American mounds when he was fired on Feb. 14.</p><p>After all of his experiences at the monument, Mr. Gibbs said, it was striking to see it become a protest site.</p><p>“It was just a volcanic moment to me,” Mr. Gibbs said. Regarding the parks, he added that “it never crossed my mind that they would become a target” of a presidential administration.</p><p>Mimi Dwyer<!-- --> contributed reporting from Yosemite National Park and Los Angeles, and Jennifer Brown from the Gateway Arch in St. Louis.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Hero Runaway Dog:</strong> For months, Scrim ran wild around New Orleans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/us/runaway-dog-scrim-new-orleans-hero.html">eluding capture and developing a giant fan base</a>.
