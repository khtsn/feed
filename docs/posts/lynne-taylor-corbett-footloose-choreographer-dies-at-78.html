She was 78.</p><p>The cause of death, at a hospital, was breast cancer, which she had survived for 38 years, her son, Shaun Taylor-Corbett, said.</p><p>Ms. Taylor-Corbett, who was raised in Denver, moved to New York at 17 to attend the School of American Ballet. Her dreams of establishing a career en pointe did not last long.</p><p>“I was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/22/archives/long-island-weekly-making-big-leaps-in-the-dance-field.html" title="">never really suited</a> to be a ballet dancer,” she said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. “But I had a gift for theatricality and movement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She also had a gift for connecting with audiences, as demonstrated by her work on exuberant Broadway musicals like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/29/theater/review-theater-in-trevor-nunn-s-musical-chess-east-faces-west-across-a-board.html#:~:text=The%20show%20is%20a%20suite,%2C%20like%20stock%2Dcar%20racing." title="">“Chess”</a> (1988) and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/24/theater/titanic-the-musical-is-finally-launched-and-the-news-is-it-s-still-afloat.html" title="">“Titanic”</a> (1997), Hollywood movies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/14/movies/film-review-plastic-surgery-takes-a-science-fiction-twist.html" title="">“Vanilla Sky”</a> (2001) and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/movies/trying-to-update-the-60s-just-a-twitch-at-a-time.html" title="">“Bewitched”</a> (2005), and entertainment-minded ballets like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/arts/dance/new-york-city-ballet-dances-the-seven-deadly-sins-review.html" title="">“Seven Deadly Sins”</a> (2011), a New York City Ballet production of a 1933 work by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill that she directed and choreographed; it had originally been choreographed by George Balanchine.</p><p>“My goal as a dancer and choreographer is to be understood,” she told The Times. “Dance should not be a cerebral experience that the dancers have and the audiences watch. I want dancers to communicate something and have the audience receive the same thing.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
