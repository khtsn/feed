    <h1>Arizona and Missouri Will Vote on Abortion in November</h1>

The ballot measure is a major victory for Democrats, who have used the issue of abortion to energize their voters.</p><p>In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion rights groups have prevailed in all seven states that have put the issue of how to regulate the practice directly to voters. Now, Democrats are hoping to carry that momentum into a battleground state that is critical to the presidential election as well as the control of the Senate.</p><p>“Poll numbers for abortion rights are higher than poll numbers for Kamala Harris,” my colleague Kate Zernike, who covers abortion, told me. “In Arizona, Democrats think this ballot measure can really help them draw more voters.”</p><p>A similar question will appear on the ballot in Missouri, state officials there said today. But the stakes are very different, Kate said. Harris is unlikely to win the state even with the measure on the ballot, but the outcome would send a message about support for abortion access in red states. If voters pass the measure, Missouri would become the first state where voters overturned a near-total ban, radically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" title="">reshaping access for millions of residents</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinian children in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ramadan Abed/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-274872e5">Hamas said it would not participate in new truce talks</h2><p>Hamas will not take part in the new round of cease-fire talks set for Thursday, an official for the group said.
