The woman, who took the stand under the pseudonym Mia, spoke about eight grueling years working for Mr. Combs in an environment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-mia-sex-abuse.html" title="">characterized by sleep deprivation and violent outbursts</a>.</p><p>In the afternoon, President Trump commented on the trial, saying that although no one had asked about a potential pardon, he would be open to looking “at the facts” of the case.</p><p>The music mogul has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. His lawyers have acknowledged their client has a history of violence and a “bad temper,” but assert he is not a racketeer or sex trafficker.</p><p>Here are some takeaways from the day in court.</p><h2 id="link-7de6d7e0">Mia faced her former boss’s lawyers.</h2><p>Mia testified that Mr. Combs threatened her, threw objects at her and sexually assaulted her during her years working for him. Prosecutors have accused him of subjecting her to forced labor — including sexual activity — through violence and threats of serious harm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>During cross-examination, Brian Steel, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, sought to show the jury another side of Mia’s time working for the famous record producer. The defense displayed dozens of posts from her Instagram account, many of which showed her posing beside or celebrating Mr. Combs, whom she called a “mentor” and an “inspiration,” as well as marveling at her good fortune to be working for him — years after she says he first sexually assaulted her.</p><p>“Why would you promote the person who has stolen your happiness in life?” Mr. Steel asked.</p><p>“Those are the only people I was around, so that was my life,” Mia replied, describing her time working for Mr. Combs as a “confusing cycle of ups and downs.”</p><p>Mr. Combs has vehemently denied sexually assaulting anyone. On cross-examination, Mr. Steel challenged the veracity of her accounts of an unwanted kiss, forced oral sex and a sexual assault while she was in his Los Angeles home.</p><p>“Isn’t it true that Mr. Combs never had unwanted, nonconsensual forcible sexual contact with you,” Mr. Steel asked her. “Isn’t that true?”</p><p>“What I said in this courtroom is the truth,” Mia replied.</p><h2 id="link-c72ff73">President Trump was asked about a potential pardon.</h2><p>During a news conference that served as a farewell for Elon Musk from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump was asked if he would consider pardoning Mr. Combs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Nobody’s asked,” Mr. Trump replied. “But I know people are thinking about it. I know they’re thinking about it. I think some people have been very close to asking.”</p><p>Noting that he hadn’t been watching the case closely, Mr. Trump said, “I would certainly look at the facts.”</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Combs overlapped at times in the ritzy, party-loving social circles of the New York City elite in the 1990s, with the two men acknowledging <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/255777-p-diddy-joins-rapper-fans-of-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mutual admiration</a> for the other over the years.</p><p>Mr. Trump was the first major celebrity attendee to arrive at Mr. Combs’s birthday party in 1998, and their public alliance became the subject of a Vibe magazine <a href="https://www.nancyjosales.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DonaldTrump2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a>. At the time, Mr. Combs was an ascendant hip-hop executive and Mr. Trump was a famed real estate mogul.</p><p>The next year, after Mr. Combs was charged in the attack of a rival music executive, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/98705697/?match=1&amp;terms=%22sean%20combs%22%20AND%20%22steve%20stoute%22%20AND%20%22arrested%22" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The New York Daily News</a>, “Puffy is a visionary and a great talent, and I hope and I know this will not be an obstacle.”</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Trump said he hadn’t spoken to Mr. Combs in years, adding that he thought “that relationship busted up, from what I read” after he got into politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“If I think somebody was mistreated,” he said, “whether they like me or don’t like me, it wouldn’t have any impact on me.”</p><h2 id="link-11529f5e">Mia detailed demands and threats.</h2><p>As a part of Mr. Combs’s entourage from 2009 to 2017, Mia — who referred to Mr. Combs by the nickname “Puff” on the stand — described her job as all-consuming, and said she had to “beg” to be allowed to attend her grandmother’s funeral. When Mr. Combs did not think she was performing her duties quickly enough, he could become violent, she said. Once, on a yacht in the Caribbean, she testified, he asked her to count the cash in a safe, then grew irate when he deemed her counting too slow.</p><p>“He chased me out and cursed at me and told me, ‘You better learn to walk on water like Jesus, bitch,’” Mia said on Friday.</p><p>Mia is also an important witness to prosecutors because she became a close confidante to Casandra Ventura, the music mogul’s on-and-off girlfriend of 11 years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial-cassie" title="">whose recounting of brutal violence, meticulous control and coerced sexual encounters</a> with male prostitutes, known as “freak-offs,” are at the heart of the government’s case.</p><p>Prosecutors focused in on a dispute between Mr. Combs and Mia that arose in 2015, when Mia was in South Africa with Ms. Ventura, known as the singer Cassie.</p><p>Around that time, Mia testified, Ms. Ventura had found evidence that Mr. Combs was seeing another woman, and she cut off contact with him. Mia said she received a barrage of calls and messages from Mr. Combs and one of his associates, who were trying to convince Ms. Ventura to call Mr. Combs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“He was threatening my job and then he threatened to kill me,” Mia said of Mr. Combs.</p><h2 id="link-7d92a888">Mia detailed the end of her employment.</h2><p>After years as a personal assistant for Mr. Combs, Mia testified that she was promoted to work on film and television projects, though she continued to carry out her old duties as well. In 2016, she said, her working relationship with Mr. Combs deteriorated after she was told that he wanted to shutter Revolt Films, the division of his company in which she was employed.</p><p>Seeking to undercut Mia’s testimony that she felt trapped in the job, the defense pointed to devastated text messages after she was informed her job would end, in which she declared “my life is over.”</p><p>She hired a lawyer and disclosed during mediation discussions that there had been instances in which Mr. Combs was violent with her, she testified; she said she ultimately received a settlement of around $400,000, almost half of which, she said, went to her legal representation.</p><p>As Mia testified about her challenges securing subsequent work because of the effects of what she called post-traumatic stress disorder, Mr. Combs, wearing a light-blue sweater and a collared shirt, leaned back with an incredulous expression.</p><p>After Ms. Ventura filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">bombshell lawsuit against Mr. Combs</a> in November 2023, accusing him of years of physical and sexual abuse, Mia received text messages and calls from Mr. Combs and a member of his inner circle asking to speak with her. She responded enthusiastically via text to his associate, with whom she said she had a good relationship. But she did not respond when Mr. Combs texted her in February 2024 asking for help getting his “memory jogged on some things.”</p><p>“I just didn’t want anything to do with him at all,” Mia testified.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
