Prosecutors have accused him of subjecting Mia to forced labor — including sexual activity — through violence and threats of serious harm.</p><p>During cross-examination, Brian Steel, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, sought to show the jury another side of Mia’s time working for the famous record producer. The defense displayed dozens of posts from her Instagram account, many of which showed her posing beside or celebrating Mr. Combs, a person she called her “mentor” and “inspiration,” as well as marveling at her good fortune to be working for him — years after she says he first sexually assaulted her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Why would you promote the person who has stolen your happiness in life?” Mr. Steel asked her.</p><p>“Those are the only people I was around, so that was my life,” Mia replied, describing her time working for Mr. Combs as a “confusing cycle of ups and downs.”</p><p>Mr. Combs has vehemently denied sexually assaulting anyone. His lawyer, Mr. Steel, confronted Mia with repeated questions about how she could have remained a close associate of Mr. Combs — writing to and about him with gushing admiration at times — after she endured sexual abuse and violence at his hands.</p><p>“I was young and manipulated and just eager to survive,” she replied.</p><p>Lawyers for the music mogul, who has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, have acknowledged that their client has a history of violence and a “bad temper,” but they have asserted that he is not a racketeer or sex trafficker.</p><p>As Mia testified about the challenges securing subsequent work because of the effects of what she called post-traumatic stress disorder, Mr. Combs, wearing a light-blue sweater and a collared shirt, leaned back with an incredulous expression.</p><p>As a part of Mr. Combs’s entourage from 2009 to 2017, Mia — who called Mr. Combs by the nickname “Puff” on the stand — recalled becoming enmeshed in the life of a high-flying record executive, partying with him and accompanying him on luxury vacations, while also being subjected to explosive outbursts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>She described her job as all-consuming, and said she had to “beg” to attend her grandmother’s funeral. When Mr. Combs did not think she was performing her duties quickly enough, he could become violent, she said — one time he threw a bowl of spaghetti at her, she said, and another, a computer. (Both of them missed.) Once, on a yacht in the Caribbean, she testified, he asked her to count the cash in a safe, then grew irate when he deemed her counting too slow.</p><p>“He chased me out and cursed at me and told me, ‘You better learn to walk on water like Jesus, bitch,’” Mia said on Friday.</p><p>Mia is also an important witness to prosecutors because, during her employment, she became a close confidante to Casandra Ventura, the music mogul’s on-and-off girlfriend of 11 years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial-cassie" title="">whose recounting of brutal violence, meticulous control and marathon sexual encounters</a> with male prostitutes, known as “freak-offs,” are at the heart of the government’s case.</p><p>Prosecutors focused in on a dispute between Mr. Combs and Mia that arose in 2015, when Mia was in South Africa with Ms. Ventura, known as the singer Cassie.</p><p>Around that time, Mia testified, Ms. Ventura had found evidence that Mr. Combs was seeing another woman, and she cut off contact with him. Mia said she received a barrage of calls and messages from Mr. Combs and one of his associates, who were trying to convince Ms. Ventura to call Mr. Combs.</p><p>“He was threatening my job and then he threatened to kill me,” Mia said of Mr. Combs.</p><p>Jurors saw a series of escalating messages from Mr. Combs to Mia in which he demanded that she call him and, if she didn’t, he wrote, “Imma tell everything” — a threat that Mia said referenced the sexual assaults, which she said Ms. Ventura was unaware of.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Let’s go to war,” Mr. Combs wrote to Mia.</p><p>On Thursday, Mia described an unwanted kiss from Mr. Combs soon after she started working for him, testifying that she had hoped it was an “accident” that would never happen again. She wept at times on the stand as she described two sexual assaults that followed, including forced oral sex in his bedroom closet and an incident in which she said she woke up in his Los Angeles home to find him on top of her. She testified that she “froze” and did not react as he penetrated her.</p><p>Mia testified that she did not report the assaults or tell anyone about them because she feared retaliation from Mr. Combs. She acknowledged that when she started cooperating with the government during its criminal investigation, she did not initially disclose the allegations of sexual assault.</p><p>On cross-examination, the defense challenged the veracity of her account.</p><p>“Isn’t it true that Mr. Combs never had unwanted, nonconsensual forcible sexual contact with you,” Mr. Steel asked her. “Isn’t that true?”</p><p>“What I said in this courtroom is the truth,” Mia replied.</p><p>After spending years as a personal assistant for Mr. Combs, Mia testified that she was promoted to work on film and television projects, though she continued to carry out the duties of an assistant as well. In 2016, she said, her working relationship with Mr. Combs deteriorated after she was told that he wanted to shutter the film division of his entertainment company, Revolt, in which she was employed.</p><p>Seeking to undercut Mia’s testimony that she felt trapped in the job, the defense pointed to devastated text messages after she was informed that her employment would be ending, in which she declared “my life is over.”</p><p>She hired a lawyer and disclosed during mediation discussions that there had been instances in which Mr. Combs was violent with her, she testified; she said she ultimately received a settlement of around $400,000, about half of which she said went to her lawyers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After Ms. Ventura filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-rape-lawsuit.html" title="">bombshell lawsuit against Mr. Combs</a> in November 2023, accusing him of years of physical and sexual abuse, Mia received text messages and calls from Mr. Combs and a member of his inner circle asking to speak with her. She responded enthusiastically via text to his associate, with whom she said she had a good relationship. But she did not respond when Mr. Combs texted her in February 2024 asking for help getting his “memory jogged on some things.”</p><p>“I just didn’t want anything to do with him at all,” Mia testified.</p><p>Ben Sisario<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
