The overhaul comes during a fraught period for the venue, including the deaths of two patrons found nearby last year.</p><p>Josh Wyatt, who was hired to lead Avant Gardner in October, announced the plans to renovate the East Williamsburg nightclub campus, which houses the Brooklyn Mirage, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDfFxH1PeQn/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a letter</a> this week. The changes are estimated to cost at least $10 million.</p><p>“The days of being a bootstrapping, entrepreneurial, sort of underground, roving rave party — those days are over,” Mr. Wyatt said in an interview.</p><p>New lighting, cellphone towers and signage will be installed to help patrons navigate the industrial neighborhood, Mr. Wyatt said. The club will also increase the number of guest ambassadors, who are trained to use the drug overdose reversal medication Narcan and spot attendees in trouble, from a dozen to up to 24 and increase the number of private patrol vehicles. Avant Gardner will also work with ride-sharing companies on better-marked pickup and drop-off points.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The sprawling venue is part of an industrial neighborhood that can be poorly lit, has spotty cell service and is dotted with construction sites. The changes come as Avant Gardner has sought to repair relations with patrons. In recent years, there have been complaints over crowd control, a lawsuit over a failed music festival and the two deaths that chilled the nightlife scene.</p><p>Mr. Wyatt said that permits for the new cellphone towers were approved this week and that the city had installed new maps around the venue to help guests navigate the area, with plans for more. He said the venue had spent $30,000 cleaning up an area outside the venue that is popular with food trucks to make it easier to see its entrance.</p><p>Mr. Wyatt called the new measures a “significant transformation of the overall experience.”</p><p>“These measures will enhance safety and improve the experience for attendees while also supporting the well-being of the thousands of workers and residents in the surrounding area,” said Jennifer Gutiérrez, a City Council member representing the area, adding, “I am looking forward to the commitments Mirage is making to be a responsible neighbor.”</p><p>On social media, where revelers had for months criticized the club’s response to the deaths in the area, the reaction to the letter was mixed. Some commenters on the venue’s Instagram page voiced skepticism that the new plans would make a difference. Some asked the venue’s security to stop confiscating Narcan from visitors; others complained of overcrowding. But there were also some notes of optimism that the club could turn around its reputation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The renovation will include a revamped sound system for the Mirage and new spaces designed for better crowd flow and more room to dance, addressing a chief complaint among regulars, Mr. Wyatt said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The outdoor stage at the Brooklyn Mirage has been under construction.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nate Palmer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Many of the changes are expected to be made before the 2025 concert season, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDXMbSlOozU/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which begins in earnest in May</a>, Mr. Wyatt said. The club, which is Brooklyn’s second-largest venue after Barclays Center, has been a hot spot for D.J. sets and concerts since it opened in 2016.</p><p>Mr. Wyatt, a former chief executive of the photography museum Fotografiska and the exclusive club NeueHouse, joined Avant Gardner in October after the venue faced several challenges, including a conflict with residents over its liquor license, lawsuits filed by people who had purchased tickets to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2023/10/10/lawsuits-pile-up-after-nycs-electric-zoo-music-festival-ends-in-overcrowding-and-canceled-acts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a botched electronic music festival</a> and disputes with local industrial businesses over traffic flow.</p><p>It has received renewed criticism over the last year as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/brooklyn-deaths-avant-gardner-newtown-creek.html" title="">rumors have circulated on social media about a serial killer in East Williamsburg</a> after three men who left two venues, including the Brooklyn Mirage, were found dead. One man was turned away by security at the Mirage because he was intoxicated, and a second left the venue during a show because he did not feel well. A third died after attending a show at the nearby Knockdown Center. The bodies of all three men were found in a nearby creek.</p><p>There was no evidence of foul play in the cases of the first two men, the police said, and their deaths last year were ruled drownings. The cause of death for the third man, who died this summer, was found to be undetermined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When The New York Times published a story in October about the nightlife community’s response to their deaths, Mr. Wyatt said it was an “emotional day” for staff members, who “have tried to really fight through a lot of different challenges.”</p><p>Mr. Wyatt acknowledged the venue’s “lack of proactive thought and consideration around how the neighborhood functions,” but he defended its security protocols. He said that the venue employed 65 security guards, many of whom are former police officers, and that turning away inebriated patrons at the door was standard procedure.</p><p>“I do think that this company has never had a moral failure in terms of providing experiences and safety levels for its guests,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Wyatt added that the lack of railings around the creek was a City Council issue.</p><p>Ms. Gutiérrez, the council member, said she had worked with state and federal officials to enhance safety around the creek, including improved lighting and fencing. She said she was working to have the waterway cleaned up.</p><p>For patrons hesitant to return, Mr. Wyatt said he and Avant Gardner were “focused on creating a world-class fan and hospitality experience.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
