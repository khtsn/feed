During fiscal 2023, it had an annual budget of $2.2 million, according to a filing with the Internal Revenue Service; Morgan was paid a salary of $95,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Friday at 5 p.m., the company issued a news release saying that Morgan had “resigned from his duties, effective immediately.” Jim Kierstead, the board’s president, raised the diversity issue in his statement in the news release, saying, “We will soon be announcing plans for a future filled with diversity, talent, and musical theater in order to continue our long legacy of supporting artists of all backgrounds.”</p><p>It quickly became clear that Morgan’s departure had been preceded by the resignation of Gerry McIntyre, the theater’s associate artistic director. In a resignation letter circulated to board members and posted on Facebook, McIntyre said he had raised concerns about a lack of audience diversity during a video meeting, and that Morgan “started to yell at me.” About one of the theater’s recent shows, he quoted Morgan as saying: “I want you to find anyone who would like this except this audience.” McIntyre said, “His comment immediately struck me as racist.” He added, “The tirade and venom was horrible.”</p><p>Neither McIntyre nor Morgan immediately responded to requests for comment, but in his letter, Morgan said: “There’s no question I was being defensive. I’ve tried to make diversity a consideration in everything we do — our programming, our outreach, our hiring, our everything. Were we late coming to the table? Yes. Could we — should we — have been doing more? Always. So, I am heartsick that the words that came out of my mouth reflected the exact opposite of how I feel.”</p><p>He added, “I’ve also learned that my aphasia, an after-effect of the stroke, has caused hurt and misunderstandings among the staff. I should have realized that sooner. Whether because of ego or stubbornness — or maybe just cluelessness — I didn’t. And I apologize.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
