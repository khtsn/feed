The bill, which was designed to enact the president’s agenda, has already passed the House. But some Senate Republicans have vowed to oppose any legislation that, in their view, would lead to excessive government borrowing.</p><p>Trump said that his critics were misguided and insufficiently loyal. His allies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-budget-bill-republicans-tax-cuts.html" title="">sought to undermine the budget experts</a> whose job it is to analyze the effects of legislation. The White House has argued that the tax cuts would lead to major economic growth, thus paying for themselves. The Joint Committee on Taxation, another nonpartisan office, disagrees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2b5bd178">Trump said that Putin would retaliate against Ukraine</h2><p>Trump said that Vladimir Putin told him during a phone call today that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-putin-ukraine.html" title="">planned to retaliate against Ukraine for its major drone attack</a>. Trump described the call on Russia’s war in Ukraine as “a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace.” He did not say whether he had tried to dissuade Putin.</p><p>During a meeting in Russia today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/world/europe/putin-zelensky-accusations-escalation.html" title="">Putin lashed out at Ukrainian leaders</a>.
