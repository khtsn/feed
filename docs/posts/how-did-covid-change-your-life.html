    <h1>How Did Covid Change Your Life?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the five-year anniversary approaches of the World Health Organization’s declaration of the coronavirus pandemic, The New York Times is interested in exploring the extent to which life has changed. (We also want to hear from you if <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/covid-deaths-grief.html" title="">you have lost someone to Covid or another cause of death</a> in the last five years.)</p><p>Have your daily routines changed? Do you make different decisions regarding your relationships? Has Covid changed your overall outlook, or did it for an extended period of time? Do you think of your life as having a prepandemic dividing line? When did your life start to feel “post”-pandemic — if it ever has — and why?</p><p>We may reach out to hear more about your submission, but we will not publish any part of your response without contacting you first, and we will never publicly share your personal information.</p></div></div>
