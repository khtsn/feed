In 2020, Mr. Biden won Georgia by less than a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html" title="">percentage point</a>, and the state is one of the more competitive election battlegrounds this year.</p><p>The interview comes as Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz take a bus tour through the state.</p><h2 id="link-4de0eb01">Who is conducting the interview?</h2><p>Dana Bash, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/dana-bash-presidential-debate-moderator.html" title="">experienced news anchor</a> with a long history of questioning presidential candidates, will conduct the interview.</p><p>Ms. Bash, 53, has already played a prominent role in the election: She co-hosted the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate#the-group-that-was-cut-out-of-hosting-this-years-debates-will-be-watching" title="">June 27 debate</a> between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden’s halting debate performance alarmed Democrats and ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race less than four weeks later. (Ms. Harris’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/media/kamala-harris-press-interviews.html" title="">last TV interview</a> came almost immediately after the debate, when she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMBmrW6LzV0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took questions</a> from Anderson Cooper on CNN.)</p></div></div>
