She added that the violence was being perpetrated by “armed men” belonging to all parties in the conflict.</p><p>The aid group Save the Children reported similar trends of children being victimized across eastern Congo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Rebels, said to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/africa/rwanda-congo-goma-conflict.html" title="">backed by Rwanda</a>, have been seizing huge tracts of the Democratic Republic of Congo at lightning speed. In a month, they have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/africa/congo-m23-rwanda.html" title="">routed Congo’s underequipped army</a> several times and caused more than half a million people to flee. In late January, the rebels <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/africa/congo-m23-rwanda-goma-burials.html" title="">captured Goma</a>, a Congolese city of three million people along the Rwandan border.</p><p>Rwanda’s president has given various answers to questions about whether his country is arming the rebels or if his troops are in Congo. He has often denied it, sometimes appeared to acknowledge it, and recently said that he did not know whether his country’s troops were there.</p><p>The rebels, known as M23, say they are protecting ethnic Tutsis, the minority group massacred in a 1994 genocide, some of whom also live in Congo. Experts, however, say the group is after Congo’s rare minerals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Captured soldiers of the Democratic Republic of Congo aboard vehicles outside the city of Goma last month as armed rebel soldiers walk by.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Guerchom Ndebo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“In North and South Kivu provinces, we are receiving horrific reports of grave violations against children by parties to the conflict, including rape and other forms of sexual violence at levels surpassing anything we have seen in recent years,” UNICEF’s executive director, Catherine Russell, said in a <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/children-eastern-democratic-republic-congo-increasingly-exposed-sexual-violence" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>She added that medical workers were running out of drugs used to reduce the risk of HIV infection after an assault.</p><p>President Trump’s pause on aid, and the gutting of the U.S. government’s primary foreign assistance agency, U.S.A.I.D., has left the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/health/trump-usaid-health-aid.html" title="">health of millions of people</a> around the world at risk.</p><p>Save the Children said it had evidence that 18 girls were sexually violated in South Kivu Province, and that a 16-year-old girl was killed resisting armed men.</p><p>“One mother recounted to our staff how her six daughters, the youngest just 12 years old, were systematically raped by armed men while searching for food,” she said.</p><p>The rebel group’s leaders have vowed to bring order and security to the areas it controls.</p><p>Elian Peltier<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ruth Maclean<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
