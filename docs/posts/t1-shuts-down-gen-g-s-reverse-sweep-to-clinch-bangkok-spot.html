<p>The stakes were clear entering Saturday&#39;s match: The loser would go home, and the winner would advance to the grand final and earn a spot at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>.</p>

<p>The match between two of Korea&#39;s strongest squads also saw familiar faces duel for the first time since parting ways. <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span>, who was a key piece in Gen.G&#39;s trophy-laden 2024, went against his old teammates for the first time, while <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11600/foxy9">

</span> also went against former DRX teammates <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/485/stax">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> for the first time.</p>

<p>The best-of-five series needed all five maps, with T1&#39;s Pearl, Gen.G&#39;s Lotus, T1&#39;s Haven, Gen.G&#39;s Split, and the decider map of Bind.</p>

<p>T1 began Pearl sprinting. While Gen.G had a more traditional team comp centered around KAY/O and Jett, T1 had a more eye-catching double Duelist comp that fielded Yoru and Neon. They used a quick start to get up 6-1, and while a Gen.G timeout would eat into their momentum, T1 never truly looked tested. They rode an 8-4 halftime advantage into the second half, picking up four rounds from the pistol and bonus rounds to close things out 13-8.</p>


<p><em>Meteor closing the book on Pearl. You couldn&#39;t write it any better.</em></p>

</span> since their upper final match against DRX, impressed again with a map-leading 18 kills on Pearl.</p>

<p>The series moved to Lotus, a staple of Gen.G&#39;s map pool on which they&#39;ve had great success since the beginning of the 2024 season. Gen.G&#39;s presumed dominance on the map seemed to continue entering halftime. On the three-site, attack-sided map, they managed six rounds on defense, and on attack looked to snowball that momentum into what would be one of many victories on the map.</p>

<p>However, T1 met Gen.G&#39;s attacking aggression with some of their own. After giving up the pistol and bonus rounds, T1 racked up seven straight rounds to steal away their opponents&#39; map pick, claiming a 2-0 lead and putting Gen.G on the brink of elimination.</p>

</span> last year. With Meteor again on Iso and BuZz on Yoru, T1 looked to seize the upper hand beginning on attack.</p>

<p>After grabbing the opening pistol round though, Gen.G managed a thrifty, throwing a wrench into T1&#39;s first-half economy. Gen.G stood strong on defense, with moments of heroics from in-game leader <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2489/munchkin">
		Munchkin	</a>
</span> inspiring them to a 7-5 halftime advantage.</p>

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34974/karon">

</span> enter a room of four and leave standing.</em></p>

<p>On attack, Gen.G did as T1 had on Lotus, winning six straight rounds to close out a near-perfect map and stealing T1&#39;s second map pick 13-5.</p>

<p>After shutting out their opponents on the first two maps and seizing all of the momentum, T1 was put on their heels. For Gen.G, the reverse sweep was on.</p>

<p>Gen.G had an unexpected team comp for their first Split game of the year. A double Initiator comp saw Munchkin on Tejo and <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/25081/yoman">
		yoman	</a>
</span> on Breach, while T1 again fielded two Duelists.</p>

<p>The map started with T1 clinching a thrifty following a Gen.G pistol round, which was the first step in a dominant 9-3 defending half. To open the second half, a reversal of roles saw Gen.G steal a thrifty after a T1 pistol, a testament to how strong both teams were on defense on the map.</p>

<p>Facing an 11-5 deficit, the Gen.G coaching pair of <span data-ref-id="13">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/21792/hsk">
		HSK	</a>
</span> called timeouts, breathing new life into their squad. That saw them win the next three rounds, closing to within three rounds and forcing T1 head coach <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2504/autumn">
		Autumn	</a>
</span> to call a timeout of his own.</p>


<p><em>Munchkin and yoman play high-low to hit the brakes on T1&#39;s A push.</em></p>

<p>Gen.G won five straight rounds to pull to within one round at 11-10, but a T1 full push onto A saw them reach match point. After going back to that strategy for another two rounds, Gen.G countered seamlessly, forcing overtime.</p>

<p>The map ended as it started, with a back-and-forth exchange of rounds eventually ending with Gen.G on top, 17-15. <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9196/t3xture">

</span>, who struggled to find his play like his usual self on the first three maps, returned to normal on Split, dropping a server-high 35 kills — including a <a href="https://x.com/vctpacific/status/1888196923146022954" target="_blank">map-ending ace</a>.</p>

<p>That led to the decider map of Bind, where both teams have had their fair share of ups and downs. T1 has beaten <span data-ref-id="17">

</span>. Gen.G has an overtime loss to DRX and a win over TALON.</p>

<p>With plenty of film on each other, T1 appeared better suited to the map, having the read on Gen.G&#39;s defense. An unrelenting head-on attack saw T1 storm forward, claiming the first nine rounds of the map, burning through both of Gen.G&#39;s regulation timeouts.</p>

<p>Still, a few moments of heroics gave Gen.G three rounds to end the half, switching sides down 9-3.</p>


<p><em>t3xture with a seemingly impossible ace to salvage a round for Gen.G.</em></p>

<p>With the exclusion of a would-be bonus round, Gen.G put their foot down on attack, winning five of the first six rounds to narrow the gap to 10-8. As opposed to T1&#39;s fast, direct attack, Gen.G opted for a more patient approach — the same approach that saw them struggle to attack on Split.</p>

<p>T1 would reach match point with four rounds of cushion. While Gen.G showed signs of another comeback, 10 was the most they managed. A BuZz vs. t3xture Operator duo and T1 winning their individual duels saw them finally wipe away Gen.G and reach the organization&#39;s first grand final ever.</p>


<p><em>The moment T1 qualified for Masters Bangkok and their <strong>first</strong> grand final.</em></p>

<p>T1 flex player <span data-ref-id="20">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29833/izu">

</span> had a team-high 83 kills at the end of five maps, while t3xture&#39;s 93 and <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34974/karon">
		Karon	</a>
</span>&#39;s 88 were not enough in the losing effort.</p>

<p>With the win, T1 will move up to the grand final to take on DRX, who they lost to in the upper final 2-1. It will be the first grand final appearance in team history for T1, while Gen.G will be sidelined until Pacific Stage 1 begins in March.</p>
