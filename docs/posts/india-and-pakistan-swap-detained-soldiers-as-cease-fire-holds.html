The Indian Border Security Force said that one of its soldiers had been returned after three weeks of detention. A Pakistani official said that an Indian border guard had been handed over in return for a member of the Pakistani Rangers, a paramilitary force, who had been in Indian custody for almost two weeks.</p><p>Each soldier had ventured into the other’s country inadvertently and had been detained in the days leading up to the military confrontation this past week, during which India struck targets inside Pakistan as retaliation for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/asia/kashmir-attack-india-pakistan.html" title="">terrorist attack</a> in April in the Indian part of Kashmir. India blames that attack, which killed 26 civilians, on Pakistan, though Pakistan has denied involvement.</p><p>The strikes quickly escalated to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-photos.html" title="">an intense, four-day military confrontation</a> between the neighboring countries, the like of which had not been seen in decades.

Commercial flights have resumed, and Kashmiris have started returning to homes damaged during the confrontation.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Suhasini Raj is a reporter based in New Delhi who has covered India for The Times since 2014.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
