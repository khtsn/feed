On his website, the Red Hand Files, Mr. Cave writes often astonishingly vulnerable responses to questions from readers about faith, love and — frequently — devastating, inconsolable loss. In a recent appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” Mr. Cave spent more time discussing the transformative power of devastation than the particulars of his new album. In recent years, a number of magazine pieces and podcast appearances have covered similar ground.</p><p>When asked if he found himself besieged in the grocery store these days by people who, rather than hounding him for an autograph, want to share their most painful moments, he said, “That does happen.”</p><p>But on this sunny Irish afternoon, the Dubliners encountered by Mr. Cave, with his swoop of black hair and decked out in one of his signature bespoke suits, were giddy in the usual way of fans who spot a rock star in the wild: smiling, waving, asking to take selfies with him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m here for a scarf!” Mr. Cave announced as we entered Cleo, the traditional Irish woolens shop raved about by the bassist Colin Greenwood, sometimes of Radiohead, but currently an adopted member of the band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, which Mr. Cave has led since 1983. The musicians were in the Irish capital for two sold-out shows at the 3Arena, at the end of a European leg of a tour that will bring them to America in April. Mr. Cave moved briskly through the shop to a section in the back, quickly selected a simple black scarf and went to pay, adding a stuffed animal for his first grandchild, born earlier this year.</p><p>Mr. Cave, who is 67, has fathered four sons: twins, Arthur and Earl, with his wife, the model and fashion designer Susie Cave, and Luke and Jethro from previous relationships. In 2015, Arthur, then 15 years old, died after falling from a cliff near the family home in Brighton, England. In 2022, Jethro also died (his cause of death was not disclosed). Mr. Cave started the Red Hand Files in part to process Arthur’s death. He has said that loss now defines him, that he sees grief as a universal language connecting all people and that walking through it has made him a bolder artist. “There’s an understanding that we are all creatures of loss,” he said. “That we’re all in the same boat, in some way, that what happened to me is not special.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Many bouquets of flowers rest against a wire fence on the edge of a cliff." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/multimedia/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct/NICK-CAVE-body-01-qvct-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/810cb1d9-ca31-5878-8e5d-f5ba297529b3" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Floral tributes are left at the spot where Mr. Cave’s 15-year-old son Arthur fell from a cliff in 2015.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tabatha Fireman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since Arthur’s death, the Bad Seeds have released two records: the haunted, swirling “Skeleton Tree” in 2016 and the delicate, unconscious-feeling “Ghosteen” three years later. Mr. Cave wrote both with Warren Ellis, who joined the band in the ’90s and is also Mr. Cave’s most constant and key creative collaborator. The songs were so “fragile” (a favorite word of Mr. Cave’s) that they left little room for the other members to add much.</p><p>With “Wild God,” the group’s 18th LP, released in August, that changed. The album, which has earned the Bad Seeds their first Grammy nominations, represents not so much a return to form as a renaissance; Mr. Cave’s music has always been obsessed with death, God, violence, sex, depravity and — from the very beginning of Mr. Cave’s career, when he fronted the post-punk band the Birthday Party — he retained a kind of feral, agitated joy. On “Wild God,”<em> </em>it’s as if every theme from every era of Mr. Cave’s wildly varied creative life has passed through the abject chaos, disruption and disorientation of these last years and come out on the other side bigger, sadder, sweeter, louder and more sacred than ever.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Watching Mr. Cave have a gentle conversation with the Irish shopkeeper selling him knitwear, or listening to him thoughtfully discuss his religious practice on the podcast “On Being,”<em> </em>or reading a particularly tender reply of his to a Red Hand Files reader, it’s easy to imagine that lost forever is the menacing drug-addicted urchin who used to antagonize his audience, his bandmates, and terrorize journalists as part of the project of making some of the most thrilling rock music in history. But that would be a mistake.</p><p>As we left the shop and headed back toward his hotel, one of the selfie seekers from earlier was still hanging around, waiting for the artist. The fan approached, saying that his eyes were closed in the first photo they took, and that he’s so sorry to bother, but would the singer mind taking another picture? Mr. Cave took the phone, extended a long arm in front of them both to get the shot, but furrowed his signature brows. After the fan was out of earshot, Mr. Cave smirked. “That was worse than someone coming up and saying ‘My wife just died.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many fans of Mr. Cave attend his shows for the transcendent performances that border on sermons.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hannes Draxler/Agence France-Presse, via Fotokerschi.at, via Getty Ima</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-758f5aff">A Private Life</h2><p>At some point about a decade ago, Mr. Cave basically stopped doing music press. Talking about his creative work started to feel, like a rote enterprise — yakking to people you don’t know about a thing you made that can only really be degraded by trying to describe it.</p><p>In 2018, he went on a solo “Conversations With Nick Cave” tour in which he played a handful of songs on the piano and took questions from the audience. That same year, he debuted the Red Hand Files, which he thinks of as a “journey toward the better end of my personality” because he is not naturally empathetic. “My reaction is usually more like, get a grip,” he said. And in 2022 he published the book “Faith, Hope and Carnage,” a series of conversations with the Irish journalist Sean O’Hagan that delve deeply into Mr. Cave’s religious life, among other weighty subjects. Mr. Cave remembers first connecting with Mr. O’Hagan backstage at a show with their mutual friend, the Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie; Mr. O’Hagan and Mr. Gillespie “ganged up” on Mr. Cave over his unwillingness to boycott Israel. They argued for three hours, “screaming at each other,” he recalled, and Mr. Cave woke up the next morning thinking “I really enjoyed that!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Since it began running in 2018, the Red Hand Files has received over 100,000 submissions. “It’s everything from ‘Why are you such a wanker?’ to people writing their whole life stories,” Mr. Cave said. The artist’s assistant helps lightly edit his responses, but other than that the entire process of sifting through the letters and choosing which ones to respond to rests with Mr. Cave. “Here, I’ll show you,” he said, standing up and striding across the suite to the bedroom to grab his laptop. “There are a hundred-something a day, now,” he said as he scrolled through the most recent letters, noting one he had highlighted that asked about how to find meaning in the meaningless, which he was considering tackling next. “Someone wants to know what I think of the new Cure album, which I actually like.” He paused. “Oh, and here’s a religious one.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Cave on stage with the Irish journalist Sean O’Hagan in Denmark in 2022.

Growing up in Wangaratta, Victoria, Mr. Cave sang in his local church choir but his was not a religious household. His mother, a high school librarian, and his father, a literature teacher who read “Lolita” (among other serious literary works) to Mr. Cave as a boy, weren’t especially devout. From about as early as he can remember, Mr. Cave had what he calls “a weird attraction to Christ.” In particular, the Gospels drew him in. “I’d get an emotional resonance that I just didn’t find in other literature,” he said.</p><p>He indulged in the kind of run-of-the-mill juvenile delinquent behavior expected from a burgeoning rock star: He was expelled from school at 13 for wild and unruly behavior; he was sent to boarding school in Melbourne; and, after completing high school and enrolling in art college, he dropped out to focus on music. He had begun using heroin sometime in his late teens, an addiction that would consume him for the next 20 or so years.</p><p>In a moment that he has spoken about poignantly — and that imprinted an early if unconscious awareness of life’s potential for random acts of wrenching cruelty — Mr. Cave was 19 years old and sitting in a jail cell having been picked up for burglary when his mother arrived to bail him out and informed him his father had been killed in a car accident. A few years later, in 1980, Mr. Cave moved with the Birthday Party to London, where fame and fortune awaited. Personally, though, Mr. Cave was grappling with the kind of spiritual (though he is not fond of that word) inquiries and conflicted mix of reverence and doubt that most snot-nosed young rock boys who have just started getting girls do not trouble themselves with.</p><p>“I used to spend time, even in my wildest days, sitting in churches,” he recalled. “I would be alright for a while, and then the sermon would happen, and I would just start to feel embarrassed, but I’ve always loved churches. In my craziness of drug addiction I saw church as a moral force. I thought that if I could go to church, then I could go and score and I was leading a well-rounded existence, a balanced life.”</p><p>Mr. Cave has also been into Christian iconography since the early Birthday Party records. From the drama of “The Mercy Seat” (about an unrepentant inmate on death row) to the spare reverence of his direct pleas to God on “Into My Arms,” Mr. Cave’s fixation with religious motifs is longstanding. So it’s funny when people write in to the Red Hand Files enraged by “this religion stuff,” as Mr. Cave put it. “As if it hadn’t been there all along,” he said. “It’s like a wife suddenly being upset with her husband who’s been a serial philanderer — I’ve always been cheating with God.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nick Cave and The Birthday Party performing at The Venue, Victoria, London, UK on 26 November 1981.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Corio/Redferns, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For Mr. Cave, not much has changed between who he was then and now.</p><p>“Young Nick Cave was on the right track,” he said. “We felt a duty to upset people — I got an insane delight out of upsetting people; it was just so exciting. But I was never railing against the establishment or the status quo, I always intended to disrupt the culture that I was embedded in.”</p><p>His heroes were artists like Johnny Cash, Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan: “People that were, in my view, mostly a thorn in the side of the culture,” he said. Religion, and his willingness to discuss his relationship with God openly, is, Mr. Cave added, the primary area in which he currently feels that same sense of thrilling provocation that once fueled his desire to get onstage and scream things like ‘Release the bats, release the bats, release them!’”</p><p>“There’s a conversation developing around religion, which is volatile but is a conversation nevertheless, and that wasn’t there before, and I find it really interesting,” he said. “I find it interesting to defend something that’s indefensible.”</p><p>Still, he is amused but also somewhat saddened by fans who feel offended by his integration of religious devotion into the cool rock ’n’ roll stuff. They feel a sense of betrayal, as if in delving into these themes about loss and how it’s opened him up to God, Mr. Cave has robbed fans not just of a version of him that they feel attached to but of a version of themselves. “I get people writing in, probably of my age, saying what happened to you?” Mr. Cave said, “And my response would be what<span>  </span>didn’t happen to you?”</p><h2 id="link-5770c7b7">A Return to Joy</h2><p>The Bad Seeds have delivered the exact same two-and-half-hour set every night in arenas across Europe for over a month. No opening band. No lulls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>This European leg has so far earned praise from high places. “Saw Nick Cave in Paris recently at the Accor Arena and I was really struck by that song Joy where he sings “We’ve all had too much sorrow, now it the time for joy,” Mr. Dylan himself wrote in a post on social media. “I was thinking to myself, yeah that’s about right.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The most recent album has earned the Bad Seeds their first Grammy nomination.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Every night the band members eat together. Mr. Cave is mostly a vegetarian (a move he made years ago to support his son who was trying it out) but he has a sweet tooth. “That’s mine!” he growled, with mock anger as someone tried to take away the lingering last bite of a caramel-brownie concoction, before cracking up and then pretending to lick the bowl.</p><p>Onstage, Mr. Ellis and Mr. Cave orbit each other like yin-and-yang forces of nature: Mr. Cave the angular, sleek center of gravity, Mr. Ellis the chaotic mad scientist and wingman, playing the violin like he has been struck by lightning. But offstage their vibe is fraternal — like two brothers who grew up sharing a room, and have always and will always know all of each other’s deepest secrets.</p><p>The Irish writer Victoria Mary Clarke, a friend of Mr. Cave’s who is also the widow of another close friend, the singer-songwriter Shane MacGowan, came in after the show. (Mr. Cave performed a heart-stopping version of the Pogues’ “Fairytale of New York” at Mr. MacGowan’s funeral in 2023.) We discussed the assorted ways in which Mr. Cave is regularly groped onstage. “One of the worst things that can happen to you is a slap on the ass,” Mr. Cave asserted. “I’m fondled all the time, but when you’re slapped an immediate sense of rage shoots through you.”</p><p>Ms. Clarke said she was heading home to bed, but first Mr. Cave wanted to put her on the phone with his wife Susie. Earlier that evening, just after the show had finished, he discussed what is perhaps the purest experience of conversion in his life: the moment he met the woman to whom he has now been married for 25 years. “There was a giant dinosaur involved,” Mr. Cave said, referring to the fact that he first saw her standing under a full-size skeleton of Dippy the Diplodocus at the Natural History Museum in London, during a fashion show by the designer Bella Freud.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Mr. Cave was thunderstruck. “And then over the next year, I tried to work out how to ask a woman on a date — I never had to do that sort of thing before,” he added. “I was in a band!” It was as if Mr. Cave was learning, at 40, through that new love, how to be a human being. He was still “a terrible junkie” at the time and “not in showroom condition,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Model and fashion designer Susie Cave, Mr. Cave’s wife, who co-founded the fashion house The Vampire’s Wife, which recently shuttered.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren Fleishman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Her friends warned her off. Mr. Cave’s song “Final Rescue Attempt” is about the moment when, after leaving him, she returned, announced that she loved him and promised to stay, no matter what he did to himself. “I’m like, Wow, really? I can be a drug addict and get the girl?” Mr. Cave recalled. “And then after a couple of months, even I could see that wasn’t the right way to have a relationship. So I went to rehab and stopped taking drugs.” They were married in 1999 and found out she was pregnant with twins while on their honeymoon at a dude ranch in Arizona.</p><p>People were tearing up, and some were openly crying, at different moments during that evening’s performance, including as he sang “Final Rescue Attempt.” Which was the most emotionally intense moment for him? He mentioned the plaintive “I Need You,” with the wrenching lyrics “Nothing really matters when the one you love is gone,” off “Skeleton Tree.” “It can be quite difficult to get through that song,” Mr. Cave said. “Because it was just ad-libbed off the top of my head before anyone died, so it’s this strange thing that circles around a few different images and has now attached itself like a limpet to this series of disasters that seems to make up the last years in this really powerful way that I don’t quite understand.”</p><p>But equally powerful was a song that comes early in the set and is on its face the opposite of a tear-jerker: “From Her to Eternity.” Mr. Cave wrote the song in 1984 with his on-again-off-again girlfriend Anita Lane, an early member of the Bad Seeds. Here was a version of that same band playing a song written exactly 40 years ago, when everyone involved was very young, delivered without sentimentality or nostalgia, purely to generate this holy noise from a place of wisdom and hard-earned joy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There’s a conversation developing around religion, which is volatile but is a conversation nevertheless, and that wasn’t there before, and I find it really interesting,” Mr. Cave said. “I find it interesting to defend something that’s indefensible.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>ST</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Loss Helps Nick Cave Find His Way<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
