</span> reaffirming their spot at the top of the region while surprise results caught the attention of neutrals.</p>

<p>The results from the second weekend of matches were:</p>



<p>After dropping their opening match of league play against domestic rivals Cloud9, NRG Esports bounced back to capture their first win of Stage 1 against FURIA. It wasn&#39;t easy the whole way, though. The series began with the rebuilding Brazilian team stealing NRG&#39;s map pick of Lotus 13-10, threatening to pull off a big early upset. However, NRG dominated the next two maps in every facet, dropping just six rounds en route to a 2-1 victory. </p>

<p>While the first match teased a LATAM-over-NA upset, the second match of the weekend saw it happen. Inspired by clutch play after clutch play from the likes of <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/2462/keznit">
		keznit	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7603/mazino">

</span>, KRÜ Esports pulled through to topple Sentinels. Despite heroics from <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4004/zekken">

</span>, including an ace to be remembered on the first map, the Argentinian org led by a five-man squad of Chileans defeated the American giants to move to 2-0 in league play.</p>

<p>After dropping their opening match to Sentinels, 100 Thieves bounced back against Evil Geniuses, sweeping them 2-0 off the heels of a dominant performance from <span data-ref-id="17">

</span> on Vyse for all three maps. He and jawgemo had 58 and 64 kills in the series, respectively.</p>

<p>After suffering losses in their opening matches, LOUD and 2Game Esports both will have looked for a bounce-back win. While LOUD once reigned supreme over fellow Brazilian organizations, their fall from grace was on display Sunday. They fell 2-0 to a 2Game side that, in the week before the match, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/465700/2game-esports-parts-with-zap" target="_blank">parted ways with their IGL</a> following an internal conflict, and signed a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/466500/2game-esports-signs-pxs" target="_blank">tier 2 player</a> to round out their five-man roster. LOUD Duelist <span data-ref-id="20">

		dgzin	</a>
</span> was the only player in the server to eclipse the 50-kill mark, but his best efforts were not enough as LOUD suffered just their second-ever loss against a Brazilian org.</p>

<p>To wrap up the weekend, Cloud9 dominated LEVIATÁN in every facet, sweeping them 2-0. While the first map&#39;s 13-8 scoreline suggests a tighter contest, the American squad never looked uncomfortable. Up against <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/1129/rossy">
		Rossy	</a>
</span>, their IGL in the offseason, a reinvented Cloud9 shined thanks to a breakout performance from <span data-ref-id="22">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/17433/v1c">
		v1c	</a>
</span>. The rookie led the way for his squad, topping the server with 38 kills and notching an eye-popping 24/4/20 scoreline on the second map.</p>

<p>KRÜ sits alone at the top of Group Alpha, with five 1-1 teams separating them and a winless LOUD in the standings. Cloud9 and G2 remain as the only undefeated teams in Group Omega, with C9 holding a narrow advantage by round differential, while FURIA and LEVIATÁN continue to search for their first wins. </p>
