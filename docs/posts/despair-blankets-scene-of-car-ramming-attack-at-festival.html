It was a celebration of Filipino culture, and music from a live concert echoed through the streets as families lined up at food trucks and children played.</p><p>On Sunday it was strangely silent.</p><p>“It gives me chills,” said Franchesca Gabo, taking it all in.</p><p>Ms. Gabo, 20, left the festival shortly before a driver rammed his SUV into the mass of people, killing 11 and injuring more than 30.</p><p>Now, she had come back, joining an impromptu vigil of people peering over police tape and trying in vain to absorb the enormity of what had happened.</p><p>“It was a happy day yesterday,” Ms. Gabo said. “Everyone was celebrating.”</p><p>The authorities say the motive for the attack did not appear to be terrorism. But beyond that little had emerged about the suspect in custody other than that he is a 30-year-old man with a history of mental illness. Now, he is charged with murder.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>More was becoming known about the victims at the festival celebrating Lapu Lapu Day.</p><p>The youngest was Katie Le, a 5-year-old girl who was killed along with her parents, Richard Le, 47, and Linh Hoang, 30, according to local news reports. Mr. Le’s 16-year-old son, Andy, survived because of a last-minute decision to skip the festival in favor of homework, relatives said.</p><p>A school board in a nearby suburb said that a guidance counselor named Kira Salim was also among the dead. “The loss of our friend and colleague has left us all shocked and heartbroken,” it said in a statement.</p><p>And fund-raising began to help people wounded in the attack and repatriate the remains of at least one victim who was killed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Filipino flag near the scene.

In June 2023, a government report made note of Filipinos’ robust representation in the trades, health care, service and business administration sectors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Filipino Canadians are among the hardest working people in Canada,” the report said.</p><p>Many made it to Canada via foreign worker programs, including a live-in caregiver program that ran between 1992 and 2014 and <a href="https://torontolife.com/city/toronto-filipino-caregiver-nanny-diaries/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped resettle</a> about 75,000 Filipinos.</p><p>Angelo Cruz, who grew up in the neighborhood where the festival took place, said Monday that his mother, despite having a master’s degree in science, worked as a nanny until she could gain residency and help the rest of her family immigrate.</p><p>“You make that sacrifice, you let go of potentially raising your own child, because you want your child to have a better life,” Mr. Cruz said.</p><p>But Lapu Lapu Day is meant to be a break from all that.</p><p>“It was the one time we wanted to express ourselves and have fun — and we couldn’t even get that,” said Mr. Cruz, a human resources administrator who grew up in the community where the festival was held. “That was heartbreaking for me.”</p><p>The edge of the neighborhood was decorated with bunting in yellow, navy blue, white and red, the national colors of the Philippines, though the streets are lined by a mix of businesses and restaurants offering not just Filipino but also Vietnamese, Chinese and Indian food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Sunday, Mr. Cruz and his family stepped out of Pin Pin, a restaurant serving up his traditional favorites like pancit palabok, a garlic noodle and shrimp dish, and the Filipino spring rolls known as lumpia. Then they headed toward the vigil sites.</p><p>At one of them, Arturo Macapagal, an operating room nurse who is often in the neighborhood took a moment to say a quiet prayer, joined by a priest.</p><p>“Anytime you’re gathering, especially the Filipino community, it’s about food and happiness and joy and laughter and the camaraderie,” Mr. Macapagal said.</p><p>When Prime Minister Mark Carney came to pay his respects, the crowd erupted into “Amazing Grace.”</p><p>Amid the mourning, life went on.</p><p>Music blasted on the street from Proud Pinoy Grocery Store, a hub for specialty food products. Shoppers browsed shelves carrying dried fish called tuyo, heavy sacks of jasmine rice and sweet corn chips. A poster advertising the Lapu Lapu Day festival was still taped to door.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vjosa Isai is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Toronto, where she covers news from across Canada.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
