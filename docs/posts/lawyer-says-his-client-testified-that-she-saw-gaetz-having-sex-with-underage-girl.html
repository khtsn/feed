    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Leppard, speaking to ABC News, said one of the women testified that “in July of 2017, at this house party, she was walking out to the pool area, and she looked to her right, and she saw” Mr. Gaetz “having sex with her friend, who was 17.”</p><p>He told CNN that Mr. Gaetz later discovered the girl was underage.</p><p>Both women also told the committee that they were paid for sex using Venmo, Mr. Leppard said.</p><p>Mr. Gaetz has previously denied the allegations. </p><p>Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the Trump transition, said, “Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He’s the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.” </p><p>Mr. Gaetz is one of several controversial nominees whom Mr. Trump has announced he will submit for Senate confirmation.
