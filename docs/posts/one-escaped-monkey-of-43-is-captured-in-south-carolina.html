It was not clear where the one monkey was captured.</p><p>Some escapees are interacting through a fence with their companions who remain at the research center, the police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Facebook post, quoting Greg Westergaard, chief executive of Alpha Genesis, said that the “recovery process is slow, but the team is committed to taking as much time as necessary to safely recover all remaining animals.”</p><p>Alpha Genesis houses about 7,000 primates for biomedical studies and other scientific research.</p><p>The police warned the public not to get near the animals and not to get too close to the research center, which is on 100 acres and surrounded by woods where some of the monkeys have been spotted in trees.</p><p>The Facebook post also urged residents not to fly drones in the area.</p><p>“A recent incident involving a drone led to the primates becoming spooked, which not only increased their stress but also complicated efforts for their safe return,” the post said.</p><p>There is no risk to public health because the animals are too young to carry disease, according to Alpha Genesis.</p><p>Gregory Alexander, the town’s police chief, said that it’s unlikely that the monkeys would be aggressive toward humans, though they are skittish. Each weighs six to seven pounds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The research center is using humane traps and fresh fruit and vegetables to bait the monkeys, which is an effective lure because the domesticated animals cannot easily find food in the wild. A couple of the escapees entered the traps, but did not go in far enough to make the doors close, the police said.</p><p>The town’s 2,200 residents have been asked to keep their doors and windows closed, and to call the police if they spot a monkey.</p><p>This is not the first time the town has dealt with escaped monkeys from Alpha Genesis.</p><p>In 2014, 26 monkeys escaped and were recaptured <a href="https://www.saenonline.org/news-media-news-2018/Alpha-Genesis-$12600-Fine-7-24-17.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">within two days.</a> In 2017, the company was fined $12,600 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for that episode and other failures to contain the animals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sara Ruberg covers breaking news and is a member of the 2024-25 class of <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellows</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
