The people who received pardons were convicted of nonviolent crimes, including possession of marijuana.</p><p>The announcement came two weeks after Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/biden-pardon-son-hunter.html" title="">issued a pardon for his son</a>, Hunter, who had been convicted of gun possession and income tax evasion. That decision was harshly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats because Mr. Biden had long ruled out clemency for his son.</p><p>The White House said that the clemency announced on Thursday represented Mr. Biden’s commitment to “help reunite families, strengthen communities, and reintegrate individuals back into society.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Biden, the statement said, is the first president to issue categorical pardons to people convicted of simple use and possession of marijuana, as well as to former service members convicted of violating the military’s former laws against homosexual conduct.</p><p>For months, activists have been pushing Mr. Biden to use his clemency power for inmates who were moved to home confinement during the pandemic, when Covid was spreading rapidly through jails and prisons. Some Republicans, who are set to take control of Congress next month, have tried to push legislation that would have forced those people to return to prison.</p><p>In his statement on Thursday, Mr. Biden said that many of those people would have received lower sentences if they had been charged under current laws.</p><p>“These commutation recipients, who were placed on home confinement during the Covid pandemic, have successfully reintegrated into their families and communities and have shown that they deserve a second chance,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Biden said that he would take more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions.
