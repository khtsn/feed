The White House said it was the largest number of commutations by an American president in a single day.</p><p>The commutations affect those who had been released from prison and placed in home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic. The pardons are for people convicted of nonviolent crimes, including drug offenses.</p><p>“America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. He said the clemency represented his commitment to “help reunite families, strengthen communities and reintegrate individuals back into society.”</p><p>A pardon wipes out a conviction, while a commutation leaves the guilty verdict intact but reduces some or all of the punishment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Biden’s action was one of the biggest grants of clemency in modern American history. President Jimmy Carter, on his first day in office, issued a pardon that affected more people, for men who evaded the Vietnam War draft. But that was what is known as a categorical pardon; Mr. Biden’s commutations are for individual cases.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="president-clemency-chart" data-id="100000009874974" data-source-id="100000009874974"><div slug="president-clemency-chart" data-sourceid="100000009874974" id="embed-id-100000009874974">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The announcement came two weeks after Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/biden-pardon-son-hunter.html" title="">issued a pardon for his son Hunter</a>, who had been convicted of gun possession and pleaded guilty to income tax evasion. That decision was harshly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats because the president had long ruled out clemency for his son.</p><p>Mr. Biden has come under increasing pressure to use his clemency powers before he hands over power to President-elect Donald J. Trump. As a senator, Mr. Biden had championed a 1994 crime bill that many experts say fueled mass incarceration. He has since expressed regret for his support of the legislation, and he committed during the 2020 campaign to addressing the long drug sentences that resulted.</p><p>Some congressional Democrats and others have also called on Mr. Biden to reduce the sentences of all 40 people on death row to life without parole. Mr. Trump supports the death penalty and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/daniel-lewis-lee-execution-crime.html" title="">restarted federal executions</a> after a nearly 20-year pause during his first term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The fate of those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/27/us/politics/biden-prison-coronavirus.html" title="">who were moved to home confinement</a> during the pandemic, when Covid was spreading rapidly through jails and prisons, has been of particular concern to activists in recent weeks. Some Republicans, who are set to take control of Congress next month, have tried to push legislation that would have forced them to return to prison.</p><p>In his statement on Thursday, Mr. Biden said that many of those people would have received lower sentences if they had been charged under current laws. They had also been serving their sentences at home for at least a year, according to the White House.</p><p>“These commutation recipients, who were placed on home confinement during the Covid pandemic, have successfully reintegrated into their families and communities and have shown that they deserve a second chance,” he said.</p><p>The names of the recipients have not yet been provided.</p><p>Wendy Hechtman, one of the prisoners moved to home confinement during the pandemic, woke up in Buffalo on Thursday morning to her husband alerting her to Mr. Biden’s announcement. She is still serving a 15-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute a form of fentanyl and had been worried she would not be able to attend her daughter’s wedding next year in Quebec. Before Thursday, she had planned on calling into the wedding.</p><p>On Thursday morning, Ms. Hechtman was scrambling to find out if she was one of the 1,500 people whose sentences were eased by Mr. Biden.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I’ve had a gut feeling for months now that I was going to be able to go, and if my name is on that list? I will be dancing at my daughter’s wedding this summer,” Ms. Hechtman said in an interview. “I can’t wait.”</p><p>Mr. Biden said he would take more steps in the weeks ahead and continue to review clemency petitions. His staff has been debating whether he should issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">blanket pardons</a> for a number of Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies to protect them from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/trump-2024-president.html" title="">“retribution” he has threatened</a>, people familiar with the discussion have said.</p><p>White House officials do not believe the potential recipients have actually committed crimes, but they have grown increasingly worried that Mr. Trump’s selections for top Justice Department positions indicate that he will follow through on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/trump-prison-threats-opponents.html" title="">his repeated vows to seek revenge</a>. The idea would be to pre-emptively extend executive clemency to a list of current and former government officials, effectively short-circuiting the next president’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/politics/trump-enemies-prosecution.html" title="">promised campaign of reprisals</a>.</p><p>Until now, Mr. Biden has been relatively constrained in his use of the presidential act of forgiveness. He has issued 26 individual pardons and 135 commutations, according to a tally kept by the pardon attorney. The Office of the Pardon Attorney, part of the Justice Department, has received nearly 12,000 requests for clemency during Mr. Biden’s term.</p><p>The president has issued categorical pardons for people convicted of simple use and possession of marijuana, although none of those people were in prison when he made his decision. He also cleared the records of former service members convicted of violating the military’s former laws against homosexual conduct.</p><p>Mark Landler<!-- --> contributed reporting from London.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 12, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of a headline with this article misstated the action taken by President Biden. The president commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people; he did not pardon them. The error was repeated in a breaking news alert and email.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
