Planet warming-<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/20/upshot/carbon-dioxide-growth.html" title="">emissions keep rising</a>. Scientists warn of catastrophic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/11/climate/earth-warming-climate-tipping-points.html" title="">tipping points</a>.</p><p>Yet those headlines, crucially important as they are, often overshadow a different, equally important narrative: In recent years, the world has begun making rapid strides toward a cleaner, more resilient future, one in which modern society is powered with renewable energy, and the challenges of a hotter planet are not quite so perilous. This year alone, investments in clean energy will hit $2 trillion, according to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/investment-in-clean-energy-this-year-is-set-to-be-twice-the-amount-going-to-fossil-fuels" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Energy Agency</a>.</p><p>Today, in an effort to highlight some of the progress underway, we’re introducing a new regular feature in our coverage, The Climate Fix.</p><p>Each Thursday, as part of this newsletter, we’ll focus on at least one new solution that has the potential to make a meaningful difference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Sometimes, this might be a new technology that is making our energy system more efficient. Other weeks, it could be a policy change that is reshaping how people think about allocating money to climate adaptation. We also plan to cover nature-based solutions, emissions reductions plans, scientific breakthroughs and legal developments.</p><p>There’s no shortage of material for us to write about. On every continent and in every conceivable industry, there are projects making our energy systems cleaner, our transportation systems more efficient and our agricultural systems more resilient. And our reporters are already in the field, tracking developments in geothermal energy, electric vehicles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html" title="">rice farming</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/20/us/utah-spruce-forests.html" title="">tree planting</a> and much more. Just in the last few weeks, we’ve covered efforts to support <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/climate/michigan-nuclear-plant-palisades.html" title="">nuclear energy</a>, mine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/business/energy-environment/uranium-russia-united-states.html" title="">critical minerals</a> and the impact of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/climate/carbon-reduction-strategies.html" title="">individual actions</a>.</p><p>Beyond simply highlighting potentially game-changing solutions, The Climate Fix will bring a critical eye to them, evaluating what stands in the way of their widespread adoption, and peering ahead to understand what comes next.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and welcome to The Climate Fix.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>THE CLIMATE FIX</p><h2 id="link-7ddb2562">The fund that wants to pay billions to protect forests — and generate returns</h2><p><strong>The problem: </strong>Every year over the last two decades, countries have been losing about nine million acres of tropical forest that are crucial to curbing climate change. Markets for selling carbon credits and other financial mechanisms have not significantly changed that trend globally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>The fix: </strong>Officials from Brazil are finalizing a proposal for a new financial product called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125 billion from investors, countries and philanthropic organizations.</p><p>Its structure is unique: investors would loan the fund money, which would be paid back with interest. That money would then be invested in a diversified portfolio that would generate a return. Those excess returns would be used to pay roughly 70 developing countries $4 for every hectare of tropic forest they protect — including for forests that are not under immediate threat and which have historically received very little funding.</p><p>The structure means T.F.F.F. is more like a return-generating investment than traditional foreign aid, which the fund’s creators think could help make it more palatable for countries and philanthropies.</p><p>“We have long talked about the advantages of conservation, but haven’t been able to, let’s say, translate that into concrete things people can feel,” said Marina Silva, Brazil’s environment minister.</p><p><strong>The obstacles: </strong>Getting $125 billion in investments is an enormous challenge to say the least. If the T.F.F.F. were to raise $125 billion it would be, by some measures, the biggest climate fund in the world. There are also concerns about who would — or could — govern such a large financial portfolio. And then there’s the risk of a financial crash, which could hurt the fund’s abilities to pay countries for forest protection.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>What’s next: </strong>Officials in the U.S., Norway, France and other wealthy nations are evaluating the idea, as is the World Bank. The project, first presented at the global climate summit in Dubai, last November, is now in its final stages of design.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/climate/brazil-climate-fund-trees.html" title="">Read the full article here</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-5bb8f72e">Turning rivers and oceans into giant sponges for carbon dioxide</h2><p><strong>The problem: </strong>To keep climate change at tolerable levels, countries will probably have to do more than just slash emissions — they’ll also need to remove hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere this century.</p><p><strong>The fix: </strong>In Nova Scotia, a startup called CarbonRun is grinding up limestone and sprinkling it into rivers poisoned by acid rain. Not only does this technique help local salmon populations, it also helps pull greenhouse gases from the sky.</p><p>Typically, rivers contain carbon dioxide that is constantly escaping into the air, where it traps heat and warms the planet. But adding limestone converts some of that carbon dioxide into a stable molecule that instead stays underwater and washes into the sea, where it should remain trapped for thousands of years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>The potential: </strong>There are hundreds of acidified rivers worldwide, and CarbonRun estimates that this process, known as river liming, could remove hundreds of millions of tons of carbon each year.</p><p>That might just be a start. If similar techniques could be done in the ocean — adding an alkaline substance like limestone or magnesium oxide to seawater, for example — humanity could potentially remove billions of tons each year.</p><p>So far, oceans have been tougher to work in. It’s tricky to prove that adding alkalinity actually removes carbon in the turbulent high seas, and early research efforts have faced public backlash. Some scientists hope CarbonRun can be a pioneer, because it’s easier to verify carbon removal happens in rivers, and river liming has been highly popular with local communities, since it can help revive devastated fisheries.</p><p><strong>The obstacles: </strong>CarbonRun needs to cut costs, which means figuring out how to inexpensively mine and transport limestone. The company needs about two tons of rock for every ton of carbon it removes.</p><p>The company also needs buyers. Right now, only a handful of wealthy tech companies, like Microsoft and Stripe, are willing to pay startups to remove carbon from the air. Some experts say carbon removal should be considered a public good and governments should pay for it, but it’s still early days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>One policy twist: Congress offers a generous tax credit — worth $180 per ton — for companies that remove carbon from the air using complex direct air capture machines, but that subsidy does not cover techniques that involve oceans or rivers.</p><p><strong>What’s next: </strong>CarbonRun has received $25 million to remove an initial 55,442 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is starting to scale up. Elsewhere, researchers in Halifax and Massachusetts are studying whether alkalinity enhancement can work in the oceans. — <em>Brad Plumer</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/climate/oceans-rivers-carbon-removal.html" title="">Read the full article here</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Floodwaters from Hurricane Helene in Swannanoa, N.C., on Sept. 27.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Belleme for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-1d160c29">3 Things to Read on Hurricane Helene</h2><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/climate/north-carolina-homes-helene-building-codes.html" title="">How the North Carolina Legislature Left Homes Vulnerable to Helene</a></strong>: “Over the past 15 years, North Carolina lawmakers have rejected limits on construction on steep slopes, which might have reduced the number of homes lost to landslides; blocked a rule requiring homes to be elevated above the height of an expected flood; weakened protections for wetlands, increasing the risk of dangerous storm water runoff; and slowed the adoption of updated building codes, making it harder for the state to qualify for federal climate-resilience grants.” <em>— Christopher Flavelle</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/fema-floods-north-carolina.html" title="">After Flooding, FEMA Aid Is Arriving.

But first, legal groups in the area need to account for their own people.” <em>— Karen Zraick</em></p></div></div></section></article></div>
