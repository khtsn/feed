It’s one of the reasons I won — but they actually came out with a directive. Too white.”</em></p><p><strong>This is misleading. </strong>Mr. Trump was citing efforts to recruit people with certain disabilities for air traffic operations that began under his own administration, though the language concerning hiring those with disabilities more generally preceded his first term. And there is no evidence that the government’s efforts to recruit more people with disabilities or the Obama or Biden administration’s diversity efforts were to blame for the crash.</p><p>It is unclear whether Mr. Trump was referring to information that is not widely known, but at the time of his remarks, the identities of the pilots and air traffic controllers involved had not been made public.</p><p>Under Mr. Trump in April 2019, the F.A.A. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-provides-aviation-careers-people-disabilities" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced a pilot program</a> for 20 people with targeted disabilities to work in air traffic operations. Targeted disabilities are a set of <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47316/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statutorily defined</a> disabilities, including, but not limited to, those cited by Mr. Trump, that the federal government emphasizes for recruiting. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718165523/https://www.faa.gov/jobs/diversity_inclusion/aviation_development_program/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">archived page from June 2019</a> named the initiative the Aviation Development Program, which “provides an opportunity for persons with targeted disabilities to gain aviation knowledge and experience as an air traffic control student trainee.”</p><p>“The candidates in this program will receive the same rigorous consideration in terms of aptitude, medical and security qualifications as those individuals considered for a standard public opening for air traffic controller jobs,” the F.A.A. said in 2019. Those standards include passing an air traffic skills assessment and a medical exam.</p><p>According to <a href="https://medium.com/faa/a-career-path-for-air-traffic-controllers-with-disabilities-9e5ca577aa0c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Medium post from the agency</a>, one of the program’s first three candidates graduated in 2021 from the F.A.A. Academy and became an air traffic controller trainee that year. It is unclear how many people who graduated from that program are air traffic controllers today.</p><p>Moreover, experts said they could not cite a known instance of a plane crash in which diversity efforts had been cited as the sole cause.</p><p>“Historically, there has never been an incident, big or small, where D.E.I. or diversity has ever been attributed as a sole cause or contributing cause,” said Tennessee Garvey, a pilot and the chairman of the board of directors for the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals.</p><p>He added that the rigorous standards for hiring pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers were never relaxed to meet diversity goals, but rather that previous administrations and the commercial air industry overall have worked to remove barriers to entry.</p><p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/tuskegee-stearman-180960368/#:~:text=Airlines%20kept%20plenty%20of%20white,he%20retired%20from%20the%20military." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Of the more than 900 Black pilots</a> who made up the Tuskegee Airmen, only one became a commercial pilot, he said. And segregation <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/5433/chapter/7#116" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prevented Black men and women from working in the industry</a> until the civil rights movement and lawsuits.</p><p>Robert Fowler Jr., a pilot and professor of aerospace at Middle Tennessee State University, said that costs and time required to qualify for a pilot’s license were still significant obstacles. Despite the industry’s attempt to provide scholarships and cast a wider recruiting net, diversity efforts have not been all that successful.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s more specific claims about the F.A.A.’s attempts at recruiting people with disabilities ignore his first administration’s embrace of that approach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s more specific claims about the F.A.A.’s attempts to recruit people with disabilities ignore his first administration’s embrace of that approach.</p><p>As Snopes, the rumor-debunking website, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/01/15/faa-dei-initiatives/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has reported</a>, language on the Federal Aviation Administration’s website says that the agency “actively recruits, hires, promotes, retains, develops and advances people with disabilities.” That specific page appeared as early as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130226035813/http://www.faa.gov/jobs/diversity_inclusion/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">February 2013</a> and remained unchanged through the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190120002436/https://www.faa.gov/jobs/diversity_inclusion/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240117095423/https://www.faa.gov/jobs/diversity_inclusion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Biden</a> administrations. It is no longer on the agency’s website.</p><p>The list of the F.A.A.’s “targeted disabilities” cited by Mr. Trump was also present on the agency’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630124751/https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/acr/outreach/pwd/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website during the Trump administration.</a> Those include the disabilities Mr. Trump cited as well as hearing, vision, missing extremities and paralysis.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the general federal policy for hiring people with disabilities dates back even further, to the Bush administration in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110901052035/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/acr/eeo_affirm_program/manag_direc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2003</a> and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-XIV/part-1614/subpart-B/section-1614.203" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 1973 law.</a></p><p>That law, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, initially protected veterans with disabilities from discrimination in federal programs and was expanded through the years to encompass nonveterans and hiring practices.</p><p>In 2003, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/management-directive/instructions-federal-agencies-eeo-md-715" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">governmentwide directive</a> that instructed each government agency to include an annual mission statement, pledge to offer equal employment opportunity regardless of “race, religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin, age, genetic information or disability” and to continually identify and remove barriers to that goal.</p><p>While the F.A.A. under several recent administrations and the aviation industry overall have tried to diversify their ranks, including hiring more people with disabilities, progress has been slow.</p><p>Annual reports from the F.A.A. show a slight, but not significant, increase in diversity. In <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/acr/FY_2016_MD_715_Report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2016</a>, 58.9 percent of its work force consisted of white men and 0.7 percent had targeted disabilities.

The lawsuit accused the agency under the Obama administration of discriminating against them because its hiring practices were “engineered to favor racial minorities.” That lawsuit is pending in court.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Linda Qiu is a reporter who specializes in fact-checking statements made by politicians and public figures.
