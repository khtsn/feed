Forecasters warned it could cause “catastrophic life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides” in Guerrero and nearby Michoacán State.</p><p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm may grow stronger overnight, but that its location so near to the coast may keep it from doing so. The storm’s center was expected to reach the coast on Thursday night, where hurricane conditions were “imminent,” the center said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-2"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="john-map-path-embed" data-id="100000009712891" data-source-id="100000009712891"><div data-sourceid="100000009712891" id="embed-id-100000009712891">

The storm also shut down airports and halted operations at a major cargo port this week. To prevent people from being electrocuted, the authorities also cut the power of an entire district in Acapulco, leaving 1,170 users without electricity.</p><p>On Wednesday evening, the storm’s winds had increased to 70 m.p.h. as it moved back toward land. The storm was expected to produce 10 to 20 inches of rainfall across portions of Guerrero and Michoacán by the end of the week, <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_ep5+shtml/174728.shtml?rainqpf#contents" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the U.S. National Hurricane Center said</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Scientists say the category rating of a storm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/climate/tropical-storm-debby-danger.html" title="">can fail to fully capture</a> how destructive it is. A hurricane’s rating on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which runs from 1 to 5, is based only on its maximum sustained wind speed, not on the rain, storm surges or tornadoes it produces.</p><p>John is the 10th named storm to form in the Eastern Pacific in 2024, and it is moving through the region at the same time as a powerful Atlantic storm, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/26/weather/tropical-storm-helene-hurricane" title="">Hurricane Helene</a>, is churning in the Gulf of Mexico on its way to a likely landfall in Florida on Thursday.</p><p>The two storms are related in a way — they both originated from the same parent system, called the central American gyre, and it is a broad, widespread area of storms across Central America that has spun up both Helene and John. This same broad quality of the storm is what is going to make Helene such a large hurricane as it spins in the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida.</p><p>A recent study showed that rapid intensification, as in the case of John, is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/climate/hurricane-intensity-stronger-faster.html" title="">twice as likely</a>, at least for Atlantic hurricanes, partially because of human-caused climate change driven by the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>Johnny Diaz<!-- -->, <!-- -->John Yoon<!-- -->, <!-- -->Emiliano Rodríguez Mega<!-- --> <!-- -->Judson Jones<!-- --> and <!-- -->Derrick Bryson Taylor<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
