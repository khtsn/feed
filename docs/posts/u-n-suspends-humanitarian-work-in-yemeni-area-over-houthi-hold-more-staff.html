    <h1>U.N. Suspends Humanitarian Work in Yemeni Area Over Houthi Hold More Staff</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.N. also said it had stopped all staff travel to Houthi-controlled areas after the detentions.</p><p>The Houthis, the de facto rulers of parts of Yemen including the capital, Sana, are backed by Iran. They have been engaged in a campaign of kidnappings and detention of hundreds of people who work for the U.N. and foreign nongovernment agencies, along with dozens of current and former <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/houthi-militia-arrests-spying-us.html" title="">Yemenis employed by the U.S. government</a>, according to the U.N.</p><p>The U.N. did not clarify how many Yemenis were affected by the suspension of its humanitarian aid operation, which it said included providing food, clean water and medical kits. But the U.N. identifies Yemen as having the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 80 percent of its 24.1 million people in need of essential aid and three million displaced.</p><p>Saada, the area where the U.N. suspended operations, is north of Sana and has a population of about one million people. Several U.N. agencies operate in Saada, including the World Food Program, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and other aid groups.</p><p>Mr. Haq, the U.N. spokesman, said the decision to stop operations did not come easily and was heavily debated within the organization. “This is not a normal procedure or something we do frequently,” he said, adding that the decision reflected the gravity of the safety concerns for the U.N.’s operations in Yemen.</p><p>The U.N. operates in war zones around the world, including Gaza, Myanmar, Sudan and Ukraine, and its staff faces high risks and duress, but it seldom shuts down its operations. In the war in Gaza, for example, the U.N. has said that nearly 300 of its staff members have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza — the highest number of U.N. employees killed in any conflict — but the work continued.</p></div></div>
