The building has more than 1,300 units, and the Jack Parker Corporation had received lucrative tax breaks through <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/property/benefits-j51.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a city program</a> to renovate the apartments but keep them rent-stabilized.</p><p>“This settlement is more than just a settlement for these families,” said Aaron Carr, the founder and executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group, the <a href="https://www.housingrightsus.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Housing Rights Initiative</a>, which investigated the overcharges that led to the lawsuit. “It means more money for food, health care and housing in one of the most unaffordable cities on planet Earth.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Blackstone, a major investor in real estate around the world, moved to settle the case soon after purchasing the complex but has spent years wrangling with Newman Ferrara, the law firm representing the renters.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Aaron Carr, left, the founder of the Housing Rights Initiative, at a news conference in 2018.

The firm said in a statement that the firm was pleased to have resolved the case, which began before they owned the building. It said it has invested $70 million in the complex and is “focused on delivering an exceptional resident experience.”</p><p>The Jack Parker Corporation did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The settlement is one example of how the complex rules governing the rent-stabilization system in New York City can be frustrating for renters struggling to hold landlords accountable. The rent-stabilization system covers some one million apartments, or nearly half of the city’s rentals, and is an important source of affordable housing.</p><p>It can be hard for New Yorkers to understand how much their rent should be, what units are covered or what to do if they think their landlord is doing something wrong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Advocates for tenants and city and state officials encourage residents to <a href="https://app.justfix.org/en/rh/splash" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">request the rent history</a> of their apartments from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees the rent-stabilization system, to investigate irregularities. But even those can be difficult to understand, and the state does not guarantee the accuracy of the ledgers.</p><p>Mr. Carr said the state should be doing more to proactively investigate these types of cases, and that there are many more beyond Parker Towers.</p><p>“The burden is placed on everyday people who don’t have the time to study thousands of pages of real estate law,” Mr. Carr said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators marched outside offices of Blackstone and the Real Estate Board of New York in April to protest high rent and demand more tenant protections.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emil Salman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The Division of Housing and Community Renewal said that over the past five years, it has returned nearly $13.2 million in overcharges to renters. In the fiscal year ending in 2023, the most recent data available, the division processed 800 complaints of rent overcharges, more than double the total from two years before that. The division&#39;s tenant protection unit also began more than 2,800 investigations across the state, according to the department.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The division said renters who think they are being inappropriately charged should call its Office of Rent Administration at 833-499-0343.</p><p>Several <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/ag-james-secures-more-613000-developers-flouting-rent-stabilization-requirements" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cases</a>, including a few that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/nyregion/nyc-landlords-tax-fraud.html" title="">resulted in criminal action</a>, have helped shed light on how some landlords have sought to evade requirements.</p><p>In this case, the landlord received a property tax exemption, known as J-51, from 1998 to 2011 in exchange for making renovations to the complex, according to court papers. Mr. Carr said a Parker Towers tenant contacted his group, which examined property tax records and rent ledgers provided by tenants and found that many of the units were not properly rent-stabilized.</p><p>In 2019, Blackstone <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2019/04/19/blackstone-equity-firm-coughs-up-1-million-refund-to-forest-hill-tenants-non-profit-says/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreed to pay</a> a total of more than $1 million to tenants who still live in the complex who claimed they were being charged too much.</p><p>An additional $14,750,000 is now being distributed to more than 100 households, including people who used to live in the complex, according to court papers. A judge approved the settlement in September.</p><p>The exact amount of money each household is getting through the settlement is confidential, Mr. Carr said, but it is based on how long they lived in the apartments and how much they were overcharged.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Priest, the Power Broker and the Pop Star: </strong>A monsignor is in hot water with his diocese as prosecutors look into his dealings with Mayor Eric Adams’s top adviser. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/nyregion/sabrina-carpenter-church-frank-carone.html">It all started with Sabrina Carpenter</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disappearing Dining Sheds: </strong>Street side sheds helped keep New York restaurants afloat during the coronavirus pandemic.
