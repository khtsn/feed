He will pick up the trip on Tuesday with a stop at a slavery museum and then travel south on Wednesday to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/africa/biden-angola-visit.html" title="">highlight a new $1 billion rail corridor</a>.</p><p>Mr. Biden had long promised to visit sub-Saharan Africa, but the trip was delayed until the final weeks of his presidency. He is the first American president to travel to the region since 2015.</p><p>He had hoped to draw attention to his commitment to Africa at a time when the United States is in competition on the continent with China. But that message was quickly overwhelmed by his announcement hours before taking off from Washington that he was issuing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/biden-pardon-son-hunter.html" title="">a “full and unconditional” pardon</a> to Hunter Biden, his 54-year-old son.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hunter Biden was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/11/us/hunter-biden-trial-verdict" title="">convicted this year</a> of lying on a firearms application form and later pleaded guilty to failure to pay taxes. The president’s decision to pardon his son came despite repeated promises not to do so, and it drew criticism from Republicans and some Democrats for using his power to overturn the judicial process.</p><p>Mr. Biden did not speak with reporters traveling with him, leaving it to his White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, to deflect questions from reporters on the plane about whether he lied when he said he would not pardon his son.</p><p>“He wrestled with it,” she told reporters. “He thought about it. And he believed and what he saw was that his son was singled out. And so he made this decision.”</p><p>The president used his refueling stop in Cape Verde to meet with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and thank the island nation for its support of Ukraine in its war against Russian invaders. Many other African countries had either stayed neutral or expressed support for Russia. His staff issued a statement hailing Cape Verde as “a model of stable democratic governance” and “the freest country in all of Africa.”</p><p>No sitting president has ever visited Angola, a longtime Portuguese colony that after winning independence in 1975 endured more than a quarter-century of civil war as a battleground in the Cold War conflict between the United States and Soviet Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the two decades since the end of the war, Angola has built a more prosperous nation on the back of oil and diamond resources, and is now a center of the economic competition between the United States and China.</p><p>To demonstrate American commitment, Mr. Biden plans to announce <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/12/01/background-press-call-on-the-presidents-travel-to-angola/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a variety of investments</a> in global health, agriculture and security cooperation during the trip. He will celebrate a U.S. government initiative that has connected American and Angolan businesses for deals totaling $6.9 billion. But the life span of such commitments will also hinge on the will of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who once disparaged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/trump-shithole-countries.html" title="">African nations with an expletive.</a></p><p>John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman for the president, rejected the impression that Mr. Biden’s trip falling so late in his term undermined his message of support. He noted that 20 cabinet level officials have visited the continent, and cited American investment.</p><p>“I just kind of push back on the premise that this is sort of a Johnny-come-lately trip at the very end,” he said. “This is something he’s been focused on since he became president of the United States.”</p><p>Mr. Kirby also disputed the notion that the United States was pitted against other major powers for economic influence in the region. “There is no cold war on the continent,” he said. “We’re not asking countries to choose between us and Russia and China.”</p><p>But without naming China, he went on to describe the pitfalls that some African nations have faced as a result of Chinese investment: “Too many countries have relied on spotty investment opportunities and are now racked by debt.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
