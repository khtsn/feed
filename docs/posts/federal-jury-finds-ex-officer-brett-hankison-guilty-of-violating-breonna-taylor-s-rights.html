But his shots did not kill Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who worked as an emergency room technician. Two other officers, also white, fired the fatal shots, but neither was charged.</p><p>After the verdict, <a href="https://x.com/isaiah_km/status/1852535299588440362?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Hankison silently walked out of the federal courthouse</a> and stepped into a waiting S.U.V. He declined to answer a reporter’s questions. Mr. Hankison’s lawyers could not immediately be reached.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced in March.</p><p>It is not the first time that Mr. Hankison has faced a jury in the case. Last year, a judge declared a mistrial after jurors failed to come to a unanimous verdict on federal civil rights charges. He was previously acquitted of similar state charges.</p><p>Prosecutors argued in the first federal trial that Mr. Hankison did not have legal justification to use deadly force when he fired through a window and sliding glass door covered by blinds, ultimately hitting a neighboring apartment. He testified that he had been frightened and believed that someone in Ms. Taylor’s home was still shooting at his colleagues.</p><p>Officers were seeking evidence that Ms. Taylor’s former boyfriend was selling drugs when they barged through her door on March 13, 2020. They were met by gunfire from her current boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who later said he believed the officers were intruders. Mr. Walker fired a bullet that hit an officer in the leg.</p><p>Two officers, Myles Cosgrove and Jonathan Mattingly, immediately returned fire and shot Ms. Taylor. But they were never charged; prosecutors argued that they had been justified in their actions.</p><p>The warrant to raid the apartment was based on shoddy surveillance. Three officers were charged by federal prosecutors with knowingly including false information in an affidavit to get a judge to approve the raid. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/us/breonna-taylor-officer-guilty-plea.html" title="">pleaded guilty in 2022</a>. The case against the two other officers, Joshua Jaynes and Kyle Meany, is still open.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The killing brought national attention to “no-knock” warrants, which allow the police to burst into homes without warning. A judge initially signed off on such a warrant for Ms. Taylor’s apartment, but the officers were later instructed to announce themselves. Whether they actually did has long been in dispute.</p><p>The Louisville Metro Police Department faced intense scrutiny after Ms. Taylor’s death, and activists protested in the city for months. The police chief was fired in 2020 amid the demonstrations, and a report by the Justice Department last year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/us/politics/louisville-police-breonna-taylor-justice-dept.html" title="">found that the department</a> had shown a pattern of discriminating against Black people.</p><p>On Friday, Ms. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict against Mr. Hankison and noted that it had been more than 1,000 days since her daughter’s death.</p><p>“It took a lot of patience,” <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/videos/news/crime/2024/11/01/breonna-taylor-family-speaks-following-ex-lmpd-detective-brett-hankison-guilty-verdict/76004402007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said outside the courthouse</a>. “It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/breonna-taylor">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/brett-hankison">Brett Hankison</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/police-department-louisville-ky">Police Department (Louisville, Ky)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Facebook Marketplace Chefs: </strong>The platform, which is often used for furniture and electronics, is an increasingly popular place for unlicensed restaurateurs across the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/facebook-marketplace-food.html">to sell home-cooked meals</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Taxpayers Help Health Insurers Make Profits: </strong>Local governments often face extra fees when employees get out-of-network medical care, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/healthcare-taxpayer-money-insurance.html">some don’t track the insurance charges or even know about them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defining the Midwest: </strong>From the geographic boundaries to the values and friendliness, people have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/us/midwest-states-harris-trump.html">debated what defines the Midwest for 200 years</a>.
