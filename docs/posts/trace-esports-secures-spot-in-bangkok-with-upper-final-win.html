</span>, Trace won it in a three-map series to return to international play.</p>

<p>Bind was the starter for the series, with Trace showing their Vyse-Deadlock composition as Bilibili went with the more standard variation using Viper and Cypher. Starting on the attack side, Trace won the pistol and converted the bonus round to show off that same Bind dominance that allowed them to sweep EDward Gaming earlier in the tournament. Bilibili took some rounds back thanks to some good rounds from <span data-ref-id="1">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4885/whzy">
		whzy	</a>
</span>, preventing the steamroll Trace had their last time out on Bind and ending the half 6-6.</p>

<p>Now on the attack side, Bilibili won their pistol to pressure Trace, keeping the game close as the second half went on. It all came down to <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/37494/kai">
		Kai	</a>
</span>, the star of the map, holding strong on Vyse with an ace to help Trace complete Bind 13-8.</p>


<p><em>Kai gets the defensive ace against Bilibili.</em></p>

<p>Haven was map two, and an eco win from Trace quickly countered a pistol win from Bilibili and helped fashion another lead. The two teams were highlighted by their Neon players, as both whzy and Kai remained hot even as they swapped agents from map one. The teams remained as even as they were to start the first half of Bind, entering the half tied at 6-6 once again. Just as Bilibili won their second pistol and nearly got ecoed for the second time, BLG converted their bonus to keep the map and series in reach.</p>

<p>Just as it looked like Bilibili could run away with the map, <span data-ref-id="3">

<p>It seemed like the beginning of the end for BLG, but the team held strong and fought to take the lead late and <span data-ref-id="4">

		nephh	</a>
</span> got the final kill to win Haven 13-10 and tie the series at one.</p>

<p>The decider was Lotus, with Trace moving Kai back on Vyse while BLG returned to whzy on Raze. Trace took the first pistol by the skin of their teeth but used it to build an early lead. Trace&#39;s attack was defined by slow attacks, but meticulous post-plants. Even in positions like a 3v5 in round six, Trace still ended the round with the win, and that led the team to get the first halftime lead of the series.</p>

<p>Up 8-4, Trace won their second pistol of the map and kept the momentum up to close the map out 13-6 and the series 2-1. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4770/fengf">
		FengF	</a>
</span> was the star in closing the series out, as his Raze stood out across both maps one and three.</p>

<p>With this win, Trace Esports is going to both the China Kickoff grand finals and Masters Bangkok, while Bilibili Gaming will have another chance to qualify through the lower bracket finals against either <span data-ref-id="6">
