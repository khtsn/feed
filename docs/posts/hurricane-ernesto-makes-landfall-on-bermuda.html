Ferry services were suspended, and bus services were being halted Friday evening. L.F. Wade International Airport will close its doors at 8:30 p.m. on Friday, with officials indicating it will remain shut through Sunday. Both American Airlines and United Airlines have added additional flights to accommodate the surge of travelers seeking refuge on the East Coast of the United States.</p><p>The primary road connecting the airport to the main island will be closed to all traffic from 10 p.m. on Friday, further limiting access.</p><p>Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, emphasized the urgency of the situation, telling residents, “I urge you to act now. Time is running out.”</p><p>Bermuda is a small island in a vast ocean. It is well-practiced in dealing with hurricane-force winds, but it has only sustained a direct hit nine times since 1851, according to <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=6.94/32.328/-64.766&amp;search=eyJzZWFyY2hTdHJpbmciOiJCZXJtdWRhIiwic2VhcmNoVHlwZSI6Imdlb2NvZGVkIiwib3NtSUQiOiIxOTkzMjA4IiwiY2F0ZWdvcmllcyI6WyJINSIsIkg0IiwiSDMiLCJIMiIsIkgxIl0sInllYXJzIjpbXSwibW9udGhzIjpbXSwiZW5zbyI6W10sInByZXNzdXJlIjp7InJhbmdlIjpbMCwxMDMwXSwiaW5jbHVkZVVua25vd25QcmVzc3VyZSI6dHJ1ZX0sImJ1ZmZlciI6NzAsImJ1ZmZlclVuaXQiOlsiTWlsZXMiXSwic29ydFNlbGVjdGlvbiI6eyJ2YWx1ZSI6InllYXJzX25ld2VzdCIsImxhYmVsIjoiWWVhciAoTmV3ZXN0KSJ9LCJhcHBseVRvQU9JIjp0cnVlLCJpc1N0b3JtTGFiZWxzVmlzaWJsZSI6dHJ1ZX0=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s historical hurricane database</a>. The last storm to make landfall on the Island was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/world/americas/hurricane-epsilon.html" title="">Paulette on Sept. 14, 2020</a>, knocking down power lines but causing only minimal property damage.</p><p>The most memorable Bermuda hurricane of the 21st century didn’t make landfall. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/05/national/hurricane-bears-down-on-bermuda-islands.html" title="">Hurricane Fabian</a> instead passed just to the west of the Island on Sept. 5, 2003, killing four sailors and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/world/world-briefing-africa-bermuda-slow-cleanup-after-hurricane.html" title="">forcing a quarter of Bermuda’s hotels and</a> guesthouses to close for repairs. While Ernesto is forecast to be slightly weaker than Fabian, it will take a similar track, moving north and passing over or just west of Bermuda, which will likely push the worst damaging winds and surge right onto the island.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ernesto is not expected to approach the mainland United States, but forecasters warned that swells and rip currents were likely to affect the East Coast through the weekend. The New York office of the Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/nwsnewyorkny/status/1824251705304944978?s=46&amp;t=btsi_vkrnKd3vNNuaDxgIw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned swimmers</a> to stay out of the water. The storm is expected to move off the coast of Canada early next week.</p><p>This week, Ernesto brought significant rain to Puerto Rico, where up to 10 inches of rain had fallen in some places by midday on Wednesday, the Weather Service said. The storm knocked out power to more than 600,000 customers, and many were still waiting for it to be restored. Early Friday, Luma Energy, which distributes electricity in the territory, said that nearly 250,000 customers were still without power. <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=SJU&amp;issuedby=SJU&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Excessive heat warnings</a> were in place for parts of the island, and forecasters warned people to take precautions to stay safe.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Rainwater flows over a four-lane road surrounded by trees.

Hurricane seasons produce 14 named storms on average from June 1 through Nov. 30.</p><p>The seasonal hurricane outlooks were notably aggressive, because forecasters looking at the start of the season saw a combination of circumstances that didn’t exist in records dating back to the mid-1800s: record warm water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and the potential formation of the weather pattern known as La Niña.</p><p>La Niña occurs in the Pacific because of changing ocean temperatures, and it affects weather patterns globally.
