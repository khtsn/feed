Large, destructive waves were expected near the coast.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Starting around 4 p.m. local time on Friday, many households found themselves in the dark. Outages affected more than 25,000 customers early Saturday morning. <a href="https://belco.bm/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BELCO</a>, Bermuda’s sole electricity provider, said it was not safe for its crews to be in the field late Friday. It said it would resume work on restoring power when conditions improved.</p><p>The storm has prompted a near-total shutdown of Bermuda’s transportation services. Ferry services were suspended, and bus services were halted Friday evening.</p><p>L.F. Wade International Airport planned to close Friday night. American Airlines and United Airlines added flights to accommodate the surge of travelers seeking refuge on the East Coast of the United States.</p><p>Bermuda is well-practiced in dealing with hurricane-force winds but, before this week, it had only sustained a direct hit nine times since 1851, according to <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=6.94/32.328/-64.766&amp;search=eyJzZWFyY2hTdHJpbmciOiJCZXJtdWRhIiwic2VhcmNoVHlwZSI6Imdlb2NvZGVkIiwib3NtSUQiOiIxOTkzMjA4IiwiY2F0ZWdvcmllcyI6WyJINSIsIkg0IiwiSDMiLCJIMiIsIkgxIl0sInllYXJzIjpbXSwibW9udGhzIjpbXSwiZW5zbyI6W10sInByZXNzdXJlIjp7InJhbmdlIjpbMCwxMDMwXSwiaW5jbHVkZVVua25vd25QcmVzc3VyZSI6dHJ1ZX0sImJ1ZmZlciI6NzAsImJ1ZmZlclVuaXQiOlsiTWlsZXMiXSwic29ydFNlbGVjdGlvbiI6eyJ2YWx1ZSI6InllYXJzX25ld2VzdCIsImxhYmVsIjoiWWVhciAoTmV3ZXN0KSJ9LCJhcHBseVRvQU9JIjp0cnVlLCJpc1N0b3JtTGFiZWxzVmlzaWJsZSI6dHJ1ZX0=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s historical hurricane database</a>.

The New York office of the Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/nwsnewyorkny/status/1824251705304944978?s=46&amp;t=btsi_vkrnKd3vNNuaDxgIw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned swimmers</a> to stay out of the water. The storm is expected to move off the coast of Canada early next week.</p><p>This week, Ernesto brought significant rain to Puerto Rico, where up to 10 inches of rain had fallen in some places by midday on Wednesday, the Weather Service said.</p><p>The storm knocked out power to more than 600,000 customers. Many were still waiting for it to be restored. Late on Friday, Luma Energy, which distributes electricity in the territory, said that more than 171,000 customers were still without power.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Rainwater flows over a four-lane road surrounded by trees.

Hurricane seasons produce 14 named storms on average from June 1 through Nov. 30.</p><p>The seasonal hurricane outlooks were notably aggressive, because forecasters looking at the start of the season saw a combination of circumstances that didn’t exist in records dating back to the mid-1800s: record warm water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and the potential formation of the weather pattern known as La Niña.</p><p>La Niña occurs in the Pacific because of changing ocean temperatures, and it affects weather patterns globally. When it is strong, it typically provides a calm environment in the Atlantic; this allows storms to develop more easily and to strengthen without interference from wind patterns that might otherwise keep them from organizing.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Patricia Mazzei<!-- -->, <!-- -->Camille Baker<!-- -->, <!-- -->John Yoon<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hank Sanders<!-- --> and <!-- -->Yan Zhuang<!-- -->.</p></div></div><div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/article/tropical-storm-ernesto-hurricane.html">8</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/article/tropical-storm-ernesto-hurricane.html">8</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
