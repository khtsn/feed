<p>Like Americas and EMEA, the draw was divided into two pools, with the first pool including teams from the region that made <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions 2024</a>. Those teams received a bye from the first round, qualifying for the upper bracket&#39;s quarterfinals. The second pool has the region&#39;s remaining eight teams, which were drawn against each other with the winners facing teams from the first pool.</p>
