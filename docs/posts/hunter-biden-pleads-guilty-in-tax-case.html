It was not part of a plea deal in exchange for reduced punishment.</p><p>Mr. Biden, speaking in a low and clipped voice as he sat at the defense table, repeated the word “guilty” nine times as Judge Mark C. Scarsi ticked off each charge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He will remain free on bond until his sentencing hearing in mid-December.</p><p>The guilty plea now exposes President Biden’s son to an outcome that seemed unthinkable last year, when his lawyers were on the cusp of a no-prison plea agreement: significant time behind bars. He now faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 17 years or a fine of up to $1.3 million, on top of the possible sentence of 25 years after being convicted of lying on a firearms application in Delaware in June.</p><p>It does not appear, at least for now, that he is banking on executive parental reprieve. As Hunter Biden’s team appeared in court, listening intently while every word of his 56-page criminal indictment was read back to him, the White House press secretary told reporters, “It’s still very much a no,” when asked if the president planned to pardon his son.</p><p>The guilty plea came a few hours after Mr. Biden, 54, made a more conditional offer — a so-called <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/alford_plea#:~:text=An%20Alford%20plea%2C%20also%20known,innocence%20toward%20those%20same%20charges." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alford plea</a> — in which he acknowledged there was enough evidence to convict him even as he professed innocence toward the same charges. But that did not work.</p><p>His team changed course after prosecutors said they would oppose any plea in which Mr. Biden did not accept unconditional guilt, and Judge Scarsi suggested he was inclined to move forward with the case.</p><p>“Enough is enough,” Abbe Lowell, one of Mr. Biden’s lawyers, said by midafternoon.</p><p>Mr. Lowell said Mr. Biden had decided to plead guilty “so he and his family don’t have to spend one more day focusing on something that happened when he was a man addicted to drugs,” adding: “It’s time to move on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Biden believes that David C. Weiss, the special counsel in the case, had refused to engage in serious plea negotiations after being sharply criticized for signing a generous agreement with Mr. Biden on gun and tax charges that would have resulted in no prison time.</p><p>That agreement imploded during a chaotic hearing at the federal courthouse in Wilmington in July 2023, and Mr. Weiss subsequently indicted Mr. Biden on charges of lying on a firearms application in Delaware and on a range of tax violations in California, where he now lives.</p><p>The atmosphere in the courtroom in sunny Los Angeles was tense, clamorous and chaotic.</p><p>Leo J. Wise, the hard-driving Weiss deputy overseeing the government’s case, said he was stunned when the Biden team interrupted the first day of jury selection with an offer to end the trial on their terms. And he took offense when Mr. Lowell suggested that the government had subjected his client to an unfair prosecution influenced by external political pressures.</p><p>“This idea that he’s a victim of this process, it’s offensive,” Mr. Wise said. “We have not exacted a pound of flesh or a drop of blood. We have afforded him the same right as any American.”</p><p>Yet much of the courtroom drama had already been drained of its national significance. Mr. Biden’s trial on tax charges went from a central election-year saga to a political afterthought the moment President Biden withdrew from the 2024 race in July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Paradoxically, the personal stakes have never been higher for his son — a first-time offender who will likely make the case for the lightest permissible sentence, probation instead of prison time, after pleading guilty to evading a tax assessment, failing to file and pay taxes, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return.</p><p>In doing so, Mr. Biden’s legal team will argue that he has been clean and sober for years, paid all of his back taxes and penalties and has expressed contrition to his family and associates for his drug-fueled behavior.</p><p>People close to Mr. Biden say he has been desperately seeking a way out of the tax trial for weeks in hopes of avoiding a reprise of the weeklong gun case, which included testimony from his ex-romantic partners, including the widow of his brother Beau.</p><p>Mr. Wise had signaled his intention to call many of the same witnesses in Los Angeles in court filings — and Mr. Biden was particularly concerned about the possibility that his daughters Naomi and Maisy would be called to testify, they added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
