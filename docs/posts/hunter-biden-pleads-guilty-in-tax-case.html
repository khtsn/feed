Angeles after telling his legal team that he refused to subject his family to another round of anguish and humiliation after a gut-wrenching gun trial in Delaware three months ago.</p><p>The dramatic development signaled the final stages of a fraught investigation of more than five years into the period when Mr. Biden bankrolled his uncontrollable drug and alcohol addiction by leveraging his last name into lucrative overseas consulting contracts — and not paying taxes.</p><p>This was a plea without a deal, a unilateral decision by defense lawyers persuaded they could not prevail in the trial — and not part of a settlement that included a reduced punishment.</p><p>Mr. Biden, 54, speaking in a low and clipped voice as he sat at the defense table, repeated the word “guilty” nine times as Judge Mark C. Scarsi ticked off each charge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He will remain free on bond until his sentencing hearing in mid-December.</p><p>The plea now exposes President Biden’s son to a likely outcome that seemed unthinkable last year, when his lawyers were on the cusp of a no-prison plea agreement: significant time behind bars. He now faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 17 years or a fine of up to $1.3 million, on top of the possible sentence of 25 years after being convicted of lying on a firearms application in Delaware in June.</p><p>It does not appear, at least for now, that he is banking on a parental executive reprieve. As Hunter Biden’s team appeared in court, listening while every word of his 56-page criminal indictment was read back to him, the White House press secretary told reporters on Air Force One, “It’s still very much a no,” when asked if the president planned to pardon his son.</p><p>“I went to trial in Delaware not realizing the anguish it would cause my family, and I will not put them through it again,” Mr. Biden said in a statement in which he accused prosecutors of “dehumanizing” him.</p><p>“There was only one path left for me,” he added. “I will not subject my family to more pain, more invasions of privacy and needless embarrassment. For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this, and so I have decided to plead guilty.”</p><p>The guilty plea came a few hours after Mr. Biden’s lawyers made a more conditional offer — a so-called <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/alford_plea#:~:text=An%20Alford%20plea%2C%20also%20known,innocence%20toward%20those%20same%20charges." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alford plea</a> — in which he acknowledged there was enough evidence to convict him even as he professed innocence toward the same charges. But that did not work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His team changed course after prosecutors said they would oppose any plea in which Mr. Biden did not accept unconditional guilt, and Judge Scarsi suggested he was inclined to move forward with the case, and to begin questioning 120 potential jurors.</p><p>That never happened.</p><p>“Enough is enough,” Abbe Lowell, one of Mr. Biden’s lawyers, said by midafternoon. “It’s time to move on.”</p><p>Mr. Biden and his backers believe that David C. Weiss, the special counsel in the case, refused to engage in serious plea negotiations out of political self-preservation. Mr. Weiss was sharply criticized for signing a generous <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/us/politics/inside-hunter-biden-plea-deal.html" title="">agreement with Mr. Biden in early 2023</a> that would have resulted in no prison time.</p><p>That agreement imploded during a chaotic hearing at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, Del., that July. Mr. Weiss subsequently indicted Mr. Biden on charges of lying on a firearms application in Delaware and on a range of tax violations in California, where he now lives.</p><p>The atmosphere in the courtroom in sunny Los Angeles on Thursday was tense, clamorous and chaotic.</p><p>Leo J. Wise, the hard-driving deputy assigned to the Weiss team after the deal collapsed, said he was stunned when the Biden team interrupted the first day of jury selection with an offer to end the trial on their terms. And he took offense when Mr. Lowell suggested that the government had subjected his client to an unfair prosecution influenced by external political pressures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This idea that he’s a victim of this process, it’s offensive,” Mr. Wise said. “We have not exacted a pound of flesh or a drop of blood. We have afforded him the same right as any American.”</p><p>Yet much of the legal drama had already been drained of its national significance. Mr. Biden’s trial on tax charges went from a central election-year saga to a political afterthought the moment President Biden withdrew from the 2024 race in July.</p><p>House Republicans had once seen Mr. Biden’s legal troubles as a political asset. But their exhaustive attempts to prove that the son and the father conspired to create a “Biden crime family” never bore fruit, and prosecutors have made it clear that they found no evidence of official wrongdoing by President Biden when he was vice president.</p><p>But the personal stakes have never been higher for his son — a first-time offender who is likely to make the case for the lightest permissible sentence, probation instead of prison time, after pleading guilty to evading a tax assessment, failing to file and pay taxes, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return.</p><p>In doing so, Mr. Biden’s legal team will argue that he has been clean and sober for five years, paid all of his back taxes and penalties and has expressed contrition to his family and associates for his drug-fueled behavior.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>People close to Mr. Biden say he has been seeking a way out of the tax trial for weeks in hopes of avoiding a reprise of the weeklong gun case, which included testimony from his former romantic partners, including the widow of his brother Beau.</p><p>Mr. Wise had signaled his intention to call many of the same witnesses in Los Angeles in court filings — and Mr. Biden was said to be particularly concerned about the possibility that his daughters Naomi and Maisy would be called to testify.</p><p>That, in turn, gave prosecutors enormous leverage, and scant incentive to offer anything in return for a guilty plea.</p><p>For the firearms trial in June, the gallery of the courtroom in the Bidens’ hometown, Wilmington, Del., was crammed with relatives including the first lady, Jill Biden. On Thursday, in Los Angeles, only Mr. Biden’s wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, along with his friend and benefactor Kevin Morris, were present.</p><p>“Do you agree you committed every element of every crime?” Judge Scarsi asked at the end of the first and last day of the proceedings, as Mr. Biden’s wife craned forward in the first row of the gallery.</p><p>“Yes,” Mr. Biden said.</p><p>A few minutes later the couple walked, hand in hand, to a waiting S.U.V. in front of the courthouse, ignoring questions hurled by reporters and onlookers.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Sept. 5, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated how long ago Hunter Biden’s gun trial in Delaware took place.
