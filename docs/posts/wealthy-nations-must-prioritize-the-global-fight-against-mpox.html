In response, wealthy nations must do everything possible to stop the disease’s spread.</p><p>Mpox, formerly known as the monkeypox virus, made the news in 2022 when a global outbreak, including in the United States, prompted a public health emergency. But by May 2023, cases in wealthy nations had receded, largely because of vaccination drives and behavior change among those most at risk of contracting the virus. The W.H.O. ended that mpox emergency.</p><p>But the virus hadn’t disappeared, and it’s now back on the rise, potentially with a vengeance.</p><p>The mpox virus has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/health/cdc-mpox-congo.html" title="">two types</a>: a much deadlier Clade I and a less severe Clade II. In 2022, the United States experienced an outbreak of Clade II. But lacking support for eradication efforts, including vaccination drives, Clade II simmered in African countries. Worse, Clade I — <a href="https://healthpolicy-watch.news/who-weighs-new-mpox-emergency-as-outbreak-escapes-drc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated to have a 3 percent to 6 percent fatality rate</a> — also spread, though it was confined to the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite all the global attention heaped on this disease at the time, African countries never received enough vaccines or sufficient support to eradicate the virus.</p><p>Now, Clade I cases are sharply on the rise in Congo, where the disease has claimed the lives more than a thousand people, most of them <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20240812_mpox_external-sitrep_35.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">children</a>. It has reached <a href="https://healthpolicy-watch.news/who-weighs-new-mpox-emergency-as-outbreak-escapes-drc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more urban areas</a>. Cases have begun to pop up in other African countries, including Burundi, Kenya and Uganda.</p><p>So far, wealthy nations have failed to send enough vaccines to counter the disease’s quick spread. The African Union’s health agency Africa C.D.C. has said it <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/africacdc_vaccinessavelives-activity-7227976484634673152-M5Pc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has only about 200,000 mpox</a> vaccine doses available out of the 10 million needed. The global vaccine alliance GAVI <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-authorities-approve-mpox-vaccines-try-contain-outbreak-2024-06-26/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Reuters</a> it needs $84 million to respond in areas at most risk, but it has raised only $8 million.</p><p>But providing vaccines alone is not enough. In Congo, stigma, regulatory obstacles and other crises — including measles and cholera outbreaks — have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/stigma-regulatory-barriers-delay-mpox-response-country-that-needs-it-most-2023-12-05/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a coordinated response</a> difficult. The country finally approved two mpox vaccines just a few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-authorities-approve-mpox-vaccines-try-contain-outbreak-2024-06-26/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a>, but it has only about 65,000 vaccines available in the short term (for a population of about 100 million people) and vaccination <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mpox-vaccines-likely-months-away-even-who-africa-cdc-discuss-emergency-2024-08-14/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaigns appear unlikely to begin before October.</a> Comprehensive international support may be the only thing that could beat back the disease.</p><p>Will we get it right this time around? If not, the United States and the rest of the world may get an unfortunate shot at a Round 2 of the virus too, perhaps in its much deadlier form.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Q5MWZhZWE0LTc2OGMtNWY0NC1hYmY4LTk4ZGU5N2JiNWNlMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#harris-democracy-ballot" data-source-id="100000009629046"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-alter"><img alt="Jonathan Alter" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-14T16:25:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 14, 2024, 12:25 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Kamala Harris is running an artful campaign so far, thanks in part to her upbeat, hopeful message. She has shrewdly positioned herself as the change candidate — no small feat for a sitting vice president — and has tagged Donald Trump as representing the weird past we should leave behind.</p><p>In her often joyful stump speech, Harris talks more about freedom than about threats to democracy. That makes strategic sense. Polls show that voters are more concerned with specific issues than about the specter of authoritarian government. But going too far in this direction risks letting some of the terrifying stakes move to the periphery of the campaign. Defending democracy was a potent issue for Democrats in avoiding a red wave in 2022, and it should remain a critical part of their argument.</p><p>It’s smart to make fun of Trump and treat him like a loser, which gets inside his head and causes more unforced errors. But jibes about his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/us/politics/trump-helicopter-willie-brown.html" title="">Willie Brown helicopter fantasies</a> and crowd size nonsense should be matched with reminders that Trump inspires violence (including the attack on Paul Pelosi and Trump’s vile jokes about it), has promised to be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-dictator-authoritarian-presidential-election-f27e7e9d7c13fabbe3ae7dd7f1235c72" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“a dictator” on his first day</a> and proposed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/us/politics/trump-constitution-republicans.html" title="">“termination” of the Constitution.</a></p><p>Democrats shouldn’t forget to emphasize that Trump said Russia could “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-nato-foreign-aid-russia-2b8054a9fe185eec34c2c541cece655d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">do whatever the hell they want</a>” to NATO countries that displeased him, a position that, as his own former aides say, could cause a world war.</p><p>While these arguments will not sway hard-core MAGA supporters, there are still plenty of undecided voters and Trump leaners who might yet be persuaded to consider Harris or at least stay home instead of reluctantly voting for Trump and JD Vance. Many have a little Liz Cheney in them that can be brought to the surface with a reasonable conversation.</p><p>So ask your uncle Bob: Would you like to see violent Jan. 6 protesters pardoned and the Jan. 6 Choir perform at Trump’s inauguration? Do you think the three living former Republican vice presidents — Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and Mike Pence — were wrong to stay away from the Republican convention?</p><p>Meanwhile, a little naming and shaming wouldn’t hurt, including making sure the members of the Georgia Election Board who advocate Election Day chaos — and the more than 70 other election officials around the country who have said they would not certify the results if Harris won — hear from the other side. While almost no Fortune 500 chief executives are endorsing the Republican nominee (a big change from the past), Elon Musk and Steve Schwarzman are among those backing Trump. As they and too many others fail the character test of their generation, it’s up to the rest of us to call them out on it.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE3YzRjMTIyLTMyMTItNWFjYS05MDAxLWMxNTQ5ZWY2ZTBjNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#democrats-civil-war-anthems" data-source-id="100000009627884"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/parker-richards"><img alt="Parker Richards" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/22/opinion/parker-richards/parker-richards-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/22/opinion/parker-richards/parker-richards-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/22/opinion/parker-richards/parker-richards-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-14T09:03:45.133Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 14, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Ribar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Kamala Harris campaign has adopted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FWF9375hUA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a song</a> by the recording artist Beyoncé (who has recently seen <a href="https://people.com/music/beyonce-28-grammys-what-they-are-for/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some mainstream success</a>) as its main musical anthem. But it shouldn’t stop there. The campaign could also go back in time and fully embrace a previous century’s patriotic musical heritage in a way that could unite progressives.</p><p>The right has recently seemed almost averse to a pre-eminent American flag, preferring <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2018/07/a-flag-for-trumps-america/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">corruptions</a> like the so-called thin blue line flag. That provides an opportunity for liberals and progressives to reclaim the country’s iconography, and the next step is to remold and proudly sing the songs of the Civil War-era Union.</p><p>Crushing the breakaway slaveholding terror state known as the Confederacy — a nightmare built on America’s worst impulses — is among this country’s proudest moments. The music celebrating that victory is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gys-cgjkRt0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beautiful</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZOlZs0u1_Y" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patriotic</a> — and already known to many Americans.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAFEWL0-1sc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">While We Were Marching Through Georgia</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhSzuhdIkuE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union Dixie</a>” might be a stretch too far for the Harris campaign (though what could be more unifying, really, than bringing traitors back into the fold?), but “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW4ZwyYJYbQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Battle Cry of Freedom</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4N2lIFKWgc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>” are surely fitting.</p><p>“The Battle Hymn” is particularly evocative. Its lyrics, written by Julia Ward Howe <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1862/02/the-battle-hymn-of-the-republic/308052/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in the midst</a> of the Civil War, evoke peace and war alongside each other. The goal of a peaceful country, embracing equality as its purpose, goes hand in hand with its willingness to fight for that outcome: The “righteous sentence” can be enacted only by willingness to fight for it and to “make men free”; to that end, America’s musicians must “never call retreat.”</p><p>The song expresses a martial Christianity, an understanding that slavery was a sin and that it must be cleansed, by flame and sword and through a war comparable in its moral scope to the Crucifixion itself. It presents a redemptive, just vision of Christianity, one that — unlike the exclusionary narrative advanced by Christian nationalists — seeks to use one faith tradition as a way to uplift rather than to repress.</p><p>And the Harris campaign seems to know this: At a rally in Eau Claire, Wis., this month, the folk band Bon Iver performed “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moX5gJA5cok" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Battle Cry of Freedom</a>.” Surrounded by red, white and blue bunting, flags flying above, it presented an unabashedly patriotic vision of American liberalism writ large. It’s an image with appeal across party lines, like Abraham Lincoln’s 1864 “National Union” electoral alliance, which combined Republicans, Democrats and Unconditional Unionists into one bloc to support the continued war against slavery and secessionism.</p><p>Music has power. It can convey ideological messages, appeal to a mass audience and carry through lines in politics across decades or even centuries better than any other form. As the Jacobite movement of the 18th century <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c941b9101232c6f71231ed1/t/66bb9244badc5050c107bf03/1723568709063/prichards_version_3+%282%29.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used its songcraft</a> to carry a proscribed ideology to a mass audience, Harris and her party have a unique opportunity to use America’s auditory history to build the iconography of a 21st-century political movement. They should seize it — as they trample out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M2YWYwNzFlLTExOWYtNWM4Yi1iYzE1LTA1NjFhYjEwZDBkOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#jordan-chiles-bronze-medal" data-source-id="100000009627955"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liriel-higa"><img alt="Liriel Higa" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-13T22:47:43.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 13, 2024, 6:47 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>What has become the most notable epic fail of the Paris Olympics began with heartbreak. Ana Barbosu, a Romanian gymnast, appeared to place third in the floor event finals of the artistic gymnastics competition and prematurely celebrated her victory. Moments later, she wept as another gymnast moved into bronze medal position.</p><p>Jordan Chiles, Barbosu’s American competitor, initially appeared to place fifth in the competition. But after an inquiry by her coach, the judges agreed that Chiles deserved full credit for a leap they hadn’t scored and bumped her up to third place, above Barbosu and another Romanian gymnast, Sabrina Maneca-Voinea. The two Romanians had, in fact, received the same overall score, but in a tiebreaker, Barbosu was ranked higher based on her higher execution score.</p><p>The online backlash against Chiles’s bronze medal win was immediate, intense and unwarranted. But the slipshod nature of what has become a seemingly endless saga of inquiries and international rulings has cast a shadow over what should have been the sporting career highlight for three tremendous gymnasts.</p><p>The Romanian Gymnastics Federation appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an international body that settles disputes in international sporting competitions. It ruled that Chiles’s coach’s inquiry had come four seconds too late, voiding her appeal and revised score. The panel <a href="https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Media_Release_ParisOG_15-16.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">then ruled</a> that the International Gymnastics Federation should determine the final ranking of the gymnasts. The federation subsequently passed the decision on to the International Olympic Committee, which has stripped Chiles of her bronze.</p><p>There are additional complicating factors in this murky moral mess, including whether Chiles’s coach had in fact <a href="https://x.com/USAGym/status/1822724122951991331" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted the inquiry too late</a> or whether Maneca-Voinea, the other Romanian, should not have received an out-of-bounds deduction that lowered her score. (Video replays showed that she did not step out of bounds.) If the judges had awarded Chiles full credit for her leap and more accurately scored Maneca-Voinea, then Maneca-Voinea would have finished third, Chiles fourth and Barbosu fifth.</p><p>There’s also a timeliness factor: If the Chiles inquiry was, in fact, too late, then it should not have been accepted. But it was accepted, and now the International Olympic Committee has decided to take back a bronze medal days after it was awarded, a<strong> </strong>dishonor usually reserved for athletes who have doped.</p><p>The Romanian Gymnastics Federation has proposed a solution that would ameliorate the mistakes made by officials that make sense: rank all three gymnasts third and give them all bronze medals. There is precedent for awarding duplicate medals (albeit in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/16/sports/olympics-figure-skating-canadian-skaters-awarded-share-olympic-gold-french-judge.html" title="">figure skating</a>), and such a move would duly acknowledge that these three gymnasts were failed more by their judges than their own skill.</p><p>For sports like gymnastics, which are arbitrated by judges instead of, say, the click of a finish line camera, crediting gymnasts with the appropriate difficulty levels and accurately determining whether they stayed in bounds is crucial for the sport to function fairly. Given the incompetence of these officials, awarding each of these athletes a medal would be the most just outcome.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE4ODJjNTZiLWIzYjMtNTAzOS1iNmYzLTIzNmFlZGNlZDZhOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#krugman-inflation-bacon-trump" data-source-id="100000009626838"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman"><img alt="Paul Krugman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-13T14:18:20.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 13, 2024, 10:18 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The data keep telling us that inflation is basically over as a problem.</p><p>On Tuesday morning we got the latest report on <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">producer prices</a>, and it was “soft.” That’s a good indicator for the much more widely watched Consumer Price Index, which we’ll get Wednesday.

The key issue is that these images muddy the waters of credibility for everyone while providing a handy excuse for political operatives willing to lie to their supporters already eager to believe the lie.</p><p>Take Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/us/politics/trump-harris-crowds-ai.html" title="">social media post</a> on Sunday in which he accused Kamala Harris’s campaign of manipulating an image to make her crowd seem bigger at a Detroit airplane hangar last week.</p><p>“Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?” he wrote. “There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!”</p><p>How do we know an image is real in this day and age? An average person can no longer be certain of the authenticity of images or, increasingly, even videos through individual sleuthing. The A.I. is that good and is getting better. (That’s why the classic media literacy advice — do your own research — doesn’t work anymore.)</p><p>This makes it difficult to know what to believe, except through a key mechanism: trusting sources and trusting that they have either taken the image or video themselves or carefully vetted it as authentic.</p><p>That’s how we know that the crowd waiting for Harris was real, because there are pictures from photo agencies like Getty, as well as images and reports from multiple other news organizations that were on the tarmac, that match the circulating social media photos that caught Trump’s ire. We know that credible news organizations and photo agencies have very strict rules about images and videos. But that, in turn, requires trusting the photo agency or other media source furnishing the image or video.</p><p>It’s no accident that Trump has made it a habit to portray credible news organizations as untrustworthy liars, and many of his supporters seem to have internalized that message they were open to in the first place.</p><p>Once trust is lost and all credibility is questioned, the lie doesn’t have to be high quality. It doesn’t have to be supported by highly realistic fake A.I. It doesn’t have to be so easily disprovable. To work, the lie just needs a willing purveyor and an eager audience. The A.I., then, is but a fig leaf.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMzYWVkNDAyLWQxYTItNThkOC1hYTE1LWE0YzM0ZjljNTZiMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#olympics-most-successful-nation" data-source-id="100000009624807"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-coy"><img alt="Peter Coy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-12T15:06:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 12, 2024, 11:06 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>China and the United States tied for gold medals at 40 apiece, and the United States had more medals overall, but the most successful nation at the Paris Olympics was Australia. France was second, followed by Britain and the Netherlands, with the United States coming in fifth and China 89th.</p><p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.olympicnationalrankings.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new ranking method</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/opinion/paris-olympics-medals-winner.html" title="">I wrote about</a> ahead of the Games. Its inventors, Robert Duncan and Andrew Parece, wanted a method that wouldn’t overly favor the most-populous nations, but also wouldn’t give the top ranking every four years to a small country that gets a medal or two. (This year Grenada, with two medals, had the most per capita, followed by Dominica and St. Lucia.)</p><p>Australia tends to do well by their method. It also came out on top in the Tokyo Games. (It bears repeating, of course, that there is no official national winner, because the Games are a competition among athletes, not countries.)</p><p>The Duncan-Parece method ranks countries according to how improbable their medal counts are, on the assumption that all medal-winning nations have an equal propensity per capita for winning medals.</p><p>As they wrote in their paper on the subject: “We simply ask: how probable is it, in this idealization, for a given high-performing country (with a given population) to have won as many medals as it actually did, or more medals?”</p><p>Their <a href="https://byjus.com/binomial-distribution-formula/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measure of improbability</a> is the one you would use to calculate the likelihood of flipping heads, say, 10 times in a row.</p><p>There seems to be growing interest in the subject. Duncan emailed me on Sunday to say that people from 153 countries had visited their website, <a href="https://www.olympicnationalrankings.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">olympicnationalrankings.com</a>.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhjMTJkYzg0LTE3ZWQtNWIxNS04OTQ5LTViOGUyYjdiMzczZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#tipsheet-harris-trump-define" data-source-id="100000009624153"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-12T09:05:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 12, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we kick off the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign.

Kamala Harris has not yet released information about upcoming events but did say over the weekend that her campaign would release an economic policy proposal this week.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Everything changes so fast right now that taking stock of the race can feel like an ephemeral pursuit, but in a series of polls, including the New York Times/Siena poll, Harris has either pulled even with Trump or has moved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/harris-trump-battleground-polls.html" title="">ahead</a> in some places.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>At the very least, the campaign has been reset to a toss-up, compared with the anemic state of President Biden’s polling against Trump. Nate Cohn of The Times observed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1822240430131495021" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sharp thread</a> on Twitter over the weekend that people’s perception of Harris wasn’t totally stable — it’s changed in the last few weeks as she’s become more popular, and could change again. But, he added, “at least for now, we’re getting a reminder of what happens when the Democrats nominate a broadly acceptable candidate against Trump and his allies: They do pretty well.”</p></li><li><p>Harris is known to people, but is also totally new as a candidate. One place that the idea of Harris is being shaped for people, especially in battlegrounds, is on TV and in digital advertising. The first weekend of the Olympics, I was in A Battleground State for the weekend, and could see it in real time: It felt as if each commercial break alternated between “Kamala Harris is good” and “Kamala Harris is bad.”</p><p>The emphasis in the negative advertising was on the <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1821164625313898886/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">border</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1818261358502096905/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially</a>.</p></li></ul><div><div><blockquote data-cards=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pro-Trump group MAGA Inc. is up on TV with this spot --</p>— Medium Buying (@MediumBuying) <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1821164625313898886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
