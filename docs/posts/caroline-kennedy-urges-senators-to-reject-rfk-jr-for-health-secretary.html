    <h1>Caroline Kennedy Urges Senators to Reject RFK Jr. for Health Secretary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Caroline Kennedy wrote a letter to key senators on Tuesday, calling her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a “predator” who is addicted to the attention he gets from airing dangerous views on vaccinations.</p><p>She called on lawmakers, who will be questioning Mr. Kennedy at his confirmation hearings to become the nation’s health secretary on Wednesday and Thursday, to reject his nomination. She cited his lack of experience, misinformed views on vaccines and personal attributes. In the letter, she described how he led other families members “down the path of drug addiction.”</p><p>“His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks,” Ms. Kennedy wrote. “It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.”</p><p>Her letter was first reported in The Washington Post.</p><p>She gave him credit for overcoming his drug addiction, which Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/kennedy-rfk-profile-trump.html" title="">has discussed extensively</a>, but she said that the collateral damage was extensive.</p></div></div>
