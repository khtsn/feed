At several public events, the Republican candidate has vowed to end the war quickly, even if that means having Ukraine cede large swaths of territory to Russia.</p><p>“Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now,” Mr. Trump said during a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also long been skeptical about providing financial and military aid to Ukraine, saying that the contributions were draining American resources, a stance that the Republican Party has largely echoed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers firing toward Russian positions in the Pokrovsk region of eastern Ukraine this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Yet some Ukrainian analysts say that Mr. Trump is a wild card when it comes to foreign policy, and that his potential return would not necessarily be bad news for Ukraine.</p><p>“There is a certain level of unpredictability about Trump,” Sergiy Solodkyy, the first deputy director of the New Europe Center, a Kyiv-based foreign policy think tank, said in an interview this summer. “He may say something publicly and act differently when he’s in power.”</p><p>Mr. Solodkyy noted that after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, Mr. Trump reversed President Barack Obama’s policy of not providing weapons to Ukraine. He also approved a decision to send Javelin antitank missiles to Ukraine, which proved useful at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in early 2022.</p><p>He also pointed out that Mr. Trump soft-pedaled his opposition to additional American aid to Ukraine earlier this year, prompting some Republican members of Congress to vote in favor of the military package after months of holding back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Analysts say Ukraine has been developing strategies to appeal to Mr. Trump’s key stated interests, such as shoring up the American economy.</p><p>Oleksandr Kraeiv, the head of the North America Program at Ukrainian Prism, a research institute, said that emphasizing the economic benefits for American arms manufacturers could resonate with Mr. Trump.</p><p>“We need to be practical and less ideologized,” Mr. Kraeiv said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
