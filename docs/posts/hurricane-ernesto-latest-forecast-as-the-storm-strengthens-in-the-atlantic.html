Ernesto is expected to continue strengthening this week, and could become a major hurricane by Friday, according to the National Weather Service.</p></li><li><p>A hurricane watch was issued for Bermuda, where hurricane conditions are possible by Saturday, the Weather Service said. The storm is not expected to approach the mainland United States, but forecasters warned it could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast by Thursday.</p></li><li><p>President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/08/13/president-joseph-r-biden-jr-approves-puerto-rico-emergency-declaration-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved</a> a declaration of emergency in Puerto Rico, where nearly half of the customers served by the island’s utility <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/puerto-rico-power-hurricane-ernesto.html" title="">were without power</a> Wednesday. The power was also out for parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p></li></ul><p>Puerto Rico was bracing for up to 10 inches of rain in some areas, and power outages had been expected, given the island’s frail electrical grid. On Wednesday evening, Luma Energy, which transmits and distributes electricity in the territory, was reporting that more than 718,000 customers were still without power there.</p><p>Daryl Jaschen, the emergency management director for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are east of Puerto Rico, said in a briefing late on Wednesday morning that the power was out across the entirety of St. John and St. Croix. There was some power being generated in St. Thomas, he said.</p></div></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="five-map-path-embed" data-id="100000009624251" data-source-id="100000009624251"><div data-sourceid="100000009624251" id="embed-id-100000009624251">

It carved a path of destruction through the Caribbean before crossing into the Gulf of Mexico and hitting the Texas coast.</p><p>Earlier this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration continued its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/climate/noaa-hurricane-forecast.html" title="">forecast of 17 to 24 named storms this year</a>,<strong> </strong>an “above-normal” number and a prediction in line with more than a dozen forecasts earlier in the year from experts at universities, private companies and government agencies. Hurricane seasons produce 14 named storms on average from June 1 through Nov. 30.</p><p>The seasonal hurricane outlooks were notably aggressive because forecasters looking at the start of the season saw a combination of circumstances that didn’t exist in records dating back to the mid-1800s: record warm water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and the potential formation of the weather pattern known as La Niña.</p></div></div><div><div><p>La Niña occurs in the Pacific because of changing ocean temperatures, and it affects weather patterns globally. When it is strong, it typically provides a calm environment in the Atlantic; this allows storms to develop more easily and to strengthen without interference from wind patterns that might otherwise keep them from organizing.</p><p>Patricia Mazzei<!-- -->, <!-- -->Camille Baker<!-- --> and <!-- -->John Yoon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
