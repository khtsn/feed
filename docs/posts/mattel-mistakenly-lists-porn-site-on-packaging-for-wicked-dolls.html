The company said it had intended to direct consumers to <a href="https://www.wickedmovie.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the movie’s landing page</a>, not to a URL for a website restricted to people 18 years of age and older.</p><p>The doll is for children four and up.</p><p>Mattel expressed deep regret, blamed the mix-up on an “unfortunate error” and vowed to take “immediate action.” But the company did not say how the error had occurred or what action it planned to take.</p><p>It was not immediately clear early Monday how many of the mislabeled boxes had been distributed to stores. Mattel had not announced a recall or offered a refund to affected customers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The film, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, is scheduled for release on Nov. 22. Universal Pictures, its distributor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A doll from the ‘Wicked’ toy collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mattel</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mattel isn’t the first company or public figure to publicly confuse one URL with another.</p><p>Last week, Pope Francis appeared to paint himself as a New Orleans Saints fan by <a href="https://x.com/Pontifex/status/1853776782471631129" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeatedly using a hashtag</a> that refers to the football team, not to the venerated disciples of the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>“We cannot become #Saints with a frown,” he <a href="https://x.com/Pontifex/status/1854501558148268499" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>. “We must have joyful hearts to remain open to hope.”</p><p>When the Saints <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5911901/2024/11/10/falcons-saints-score-takeaways-result/" title="">beat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday</a>, breaking a seven-game losing streak, some of their fans saw the win as divine providence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The worlds of politics and media have seen their share of URL fumbles, too.</p><p>In 2019, an Italian cartoonist known as Albo, whose work includes erotic images, said on Twitter that hundreds of people had mistaken him for Anthony Albanese, an Australian politician who was campaigning to be leader of the country’s Labor Party.</p><p>Mr. Albanese won that election and is now prime minister. But he is still occasionally mistaken for Albo.</p><p>In April, for example, Michael Rowland, a presenter for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, <a href="https://x.com/mjrowland68/status/1782521959366181179" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apologized</a> after he <a href="https://x.com/mjrowland68/status/1782516524412223529" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mistakenly attributed a comment</a> about Elon Musk to the artist instead of to Mr. Albanese.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
