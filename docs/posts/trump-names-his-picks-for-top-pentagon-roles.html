    <h1>Trump Names His Picks for Top Pentagon Roles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Colby, whose grandfather William Colby served as C.I.A. director under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/article/1230279/elbridge-a-colby/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">served in the Pentagon</a> during the first Trump administration. In October, he said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/opinion/trump-foreign-policy-republicans.html" title="">in an interview</a> with a Times opinion writer that China presented the greatest military threat to the United States, and he praised Mr. Trump for what he called a “mix of flexibility and pragmatism” for his willingness to negotiate with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.</p><p>Regarding Ukraine, Mr. Colby said the country needed sufficient arms for its war with Russia, adding that he would support “an intensification of sanctions” against Moscow. He also said he did not believe that Ukraine should become a member of NATO.</p><p>Mr. Duffey served in the Office of Management and Budget in the first Trump administration and was at the center of a major episode. It was Mr. Duffey who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/us/politics/white-house-pentagon-ukraine-aid.html" title="">asked the Pentagon to freeze $250 million in scheduled military aid to Kyiv</a> after a phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/trump-ukraine-whistleblower.html" title="">in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joseph R. Biden Jr</a>. That call between the two presidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html" title="">led to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment</a>.</p><p>Mr. Michael served as an executive at the ride-sharing company Uber, where he <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/emil-michael-of-uber-proposes-digging-into-journalists-private-lives/" title="">supported hiring investigators to pursue journalists</a> who wrote articles critical of the company. He left Uber in 2017 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/uber-travis-kalanick-emil-michael.html" title="">after a report that he had visited an escort bar in South Korea as part of a business trip</a>, which made some co-workers uncomfortable and led to a complaint to the company’s human resources department.</p><p>Mr. Michael is not Mr. Trump’s only prospective defense nominee with a cloud of scandal hanging over him. Mr. Trump’s choice for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/police-report-sexual-assault-claim-hegseth.html" title="">accused of sexual assault</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/pete-hegseth-workplace.html" title="">alcohol abuse and mismanagement of a nonprofit</a>. He has denied the accusations. Mr. Hegseth has also vocally defended war criminals and spoken out about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-defense-pete-hegseth.html" title="">his opposition to women serving in combat roles in the U.S. military</a>, even though a number of women have qualified in nearly all combat jobs the Pentagon has to offer since a policy banning women from those roles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/us/politics/combat-military-women-ash-carter.html" title="">was lifted in 2015</a>.</p></div></div>
