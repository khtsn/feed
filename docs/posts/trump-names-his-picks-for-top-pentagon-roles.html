Trump plans to nominate four men for top leadership roles at the Pentagon, including two who served in his first administration, he announced on social media on Sunday.</p><p>Mr. Trump named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/stephen-a-feinberg" title="">Stephen A. Feinberg</a> as his choice for deputy secretary of defense, <a href="https://themarathoninitiative.org/elbridge-colby/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elbridge Colby</a> to be under secretary for policy, Michael Duffey for under secretary for acquisitions and sustainment and Emil Michael as under secretary for research and engineering. All should face Senate confirmation hearings.</p><p>Mr. Feinberg, the billionaire co-founder of the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, was a major funder of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaigns and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/stephen-feinberg-trump-intelligence.html" title="">considered for a top intelligence post</a> in the first Trump administration.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/01/magazine/remington-guns-jobs-huntsville.html" title="">firearms enthusiast</a>, he invested in businesses that were in bad shape financially, including Cerberus’s 2007 acquisition of the gun maker Remington, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/remington-bankruptcy-guns.html" title="">declared bankruptcy in 2018 and again in 2020</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Colby, whose grandfather William Colby served as C.I.A. director under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/article/1230279/elbridge-a-colby/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">served in the Pentagon</a> during the first Trump administration. In October, he said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/opinion/trump-foreign-policy-republicans.html" title="">in an interview</a> with a Times opinion writer that China presented the greatest military threat to the United States, and he praised Mr. Trump for what he called a “mix of flexibility and pragmatism” for his willingness to negotiate with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.</p><p>Regarding Ukraine, Mr. Colby said the country needed sufficient arms for its war with Russia, adding that he would support “an intensification of sanctions” against Moscow. He also said he did not believe that Ukraine should become a member of NATO.</p><p>Mr. Duffey served in the Office of Management and Budget in the first Trump administration and was at the center of a major episode. It was Mr. Duffey who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/us/politics/white-house-pentagon-ukraine-aid.html" title="">asked the Pentagon to freeze $250 million in scheduled military aid to Kyiv</a> after a phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/trump-ukraine-whistleblower.html" title="">in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joseph R. Biden Jr</a>. That call between the two presidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html" title="">led to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment</a>.</p><p>Mr. Michael served as an executive at the ride-sharing company Uber, where he <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/emil-michael-of-uber-proposes-digging-into-journalists-private-lives/" title="">supported hiring investigators to pursue journalists</a> who wrote articles critical of the company. He left Uber in 2017 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/technology/uber-travis-kalanick-emil-michael.html" title="">after a report that he had visited an escort bar in South Korea as part of a business trip</a>, which made some co-workers uncomfortable and led to a complaint to the company’s human resources department.</p><p>Mr. Michael is not Mr. Trump’s only prospective defense nominee with a cloud of scandal hanging over him. Mr. Trump’s choice for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/police-report-sexual-assault-claim-hegseth.html" title="">accused of sexual assault</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/pete-hegseth-workplace.html" title="">alcohol abuse and mismanagement of a nonprofit</a>. He has denied the accusations. Mr. Hegseth has also vocally defended war criminals and spoken out about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-defense-pete-hegseth.html" title="">his opposition to women serving in combat roles in the U.S. military</a>, even though a number of women have qualified in nearly all combat jobs the Pentagon has to offer since a policy banning women from those roles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/us/politics/combat-military-women-ash-carter.html" title="">was lifted in 2015</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The once-tenuous candidacy of Mr. Hegseth, a former major in the Army National Guard and a weekend host of “Fox &amp; Friends,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/pete-hegseth-trump-defense-secretary.html" title="">appears more plausible after he secured the support</a> of some key senators in recent weeks.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Ismay is a reporter covering the Pentagon for The Times.
