They also gain broader protections against unlawful termination or forms of exploitation by an employer. And the law bars anyone who has been convicted of rape, homicide, trafficking and other violent offenses from employing sex workers.</p><p>“The law responds directly to what sexual exploitation often looks like in practice,” Ms. Kilbride said, adding, “The list of rights and freedoms it affords sex workers are refreshingly practical and long overdue.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The window, right, of a sex worker’s booth in Antwerp, Belgium, in 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Virginia Mayo/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ms. Kilbride described Belgian law as more expansive and more worker-centric than those in other countries where sex work is also legal. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Still, many of the most vulnerable sex workers are not eligible for contracts, perhaps because they do not have legal residency status. They will not be able to access all of the protections available to contracted workers under the law.</p><p>And not all organizations agree with decriminalization. Isala, a Belgian organization that supports sex workers, although not their profession, condemned the law, which it described as the legalization of pimping. Isala said it normalizes sex work itself, which it calls prostitution and <a href="https://www.isalaasbl.be/prostitution-statut-salarie-exploitation-precarite-isolement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argues is exploitative</a>.</p><p>“When Isala’s volunteers meet women on the streets, the most recurrent sentences they hear are: ‘I want a normal job, a normal life’ or ‘I would not do this if I had the choice,’” Isala said in a statement, adding that the law “is entirely disconnected from the lived realities of most people involved in prostitution.”</p><p>Members of the Belgian government acknowledged that sex workers are often vulnerable or are forced into the job.</p><p>“Whilst we recognize that not all sex workers perform their activities out of their own free will, we argue that it is much more difficult to get into contact and inform sex workers about their rights when they hide their activities,” Sandrine Daoud, a spokeswoman for the Belgian health minister, wrote in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>By allowing legal sex work and giving workers protection, she wrote, “we hope to enable all sex workers who want to leave the sector to do so.”</p><p>For many sex workers, the law — which builds on the <a href="https://www.utsopi.be/our-work/decriminalisation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decriminalization</a> — is an opening to a safer way to work and more access to the formal economy. Several Belgian advocacy groups, including UTSOPI, a Belgian sex work union, pushed for and helped to design the law.</p><p>Daan Bauwens, a leader of UTSOPI, estimated that there are between 8,000 and 26,000 sex workers in the country, though he said there was no official count.</p><p>He said that before the law passed, some had to work into their 70s because they did not have a pension, and others worked through their pregnancies because their employers forced them to or they had no paid maternity leave. Others, he said, have had to pay for housing with garbage bags of cash because they could not obtain proof of income. (Sex workers have long struggled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/business/sex-workers-bank-accounts.html" title="">open bank accounts</a>.)</p><p>Now, Mr. Bauwens said, more protections are available to people who work in what some call the oldest profession in the world. People are always going to buy and sell sex, he said, so sex workers should at least get sick days and pensions, like any legal employee in Belgium.</p><p>“Sex work is not a glamorous business,” he said, which is precisely why they need access to stronger labor rights. “We are not saying it is a job as any other,” he said, “but we say that sex workers deserve protection — as any other worker.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Undersea Surgeons: </strong>In a wireless world, it is easy to forget the cables that snake across the turbulent ocean floor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/30/world/africa/subsea-cables.html">Until they snap</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mexican Cartels Turn to Students:</strong> Cartels are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/americas/mexico-fentanyl-chemistry-students.html">luring university chemistry students in Mexico</a> with big paydays in their quest to build fentanyl empires.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Sinking Arctic Hamlet:</strong> Canada is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/americas/canada-arctic-permafrost-thawing.html">losing its permafrost to climate change</a>.
