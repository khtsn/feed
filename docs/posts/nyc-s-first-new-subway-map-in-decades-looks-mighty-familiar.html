    <h1>NYC’s First New Subway Map in Decades Looks Mighty Familiar</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><header><p id="article-summary">The redesigned map of the New York City system, the first to be introduced in nearly half a century, is reminiscent of a version from the 1970s that was reviled by many traditionalists.</p><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="SUBWAY-COMBO-MAP"><div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>The new map, right, is a diagrammatic, brightly colored variation on the current version, left, that sacrifices some geographic detail for clarity.</figcaption></figure></div><p><time datetime="2025-04-02T14:29:20-04:00"><span>April 2, 2025</span><span>Updated <span>2:29 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When it comes to the New York City subway, what once was old is new again.</p><p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Wednesday revealed a revamped map of the city’s subway system that takes its cues from a 1970s throwback that was cheered by design connoisseurs and reviled by many traditionalists.</p><p>It is the first major overhaul of the subway map to be introduced by the authority in almost 50 years.</p><p>The reveal of the map, on a train platform in Times Square, was another step in the M.T.A.’s campaign to revitalize the subway’s image. The move comes at a time when the authority is lobbying for billions of dollars to upgrade the city’s mass transit system, while defending itself against criticisms from Washington about crime and congestion pricing.</p><p>The new map — a brightly colored variation on the current version that sacrifices some geographic detail for clarity — is reminiscent of the 1972 Unimark map, a modernist streamlining of the subways that rendered Central Park as a square and straightened the curvy contours of the system. The map was short lived, replaced in 1979 by a version much closer to the current one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Critics of that style <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/arts/design/the-subway-map-that-rattled-new-yorkers.html" title="">bemoaned its stark departure</a> from conventional maps. Landmarks seemed squished together. Bodies of water were beige. Tourists who misjudged the distance between stops were confounded. But fans saw an elegant solution to an increasingly complicated system.</p><p>The updated version, which blends elements of the Unimark design with a successor known as the Tauranac map — named after John Tauranac, a well-regarded New York mapmaker — is already being displayed on digital monitors, and will be posted in subway cars and platforms over the next several weeks, the M.T.A. said.</p><p>For Janno Lieber, the authority’s chairman, the occasion was also an opportunity to tie his ambitions for the system to a critical moment in its past.</p><p>“This is a linchpin moment, like in 1979, when we started to fix the subway system,” Mr. Lieber said, referring to the year before the M.T.A. debuted its first capital plan to overhaul the aging transit system. As then, the system is in dire need of new trains and infrastructure improvements. So far, the State Legislature has yet to fully fund the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/nyregion/mta-budget-congestion-pricing.html" title="">latest $68 billion plan</a>.</p><p>But the revisions to the map are more than cosmetic, said Shanifah Rieara, the authority’s chief customer officer. Two of the biggest alterations address complaints about the legibility of transfer points at some of the busiest hubs, as well as efforts to make the map feel “inclusive for all,” with clearer depictions of accessibility features.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Lieber declined to say how much the map overhaul cost, but said it was paid for “entirely in house,” without a stand-alone budget.</p><p>The subway system has been looking less and less like its old self. Its iconic MetroCard, in use since 1993, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/nyregion/nyc-subway-metro-card.html" title="">will be phased out</a> by the end of the year, in favor of the new digital OMNY system. Subway turnstiles are being fitted with half-moon fins and serrated barriers to deter fare evasion. Waist-high metal barriers are rising at the edge of platforms, to prevent riders from falling onto the tracks. And some station benches — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-subway-leaning-benches/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if one can call them that</a> — are getting skinnier.</p><p>The changes amount to a makeover for the aging system, which in recent weeks has been castigated by Sean Duffy, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Last month, using a vulgarity, he compared the subway with a toilet, after threatening to cut off untold funding for the M.T.A. if it did not comply with a detailed request for crime and policing stats.</p><p>The Trump administration has ordered New York to kill its congestion pricing program, a new toll for drivers in Manhattan, by mid-April. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the plan will hurt the local economy.</p><p>But Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has vowed to keep charging the toll, which is expected to raise $15 billion for long overdue upgrades to the subway, bus and regional rail systems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As a centerpiece of the M.T.A.’s recent face-lift, the new map is likely to invoke a range of responses from riders and armchair cartographers alike.</p><p>Karen Hedju, 57, a resident of Morningside Heights in Manhattan, was one of the first to lay eyes on the latest design.</p><p>“Meh,” Ms. Hedju said, as she squinted at the design on a color printout. “It looks cluttered,” she added, but explained that she didn’t have her reading glasses on.</p><p>Terence Richardson, 56, a home health care supervisor, was more enthusiastic, noting that he would be pleased to see the new maps citywide, in part because of the more detailed legend in the top-right corner.</p><p>The reveal was also a vindication of sorts for the designers of the 1970s version — more diagram than map — that split New Yorkers a generation ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The 1972 Unimark map, created by the designers Massimo Vignelli and Bob Noorda and a team including Joan Charysyn, was a major departure from past iterations, said Jodi Shapiro, the curator of the New York Transit Museum. Its angular style — depicting Central Park as a square, not a rectangle, and flattening the city’s diverse topography — was a bridge too far for some, she said.</p><p>For those with a more personal connection to the debate, the return was long overdue.</p><p>“Great! Finally!” said Luca Vignelli, the son of the senior Mr. Vignelli, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/business/massimo-vignelli-a-modernist-graphic-designer-dies-at-83.html" title="">who died in 2014</a>.</p><p>Mr. Vignelli, reached by phone in Italy, was working on a retrospective of his parents’ work that will run in Milan and showcase the 1972 map.</p><p>“I wish he was around to enjoy it,” he said.</p><p>Sean Piccoli<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>In the Ring, His Parents’ Money Doesn’t Matter:</strong> Sean O’Bradaigh grew up in a world of Manhattan privilege, but private schools and ski vacations have nothing on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/in-the-ring-it-doesnt-matter-how-much-money-his-parents-have.html">dream of being a professional boxer</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The ‘Subway Ninja’:</strong> In the lowest moment of Selwyn Bernardez’s life, he attacked a stranger with a sword.
