The move comes at a time when the authority is lobbying for billions of dollars to upgrade the city’s mass transit system, while defending itself against criticisms from Washington about crime and congestion pricing.</p><p>The new map — a brightly colored variation on the current version that sacrifices some geographic detail for clarity — is reminiscent of the 1972 Unimark map, a modernist streamlining of the subways that rendered Central Park as a square and straightened the curvy contours of the system. The map was short-lived, replaced in 1979 by a version much closer to the current one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The updated version is already being displayed on digital monitors, and will be posted in subway cars and platforms over the next several weeks, the M.T.A. said.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p><p>Sean Piccoli<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
