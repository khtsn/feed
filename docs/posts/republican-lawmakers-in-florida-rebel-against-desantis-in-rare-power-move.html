Ron DeSantis of Florida could count on Republican state lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/05/us/ron-desantis-florida-legislature.html" title="">bending to his will</a>, giving swift approval to his ambitious legislative priorities with hardly a whiff of protest.</p><p>Those days appear to be over.</p><p>On Monday, in a remarkable sequence of events at the State Capitol in Tallahassee, Republican legislative leaders asserted their independence. They rejected Mr. DeSantis’s call for a special session on illegal immigration, called one of their own instead and, in an exceedingly rare move, overrode one of his budget vetoes.</p><p>They even aimed some public disdain his way.</p><p>“I believe special sessions should be used sparingly and should not be stunts used to generate headlines,” Daniel Perez, the new House speaker, said from the chamber floor.</p><p>Mr. Perez and Ben Albritton, the new Senate president, introduced their own immigration bill, characterizing it as a way to back President Trump on illegal immigration — much like Mr. DeSantis did when he made his own proposals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the legislators’ reproach of Mr. DeSantis was not really about immigration policy. The incoming leaders, speaking simultaneously to their respective chambers, were staging a dramatic break with a governor who, from the time he took office in 2019, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/us/politics/ron-desantis-florida-governor-power.html" title="">methodically expanded his executive powers</a> — often, it seemed, at the expense of a pliant legislature.</p><p>“Sometimes leadership isn’t about being out front on an issue,” Mr. Albritton said on the Senate floor. “It’s actually about following the leader you trust. I trust President Trump. And I trust Florida law enforcement.”</p><p>Mr. Perez and Mr. Albritton said they would not impose criminal penalties on local police officers who did not help with federal immigration enforcement, as Mr. DeSantis had wanted. They also did not agree to expand a DeSantis program that in 2022 paid to recruit and fly several dozen undocumented immigrants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/us/migrants-marthas-vineyard-desantis-texas.html" title="">to Martha’s Vineyard, in Massachusetts.</a></p><p>The leaders said that they would set aside $500 million for local agencies to assist with immigration enforcement (as Mr. DeSantis had requested), increase certain criminal penalties (though not as many as Mr. DeSantis wanted) and create a new state office to coordinate enforcement efforts (but not under Mr. DeSantis’s power).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Leaders of Mr. DeSantis’s own party had not dared to defy him so directly since his actions at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 turned the governor into a national Republican hero. Mr. DeSantis leveraged his new standing to push far-reaching proposals that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/us/politics/ron-desantis-florida-politics.html" title="">turned Florida</a> into a laboratory of right-wing policy, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/08/us/politics/desantis-wins-florida-governor.html" title="">won re-election in a rout</a> in 2022. He announced he was running for president.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I believe special sessions should be used sparingly and should not be stunts used to generate headlines,” said Daniel Perez, the new House speaker, from the chamber floor on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mishalynn Brown/Tallahassee Democrat/Usa Today Network, via Imagn </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But early last year, Mr. DeSantis’s campaign fizzled as Mr. Trump’s barreled forward. Mr. DeSantis <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/us/desantis-florida-legislature.html" title="">did not loom as large</a> over the spring legislative session. His once-close relationship with Mr. Trump was strained.</p><p>The governor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/desantis-is-going-all-out-to-defeat-floridas-abortion-ballot-question.html" title="">successfully defeated</a> a pair of state ballot initiatives in November that would have guaranteed abortion rights and legalized marijuana in Florida. But he is term-limited after 2026, and the jockeying to succeed him has begun.</p><p>On Monday, the new legislative leaders, who will preside over their chambers through the end of Mr. DeSantis’s term, seemed to be declaring their independence from a governor’s office that has wielded so much power that legislative sessions have become largely predictable rubber stamps.</p><p>Lawmakers will still focus on illegal immigration this week, as Mr. DeSantis had wanted. But Republican leaders dismissed many of the governor’s proposed policies — and outright rejected, at least for now, other changes that Mr. DeSantis was seeking, such as making it more difficult for citizens to get constitutional amendments on the ballot.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Proposals like that can wait until the regular session in March, said Mr. Perez, the House speaker. The special session is expected to conclude by Tuesday evening, he added.</p><p>Among other things, Mr. Perez called several of the governor’s immigration proposals “bureaucratic.”</p><p>The use of such blunt language against Mr. DeSantis or his priorities had been highly unusual among Florida Republicans, who hold supermajorities in the House and Senate. Only in private did they grumble in recent years about Mr. DeSantis’s stifling approach.</p><p>But on Monday, the House and Senate unanimously overrode some of his budget vetoes, reinstating about $57 million for legislative operating expenses. The last time the Legislature overrode a Florida governor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/florida-republicans-flex-muscle-override-7-crist-vetoes-idUSTRE6AG0YU/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appears to have been</a> in 2010.</p><p>In response to Monday’s developments, Mr. DeSantis <a href="https://x.com/govrondesantis/status/1883944039432741070?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> that he was glad that lawmakers had “finally agreed to come in and do their job,” two weeks after he called for a special session. But he called their proposed bill “substantially weaker” than what he had wanted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ben Albritton, the Senate president, at the State Capitol in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Sears/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The Legislature’s bill is a bait-and-switch tactic trying to create the illusion of an illegal immigration crack down, when it does anything but,” Mr. DeSantis wrote. “It is an insult to name such a weak bill after President Trump, who has been so strong on this issue.”</p><p>Soon after Mr. DeSantis called the special session, Republican leaders said the move was premature, the first inkling that they intended to push back at the governor. Mr. DeSantis then devoted several public appearances across the state to shaming lawmakers, suggesting that they were typical politicians who campaigned on difficult issues but then preferred not to legislate on them.</p><p>“You can view me as, like, a dog that’s got you on the ankle on immigration,” Mr. DeSantis told reporters last week, adding that he would not just let the issue go.</p><p>Mr. Perez said the immigration issue became relevant for the Legislature once Mr. Trump took office and signed a slew of executive orders on federal immigration policy. The bill that state representatives will consider between Monday and Tuesday is titled “Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy Act” — that is, the TRUMP Act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The bill would identify and fund new detention spaces for unauthorized immigrants and name the Florida agricultural commissioner, Wilton Simpson, as the state’s chief immigration officer. Giving that title to Mr. Simpson, who is not close with Mr. DeSantis, was seen as another challenge to the governor. On X, Mr. DeSantis called the proposal unconstitutional.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis and Republican legislative leaders all want to stop allowing in-state tuition rates for students who were brought to Florida illegally as children. That policy has been in place since 2014, when it was championed by Jeanette M. Núñez, who was then a state representative from Miami. She is now Mr. DeSantis’s lieutenant governor.</p><p>Ms. Núñez <a href="https://x.com/LtGovNunez/status/1883150780544282691" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a> over the weekend that “our country looks very different today than it did then.”</p><p>“Florida will not incentivize illegal immigration through this law or any other,” she wrote.</p><p>State Representative Fentrice Driskell of Tampa, the House Democratic minority leader, told reporters that Mr. DeSantis and Republican leaders did not disagree much on policy.</p><p>But, she added, she favors a stronger separation of powers: “It’s healthy, that they rebuffed the governor.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
