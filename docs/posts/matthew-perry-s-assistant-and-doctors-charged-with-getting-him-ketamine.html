That investigation has revealed a broad, underground criminal network responsible for distributing large quantities of ketamine to Mr. Perry and others. This network included a live- in assistant, various go-betweens, two medical doctors and a major source of drug supply known as, quote, the ketamine queen. We’ve charged five defendants in this matter. These defendants took advantage of Mr. Perry’s addiction issues to enrich themselves. They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking great danger to Mr. Perry, but they did it anyways.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/28/multimedia/00perry-khbt/00perry-khbt-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Matthew Perry’s personal assistant, two doctors and two others have been indicted and charged with providing the ketamine that caused his death.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matt-stevens"><img alt="Matt Stevens" title="Matt Stevens" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/multimedia/author-matt-stevens/author-matt-stevens-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matt-stevens" itemprop="name">Matt Stevens</a></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="reading-time-module"><p><time datetime="2024-08-15T18:45:38-04:00"><span>Aug. 15, 2024</span><span>Updated <span>6:45 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/es/2024/08/15/espanol/matthew-perry-muerte-arresto.html" data-version="es" title="Read in Spanish">Leer en español</a></p></div></header><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Matthew Perry’s personal assistant, two doctors and two others have been indicted and charged with providing the ketamine that caused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-dead.html" title="">the death of Mr. Perry</a>, a star on the television show “Friends,” the authorities said on Thursday.</p><p>In documents filed in federal court in California, prosecutors said that Mr. Perry’s assistant and an acquaintance had worked with two doctors and a drug dealer to procure tens of thousands of dollars worth of ketamine for Mr. Perry, who had long struggled with substance abuse and addiction.</p><p>The actor, who gained sitcom superstardom as Chandler Bing on “Friends,” was discovered floating face down in a hot tub at his home in Los Angeles on Oct. 28. The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office said in an autopsy report that Mr. Perry, 54, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/arts/matthew-perry-cause-death-friends.html" title="">died of “acute effects of ketamine</a>.”</p><p>An indictment filed in federal court on Wednesday detailed grand jury charges against Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors said was known as “the Ketamine Queen,” and Dr. Salvador Plasencia, known as “Dr. P.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Sangha maintained a “stash house” in North Hollywood, the indictment said, and Dr. Plasencia, a physician at an urgent care center, was among those who worked to get the ketamine to Mr. Perry despite knowing he had a history of drug abuse.</p><p>Court documents say that Mr. Perry’s personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, injected him with at least 27 shots of ketamine in the five days leading up to his death, including at least three on the day he died. An indictment said that the defendants used coded language to discuss drug deals, referring to bottles of ketamine as “Dr Pepper,” “cans” and “bots.” And it said that when Dr. Plasencia texted with another doctor about how much to charge Mr. Perry for ketamine, he wrote, “I wonder how much this moron will pay” and “Lets find out.”</p><p>Ketamine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/health/psychedelics-mdma-psilocybin-molly-mental-health.html" title="">a powerful anesthetic with psychedelic properties</a>, is increasingly being used as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/health/psychedelics-mdma-psilocybin-molly-mental-health.html" title="">an alternative therapy</a> for depression, anxiety and other mental health problems. It is also used, and abused, recreationally.</p><p>Three people have already pleaded guilty in the case, officials said.</p><p>Mr. Iwamasa pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death.</p><p>Dr. Mark Chavez, who admitted to selling ketamine to Dr. Plasencia, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine. Dr. Chavez obtained ketamine by making false representations to a wholesale ketamine distributor and by submitting a fraudulent prescription in the name of a former patient, officials said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Erik Fleming, an acquaintance of Mr. Perry’s, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death, officials said. They said he admitted to obtaining the ketamine from Ms. Sangha and distributing 50 vials of ketamine to Mr. Iwamasa.</p><p>“We’re sending a clear message,” Martin Estrada, the United States attorney for the Central District of California, said at a Thursday news conference in downtown Los Angeles. “If you are in the business of selling dangerous drugs, we will hold you accountable for the deaths that you cause.”</p><p>The charges against Ms. Sangha and Dr. Plasencia include conspiracy to distribute ketamine; distribution of ketamine resulting in death; possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine; and altering and falsifying records related to a federal investigation.</p><p>If they are convicted, Ms. Sangha, 41, faces between 10 years and life in prison while Dr. Plasencia, 42, faces up to 10 years in prison for each ketamine-related count and up to 20 years for each count of falsifying records.</p><p>Mr. Iwamasa, 59, faces up to 15 years in prison and Mr. Fleming, 54, up to 25 years. Dr. Chavez, 54, has been charged in an information pursuant to a plea agreement and will be arraigned on Aug. 30; he faces up to 10 years in federal prison.</p><p>Attempts to reach the defendants were not immediately successful.</p><p>Anne Milgram, the head of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, said at the news conference that Mr. Perry had sought treatment for depression and anxiety and, after visiting a local clinic, had become addicted to intravenous ketamine.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Perry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/arts/television/matthew-perry-friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing.html" title="">wrote about his history of drug and alcohol addiction</a> in a memoir. Officials declined to explain whether the ketamine treatment he initially received was legitimate and would not say how he became connected to Dr. Plasencia and Dr. Chavez.</p><p>“When clinic doctors refused to increase his dosage, he turned to unscrupulous doctors who saw Perry as a way to make quick money,” Ms. Milgram said of the actor. “Dr. Plasencia and Dr. Chavez violated the oath they took to care for their patients. Instead of do no harm, they did harm so that they could make more money.”</p><p>The autopsy report said that Mr. Perry had been on ketamine infusion therapy but that the level of ketamine found in his blood was equivalent to the amount that would be used during general anesthesia.</p><p>Dr. Plasencia was accused in the indictment of misleading officials about Mr. Perry’s treatment. Prosecutors said he “provided a falsified document purportedly showing the medical treatment plan for Victim M.P.” that claimed he was being given a maximum dose of 60 milligrams over 24 hours. They added that, “in fact, as defendant Plasencia then well knew, defendant Plasencia injected Victim M.P. with ketamine dosages far in excess of 60 milligrams.”</p><p>The police in Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/arts/matthew-perry-ketamine-investigation.html" title="">acknowledged this year</a> that they were working with the D.E.A. to investigate the source of Mr. Perry’s ketamine and whether it was obtained legally. The United States Postal Inspection Service assisted with the investigation.</p><p>“The Postal Service will not be an unwitting accomplice to anyone using the U.S. mail to distribute illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia, said Matthew Shields, the acting inspector in charge of the service’s Los Angeles division.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In the weeks leading to Mr. Perry’s death, the indictment and law enforcement officials said, Dr. Plasencia sold roughly $55,000 worth of ketamine to Mr. Iwamasa and personally injected Mr. Perry with the drug at Mr. Perry’s residence.</p><p>During one visit, a large dose caused Mr. Perry to “freeze up,” prosecutors said, causing the doctor to advise against a similarly sized injection in the future. Dr. Plasencia also injected Mr. Perry with ketamine while inside a vehicle in a public parking lot in Long Beach, Calif., according to court papers.</p><p>At one point, the doctors charged Mr. Perry $2,000 for a vial of ketamine that cost Dr. Chavez roughly $12, Ms. Milgram said.</p><p>Court documents also outlined the days leading up to Mr. Perry’s death.</p><p>Mr. Fleming, who shared a mutual friend with Mr. Perry, texted him offering to sell him ketamine for a “good price” as long as he received a “fair tip for bringing it.” Mr. Fleming later told Mr. Iwamasa that his source, Ms. Sangha, dealt with “high end” celebrities.</p><p>“I guarantee it’s going to be amazing,” Mr. Fleming texted Mr. Iwamasa.</p><p>Mr. Fleming delivered a sample vial to Mr. Perry’s home, and then Mr. Iwamasa agreed to buy 25 vials, advancing Mr. Fleming $500 for “logistics.” He delivered 25 more vials on Oct. 24, four days before Mr. Perry’s death.</p><p>In March, Ms. Sangha was charged with possession of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute; she has pleaded not guilty. Law enforcement raided her home in North Hollywood that month, seizing 79 bottles of liquid ketamine and nearly 2,000 grams of methamphetamine pills, along with other drugs, according to court documents.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The two doctors charged in Mr. Perry’s death have known each other for years, one of them said in a post on social media.</p><p>Dr. Chavez has built a brand for himself as what he calls “The Health MD,” describing himself online as a longevity coach, medical doctor, entrepreneur and fitness trailblazer. Having started his career as a medical chemist, Dr. Chavez recently listed himself as a medical director at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/health/regenerative-medicine-risks-ethics.html" title="">a company specializing in regenerative medicine</a>.
