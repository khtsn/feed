Dr. Plasencia, a physician at an urgent care center, was among those who worked to get the ketamine to Mr. Perry despite knowing he had a history of drug abuse, according to the indictment.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The charges against them include conspiracy to distribute ketamine; distribution of ketamine resulting in death; possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine; and altering and falsifying records related to a federal investigation.</p><p>Mr. Perry’s personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa; another doctor, Mark Chavez; and Erik Fleming, an acquaintance of Mr. Perry’s, were all charged separately with<strong> </strong>counts including conspiracy to distribute ketamine, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who was granted anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.</p><p>Some of those involved used encrypted messaging applications and coded language to discuss drug deals, including referring to bottles of ketamine as “Dr Pepper,” “cans” and “bots,” according to court documents.</p><p>On Sept. 30, they say Dr. Plasencia, who is listed as a physician at an urgent care center in Calabasas, Calif., texted Dr. Chavez about purchasing ketamine so he could sell the ketamine to the “victim M.P.” — who a law enforcement official confirmed was Matthew Perry. In a text message, prosecutors say Dr. Plasencia discussed with Mr. Chavez how much to charge Mr. Perry, writing, “I wonder how much this moron will pay” and “Lets find out.”</p><p>A news conference is scheduled in Los Angeles on Thursday morning.</p><p>Ketamine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/health/psychedelics-mdma-psilocybin-molly-mental-health.html" title="">a powerful anesthetic with psychedelic properties</a>, is increasingly being used as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/health/psychedelics-mdma-psilocybin-molly-mental-health.html" title="">an alternative therapy</a> for depression, anxiety and other mental health problems. It is also used, and abused, recreationally.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The police in Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/arts/matthew-perry-ketamine-investigation.html" title="">acknowledged this year</a> that they were working with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate the source of Perry’s ketamine and whether it was obtained legally. </p><p>The autopsy report said that Mr. Perry had been on ketamine infusion therapy, but it determined that the ketamine in his system could not have been from his last known therapy session, about a week and a half before he died. The autopsy said the level of ketamine found in Mr. Perry’s blood was equivalent to the amount that would be used during general anesthesia.</p><p>In the indictment, Dr. Plasencia was accused of misleading officials about Mr. Perry’s treatment. Prosecutors said that he “provided a falsified document purportedly showing the medical treatment plan for Victim M.P.” that claimed he was being given a maximum dose of 60 milligrams over 24 hours. It said that “in fact, as defendant Plasencia then well knew, defendant Plasencia injected Victim M.P. with ketamine dosages far in excess of 60 milligrams.”</p><p>In the weeks leading to Mr. Perry’s death, the indictment said, Dr. Plasencia sold thousands of dollars worth of ketamine to Mr. Iwamasa and personally injected Mr. Perry with the drug at Mr. Perry’s residence. During one visit, a large dose caused Mr. Perry to “freeze up,” prosecutors said, causing the doctor to advise against a similarly sized injection in the future. He also injected Mr. Perry with ketamine in a public parking lot in Long Beach, Calif., while inside of a vehicle, according to court papers.</p><p>On Oct. 24, Mr. Fleming, the acquaintance, purchased 25 vials of ketamine from Ms. Sangha and delivered them to Mr. Iwamasa at Mr. Perry’s home. Mr. Iwamasa administered at least six shots of ketamine to Mr. Perry. Mr. Iwamasa injected Mr. Perry with more than 20 shots of ketamine over the next four days, causing Mr. Perry to die on Oct. 28, prosecutors said.</p><p>Ms. Sangha is facing another federal drug charge. She was charged this year with possession of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute and has pleaded not guilty. Law enforcement raided her home in North Hollywood in March, seizing 79 bottles of liquid ketamine and nearly 2,000 methamphetamine pills, according to court documents.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Plasencia described Dr. Chavez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvador-plasencia-119b361b8/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a> as a mentor of his for 15 years, writing that Dr. Chavez had been “extremely helpful to me as I navigated my own path as a medical entrepreneur.”</p><p>Dr. Chavez has built a brand for himself as what he calls “The Health MD,” describing himself online as a longevity coach, medical doctor, entrepreneur and fitness trailblazer. Having started his career as a medical chemist, Dr. Chavez recently listed himself as a medical director at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/health/regenerative-medicine-risks-ethics.html" title="">a company specializing in regenerative medicine</a>.
