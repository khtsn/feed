    <h1>How Donald Trump Went From Calling for a TikTok Ban to Backing Off</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Four years ago, President Donald J. Trump denounced TikTok, the Chinese-owned video sharing app, as a threat to America’s national security. This week, as Mr. Trump prepares to retake the White House, he called it a “unique medium for freedom of expression.”</p><p>The comment was part of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/us/politics/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-trump.html" title="">brief he filed to the Supreme Court</a> on Friday, asking the justices to pause a ban on TikTok set to take effect next month so that he could “negotiate a resolution” to save the platform.</p><p>A law passed with wide bipartisan support and signed by President Biden in April calls for ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, to sell the app to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States because of its risk to national security and free speech. The justices are considering the company’s challenge to that law.</p><p>TikTok has said the law violates the First Amendment. It also says that its corporate parent is majority-owned by global investors.</p></div></div>
