Some who left are sheltering five miles north at Greenwood Lake Middle School, while others found shelter elsewhere, Mr. Wernick added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The voluntary evacuation will remain in effect until at least Monday, and schools will be closed Monday in Greenwood Lake.</p><p>The region has received little to no rainfall since Sept. 29, sparking brush fires that have swept across parts of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/wildfires-drought-new-jersey-connecticut.html" title="">New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/nyregion/jennings-creek-wildfire-ny-nj.html" title="">burned thousands of acres</a> of bone-dry land. Each state has declared a <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/air-quality/open-burning" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">burn</a> <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/#:~:text=in%20response%20to%20prolonged%20dry,No%20charcoal%20fires%20are%20allowed." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ban</a> that prohibits people from starting bonfires and burning refuse, tires or trash.</p><p>The conditions are part of a dry spell across the United States: As of Nov. 12, nearly half of the country, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, was experiencing a drought, according to the <a href="https://www.drought.gov/current-conditions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Drought Monitor</a>.</p><p>Conditions in the tristate area are expected to improve this week, Bill Goodman, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said. Jennings Creek and other parts of New York and New Jersey are expected to receive two inches of rainfall from early Wednesday morning through Thursday night.</p><p>The precipitation “would be welcome, but it will only be a little bit of a dent,” Mr. Goodman said. The area has received at least 7 to 8 inches of rain less than is normal at this time of year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We hope it will be enough to wet dry leaves and pine needles that fuel these fires,” he added. “But we’ll just have to see what happens, and take it one storm at a time.”</p><p>New York City is expected to get the same amount of rain midweek after a weekslong dry spell, according to the National Weather Service forecast. City officials issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/nyregion/drought-watch-nyc-weather.html" title="">drought warning</a> earlier this month urging residents to conserve water.</p><p>From Nov. 1 through Nov. 14, the New York Fire Department responded to 271 brush fires, the most in a two-week period in the city’s modern history, Robert S. Tucker, the fire commissioner, said in a statement. Those included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/prospect-park-fire.html" title="">a blaze in Prospect Park</a> in Brooklyn and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/nyregion/inwood-hill-park-fire-nyc.html" title="">fire in Inwood Hill Park</a> in Manhattan that sent plumes of smoke across the city.</p><p>The Fire Department on Sunday said the agency created a new task force to change the way it responds to brush fires. It will include fire marshals, fire inspectors and tactical drone units, and will investigate what caused each blaze and streamline the way the agency collects brush fire data.</p><p>“The threat of fast-spreading brush fires fueled by dry vegetation and windy conditions have resulted in an historic increase of brush fires throughout New York City,” Commissioner Tucker said in the statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He added that “putting protocols in place to keep our members safe while they are in the field, and working to identify the causes of these fires after they happen” would help the department target high-risk spots.</p><p>Containing the fire in Jennings Creek on Saturday required dumping nearly 22,000 gallons of water from overhead using helicopters from the New York Army National Guard and the New York State Police, Mr. Wernick said.</p><p>Fire personnel were able to control the spread, he said, but the fire continues to burn, mostly in Sterling Forest State Park.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
