It was a hint of a revolution underway in American agriculture, driven by a desire to combat climate change while still feeding and fueling the world.</p><p>Inside that liquid were bacteria whose DNA had been altered so that once the corn seeds are in the ground, the bacteria create extra nutrients for the plants. That could greatly reduce the need for the chemical fertilizers that dominate modern agriculture and are a source of the pollution that is heating the planet.</p><p>As the dangers of climate change become more apparent, scientists and entrepreneurs are exploring ways to engineer natural systems to reduce greenhouse gasses.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266004/global-fertilizer-market-size/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$200 billion</a> industry dominated by a few global giants like Koch Industries, chemical fertilizer is made by mixing nitrogen from the air with hydrogen from natural gas at high temperatures and pressure to create ammonia.
