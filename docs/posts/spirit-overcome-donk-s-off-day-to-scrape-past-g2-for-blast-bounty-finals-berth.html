		<p>The first day of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">VCT China 2025 Stage 2 playoffs</a> is complete, with the first two upper bracket games revealing which teams will face off against their respective one-seed opponents for much higher stakes. </p>

<p>Both matches were sweeps, but the consequences of these two wins could significantly alter the outcome of who makes it to the Champions in 2025.</p>



<p>Starting the playoffs, we had two teams trying to make their mark after a much-improved Stage 2 performance. Both <span data-ref-id="0">

</span> ended Stage 2 at 3-2, and their matchup against each other began on Lotus.</p>

<p>This map was AG&#39;s pick, but TYLOO were the ones to take an early lead by winning pistol and converting the bonus. Two players on TYLOO, <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/41739/slowly">
		slowly	</a>
</span> on Omen and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11843/yoyo">
		Yoyo	</a>
</span> on Raze, both soared in the first half as the lead only grew. The double Duelist composition from AG struggled heavily against the more standard double Controller comp from TYLOO, as the half ended 10-2.</p>

<p>AG needed a big comeback to keep Lotus in reach, but another pistol loss was the nail in the coffin for map one. Even after winning a force round on round 14, TYLOO took it right back to finish the map 13-3.</p>

<p>Icebox was the first opportunity for TYLOO to win the series, but the team wasn&#39;t at the same level of dominance as Lotus. Both teams ran mirror compositions, with double Controller, Jett, and Killjoy to try and hold the defensive sites. AG were able to win their first pistol round, with <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4881/spitfires">
		Spitfires	</a>
</span> leading the way to their first lead of the series. That lead only lasted a little bit, as TYLOO won an important round down 4v5 around a Viper ultimate from Yoyo. The teams traded rounds, ending the half tied at 6-6.</p>

<p>With the sides flipping, AG once again needed to win pistol to try and get a lead, and TYLOO denied that thanks to <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3049/sword9">
		sword9	</a>
</span> and Yoyo. To rub salt in the wound, slowly got an Outlaw ace on the eco round from AG, thanks to two collaterals.</p>


<p><em>slowly gets a satisfying Outlaw ace against AG. (Clip via Project Horizon)</em></p>

<p>AG was able to stop the bonus conversion from TYLOO to keep the map within reach. In fact, after that Outlaw ace, AG won five of the next six rounds to go up 11-9. It looked like AG was winning map two and bringing the series to Haven, with Spitfires and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/42537/hanche">
		HanChe	</a>
</span> leading the way. Yet, 11 was all they would get, as TYLOO would both stall plants and stop aggressive plays from AG to win Icebox 13-11 and the series 2-0.</p>

<p>The star for this playoff win was Yoyo, who impressed on both Raze and Viper to win two very different ways. He ended the series with a 1.29 match rating, 37 kills, 270 ACS, 85% KAST, and 180 ADR.</p>

</span> was also a matchup of two 3-2 teams from opposing groups, but all eyes and pressure were on EDG. Not only have they struggled to replicate the regional or international performances they were known for in 2024, but finding their fifth player has proved to be tougher than anyone expected. New pickup <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7135/zjc">
		zjc	</a>
</span> was quickly swapped back with <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span>, and DRG would be their first test if they were back in form.</p>

<p>Starting a series on Lotus for the second time today, EDG won the first pistol thanks to <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> and his trademark aggression, as he also learned his 2000 kill milestone, the first player in China to do so. Both teams ran a double Duelist comp, with <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> on Yoru to face off against <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/52904/akeman">
		Akeman	</a>
</span> on Neon and <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/31753/spiritz1">
		SpiritZ1	</a>
</span> on Yoru. EDG started well, with trades coming in and a bonus conversion under their belt, reaching a 4-0 lead. However, even with ZmjjKK leading the way with 17 kills in the first half, DRG kept their composure and worked well as a team to reach the half only down 7-5.</p>

<p>Now, DRG was on the attack side with two duelists, and despite EDG winning the second pistol, DRG were able to build momentum by denying the bonus conversion. Just after, Akeman showed just why his Neon should be feared, with four kills to shock EDG. </p>


<p><em>Akeman gets four kills against EDG. (Clip via Project Horizon)</em></p>

<p>SpiritZ1 was also starting to heat up on the attack side, as DRG scraped together an 11-10 lead. EDG was able to tie the game heading to overtime, but DRG won the first two OT rounds quickly to win their map pick 14-12 and take the series lead.</p>

<p>Next up was Corrode, the newest map in Valorant that teams are still learning across all regions. EDG ran double Duelist, nobody on Yoru, and double Controller with no Sentinel player. DRG instead opted for a Gekko/Cypher/Yoru composition, which immediately showed value in their first pistol win. DRG was unable to convert the bonus, and EDG did adapt to the plays coming from DRG to keep the half within reach. After EDG tied the game 5-5 late into the first half, it was <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4705/flex1n">
		Flex1n	</a>
</span> to save the team down 3v5, getting two entry kills on A site and giving DRG a 7-5 lead at the half.</p>

<p>EDG won the second pistol to tie the series again at 7-7, winning all pistols in the series without losing a single antieco. However, after losing the bonus round, DRG showed their capability in the gun rounds. Every time EDG fought back to keep the map close, DRG won a big round afterward to keep their lead, highlighted by round 21. The map was tied 10-10, with DRG potentially going broke if they lost the round. DRG executed a nice trap play late outside B site to force a save from EDG, and Akeman and Flex1n closed it out as DRG won Corrode 13-10 and the series 2-0.</p>

<p>The series MVP was SpiritZ1, who won the Yoru duel handily in this game against EDG. He ended the series with a 1.43 match rating, 52 kills, 322 ACS, 86% KAST, 205 ADR, and 12 first kills.</p>
