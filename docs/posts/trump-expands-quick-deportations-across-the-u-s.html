Such sweeping powers — a process known as expedited removal, which allows unauthorized immigrants to be deported without court proceedings — have long been reserved primarily for the area near the southern border.</p><p>But the policy issued by the acting homeland security secretary, Benjamine C. Huffman, allows ICE officers to use it across the entirety of the United States.</p><p>“The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,” the notice read.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s first administration tried to implement a similarly speedy nationwide process for deportations, but those efforts were challenged in federal court. The ensuing legal battle kept the rule from going into effect until late 2020, when a federal appeals court allowed the Homeland Security Department to move forward with expanded expedited removals while the lawsuit continued. The Biden administration rescinded the policy.</p><p>Like some of Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-starts-immigration-crackdown-enlisting-the-military-and-testing-the-law.html" title="">other early actions around immigration</a>, the rule could be met with another legal challenge.</p><p>Generally, unauthorized immigrants picked up in the U.S. are given a notice to appear in immigration court, where they could make their case to stay in the country. The courts are struggling under a backlog of more than three million cases, leading to some cases being scheduled years in the future. Deportation proceedings typically can’t begin until a judge issues a decision.</p><p>By cutting out court proceedings for immigrants who meet the parameters of the policy, the sped-up process could offer the Trump administration another tool to fulfill the president’s campaign promise to conduct mass deportations early in his presidency, experts and former ICE officials said.</p><p>“Expanded expedited removal could spur much faster deportations and increase the number of migrants removed. Unlike lengthy immigration court proceedings that can take years, expedited removal can be done in a matter of hours,” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Bush-Joseph said the burden would be on migrants to provide documentation showing that “they have been in the country for more than two years, have lawful status, or a claim to protection such as asylum.”</p><p>Corey Price, a former senior ICE official who oversaw deportations at the agency, said the policy could make a big difference for ICE officers tasked with removing more people.</p><p>“I would expect they would lean into this heavily,” he said.</p><p>Immigrant rights groups quickly denounced the measure as a way to scare immigrants across the country.</p><p>“Expedited removal is a deeply flawed practice that often denies immigrants a fair opportunity to access relief, separates families unnecessarily and makes a mockery of the right to access counsel,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, which helps represent immigrants.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz">More about Hamed Aleaziz</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/homeland-security-department">Homeland Security Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Who Could Be Deported?: </strong>President-elect Donald Trump has promised to deport millions of migrants.
