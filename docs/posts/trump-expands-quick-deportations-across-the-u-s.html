Such sweeping powers — a process known as expedited removal, which allows unauthorized immigrants to be deported without court proceedings — have long been reserved primarily for the area near the southern border.</p><p>But the policy issued by the acting homeland security secretary, Benjamine C. Huffman, allows ICE officers to use it across the entirety of the United States.</p><p>“The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,” the notice read.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s first administration tried to implement a similarly speedy nationwide process for deportations, but those efforts were challenged in federal court. The ensuing legal battle kept the rule from going into effect until late 2020, when a federal appeals court allowed the Homeland Security Department to move forward with expanded expedited removals while the lawsuit continued. The Biden administration rescinded the policy.</p><p>Like some of Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-starts-immigration-crackdown-enlisting-the-military-and-testing-the-law.html" title="">other early actions around immigration</a>, the rule could be met with another legal challenge.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
