data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>For years, the global auditing and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers was a dominant player in China, helping the country’s biggest companies reap big gains — and enriching itself along the way.</p><p>Now, it has become targeted in a sweeping crackdown by Beijing that imperils the future of its business in China, charged with enabling the sprawling financial misdeeds committed by China Evergrande Group, once China’s leading real estate developer.</p><p>The Ministry of Finance and the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Friday suspended PwC’s operations in China for six months and fined the firm $62 million — the largest fine levied on an auditing firm in China.</p><p>PwC “knew that Evergrande made material misstatements in its financial statements for the years from 2018 to 2020,” the finance ministry said, adding that the auditing firm also “failed to point them out, issuing an inappropriate audit opinion and a falsified audit report.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-network-statement-regarding-pwc-zhong-tian-llp-administrative-penalties.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, Mohamed Kande, the global chair of PwC, said that the work of its auditors in China was “completely unacceptable.” The company said it had cooperated with Chinese regulators and would comply with the penalties they imposed.</p><p>The firm said it fired six partners, along with other staff members, involved in the Evergrande audit work. “It is not representative of what we stand for as a network and there is no room for this at PwC,” Mr. Kande said.</p><p>PwC, one of the so-called Big Four accounting firms, has drawn attention this year as Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has called for financial oversight that has “teeth.”</p><p>In March, Chinese regulators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/business/china-evergrande-fined.html" title="">fined</a> Evergrande’s founder, Hui Ka Yan, $6.5 million and barred him from domestic financial markets for exaggerating Evergrande’s revenue by more than $78 billion. He was also accused of committing securities fraud for two years before the collapse of the company.</p><p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/business/china-evergrande-fined.html" title="">reported last year</a> that questionable accounting and poor oversight led to Evergrande’s demise. It had been treating money it received for apartments as revenue, even when it had not built those apartments, The Times report found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Evergrande’s default in 2021 set off a chain of collapses of Chinese property developers and triggered a housing crisis that authorities are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/business/china-property-crisis.html" title="">still trying</a> to resolve. The developer came to symbolize the excesses of China’s property boom, and its downfall exposed how it had enriched an entire ecosystem — including global auditors, local governments, foreign investors and, for some time, a nation of home buyers.</p><p>But now the housing crash has left the nation reeling and officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/business/china-property-mortgages.html" title="">scrambling</a> to plug a gaping financial hole.</p><p>“It’s difficult for me to imagine that a company as prestigious as PwC could completely abandon their professional ethics,” said Gao Pingyang, associate dean of the business school at the University of Hong Kong.</p><p>“This problem of accounting and this conduct is really a cancer to the Chinese capital market,” he said.</p><p>The securities regulator was scathing in its assessment of PwC, saying the firm overlooked the scale of the fraud that was taking place at Evergrande. The agency found PwC had “violated multiple audit standards and audit requirements,” and failed to maintain “professional skepticism.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The regulator called PwC’s audits of Evergrande “distorted” and “seriously unreliable.” As one example, it said that PwC allowed Evergrande to deem some apartments ready to be handed over to buyers even though construction had still not been finished years later when investigators conducted their own on-site investigations.</p><p>Sometimes, the regulator said, there was just “empty land” in the place of properties that were on paper logged as ready.</p><p>It is not the first time that one of the Big Four accounting firms has been held responsible for the collapse of a Chinese corporate giant.</p><p>Last year, the authorities meted out a $30 million fine against Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu for its audit work with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/business/economy/huarong-bailout-china.html" title="">China Huarong Asset Management</a>, a financial conglomerate, that nearly collapsed before the government helped to bail it out in 2021.</p><p>It was then the steepest fine dealt by the authority.</p><p>Chinese investigators found that Deloitte had failed to do its job evaluating the quality of Huarong’s assets, and did not apply proper auditing procedures. Two former officials at Huarong were sentenced to death for taking bribes. One of the officials, Lai Xiaomin, was executed within a month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/business/china-huarong-death-penalty.html" title="">of the sentence</a> in 2021. A second Huarong official, Bai Tianhui, was sentenced to death in May.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The crackdowns are a turnabout for the Chinese authorities, who for decades had stayed on the sidelines as companies took huge risks and borrowed heavily, building empires. Now, in the aftermath of tens of billions of dollars of losses by these firms, the government is looking more closely at what went wrong.</p><p>Mr. Xi has set his sights on rooting out financial crimes and has called on officials to make sure that oversight of the financial system has “<a href="https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202401/16/content_WS65a63e4dc6d0868f4e8e321d.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teeth and horns</a>.” In May, he again urged financial regulators, as well as local governments, to play a more active role in confronting financial risks.</p><p>PwC is also under investigation by the Financial Reporting Council in Hong Kong, where a judge recently ordered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/business/china-evergrande.html" title="">Evergrande to liquidate</a> in a victory for international investors who gave the company tens of billions of dollars in Hong Kong.</p><p>“If there is administrative action taken against PwC in Hong Kong, both global shareholders and bondholders could potentially sue the deep-pocketed PwC,” said Mr. Gao at the University of Hong Kong.</p><p>“That,” he added, “could financially drain PwC.”</p><p>Chris Buckley<!-- --> from Taipei, Taiwan, and <!-- -->Zixu Wang<!-- --> from Hong Kong contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
