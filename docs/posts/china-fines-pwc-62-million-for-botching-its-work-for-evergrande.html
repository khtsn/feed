    <h1>China Fines PwC $62 Million for Botching Its Work for Evergrande</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PwC “knew that Evergrande Real Estate made material misstatements in its financial statements for the years from 2018 to 2020,” the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that the auditor also “failed to point them out, issuing an inappropriate audit opinion and a falsified audit report.”</p><p>In a statement, Mohamed Kande, the global chair of PwC, said in a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-network-statement-regarding-pwc-zhong-tian-llp-administrative-penalties.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that the work of its auditors in China was “completely unacceptable.” The company said it had cooperated with Chinese regulators and would comply with the penalties they imposed. </p><p>The firm fired six partners, along with other staff members, involved in the Evergrande audit work. “It is not representative of what we stand for as a network and there is no room for this at PwC,” Mr. Kande said.</p><p>PwC, one of the so-called Big Four accounting firms, has drawn attention this year as Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has called for financial oversight that has “teeth.”</p><p>In March, Chinese regulators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/business/china-evergrande-fined.html" title="">fined</a> Evergrande’s founder, Hui Ka Yan, $6.5 million and barred him from domestic financial markets for exaggerating Evergrande’s revenue by more than $78 billion. He was also accused of committing securities fraud for two years before the collapse of the company.</p></div></div>
