World leaders including Vice President JD Vance and top church officials sat in the Roman sun for the outdoor service that officially installed Leo as leader of 1.4 billion Roman Catholics.</p><p>Evoking some of the messages of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who died in April, Leo, used the occasion to plead for peace in Ukraine, Gaza and Myanmar. As he became the 267th head of the Roman Catholic Church, Leo said that his priority was for the church to hold to its mission of evangelization, another echo of Francis, and chart a path that included as many people in the church as possible.</p><p>It “is never a question of capturing others by force, by religious propaganda or by means of power,” but through love, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia were among the world leaders who had flown to Rome to attend the Mass. The pope shook hands with dignitaries, including Mr. Vance and Mr. Zelensky, whom he was expected to meet with later on Sunday.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President JD Vance greeting President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine ahead of the mass.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Jacquelyn Martin</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Vance’s visit to the Vatican has been seen as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/pope-leo-conservatives.html" title="">potential reset</a> for the strained relationship between the papacy and conservative Catholics in the United States. Four weeks ago, Mr. Vance met with Francis, who had publicly chastised his theology and position on immigration. On Sunday, he greeted a leader who appears to share many of his predecessor’s views, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/18/world/pope-leo-xiv-mass#jd-vance-has-come-to-greet-the-new-pope-but-old-tensions-loom" title="">direct criticism</a> of Mr. Vance in a now-deleted social media account associated with his name.</p><p>Away from politics, Sunday’s proceedings were replete with religious symbolism and Leo, who wore traditional white vestments, at times appeared visibly moved.</p><p>He prayed in Latin that he would be a worthy successor of St. Peter, who, as ecclesiastical tradition teaches, was chosen by Jesus to be the first leader of the church.</p><p>During his homily, Leo said that the cardinals who elected him had sought a “shepherd capable of preserving the rich heritage of the Christian faith and, at the same time, looking to the future, in order to confront the questions, concerns and challenges of today’s world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“In this our time, we still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth’s resources and marginalizes the poorest,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Leo delivering the homily during Mass in St. Peter’s Square.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Antonio Masiello/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Sunday’s Mass brought to a close a period of drama for the Vatican, which began with the death of Francis on April 21 and was followed by his funeral five days later. It continued with the election of Leo at a conclave, or College of Cardinals, that started on May 7 and ended a day later, when white smoke was seen above the Sistine Chapel to signal that a new pope had been chosen.</p><p>Since his election, Leo, who was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago and is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/pope-leo-bob-villanova.html" title="">known to his friends as Bob</a>, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/europe/pope-leo-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">warned</a> of the threats posed by artificial intelligence and called for an end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Last week, he expressed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/world/europe/zelensky-attends-the-mass-after-the-pope-offered-the-vatican-as-a-venue-for-peace-talks.html" title="">personal desire to help end the war</a> in Ukraine.</p><p>He returned to the need for peace at the end of the Mass, appealing to the Catholic faithful to remember those who are suffering in the world’s wars. “In Gaza, the surviving children, families, older people are reduced to hunger,” he said. In Myanmar, new hostilities broke “young innocent lives.” Ukraine, he said, “awaits negotiations for a fair and lasting peace.”</p><p>Before the proceedings began, the pope took his first ride through St. Peter’s Square in an open top popemobile, waving at the crowd, who cheered and clapped. The Vatican said that some 200,000 people had gathered for the Mass. As they had done for the funeral of Francis on April 26 and at the subsequent conclave, the Vatican imposed a limit on the number of people who could enter St. Peter’s Square in a bid to prevent a stampede.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.</p></div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a Times reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
