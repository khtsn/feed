But at the other two bodegas, in low-income neighborhoods, Mr. Marte hands out plastic bags to avoid passing on the cost of a more expensive reusable bag to residents. Still, he warns them that he’ll soon phase out plastic altogether.</p><p>Some customers have started to bring their own bags, he said, but it’s “little by little.”</p><p>New York State’s ban in 2020 was part of an effort to curb litter and minimize greenhouse emissions caused by plastic bag production. Mr. Marte, who is also president of the Bodega and Small Business Group in New York, said compliance with the ban had been mixed among the group’s more than 2,000 members, which include corner stores, restaurants, barber shops and beauty salons. Many business owners don’t want to charge their customers more by handing out the comparatively expensive reusable bags. Still, the number of plastic bags in circulation has “reduced a lot,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/01/business/01Plastic-Bags-2-still/01Plastic-Bags-2-still-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/01/business/01Plastic-Bags-2-still/01Plastic-Bags-2-still-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/02/28/134890_1_01Plastic-Bags-2_wg_360p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>When the ban was announced, state officials said New Yorkers used 23 billion plastic bags each year, 85 percent of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/nyregion/what-to-know-new-york-state-ban-plastic-bags.html" title="">ended up</a> in landfills, recycling machines, waterways and streets.
