A firefighter in Missouri died while on a rescue call, and a 74-year-old man’s body was found in a submerged vehicle in Kentucky.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Parts of Montgomery County, Ky., have been evacuated, county officials said on social media. Parts of Shelbyville, Ky., a city of over 17,000, were also under mandatory evacuation orders because of flooding in the Big Blue and Little Blue Rivers, local officials <a href="https://shelbyville.in.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=152&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawJe0HhleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHqdXgivZJebvPpRQWui1URKkADi8LkWmXb5DRVCHo9c_3CxjMTQGSQtAY0XP_aem_oSlPnnOHDHN7157NcY8baA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>Falmouth, Ky., a small city of 2,500 on the Licking River, was also under a mandatory evacuation order, and many residents fled on Friday night and Saturday morning in anticipation of major flooding.</p><p>Debbie Dennie, a former editor of the Falmouth Outlook newspaper, said that, if forecasts hold through the weekend, “it would be devastating” for the city. She recalled flooding in the city in 1997, which killed five people. Since that disaster, river gauges have been installed to better track water levels, and evacuees have been heeding warnings of the river’s rise.</p><p>The worst of the storm has largely passed communities along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, but many areas are still reeling from the damage. In Cape Girardeau, Mo., along the Mississippi River, a pizzeria was closed indefinitely after its roof collapsed, and an antique shop’s windows were blown out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Kyleigh Baliva, who works at a separate antique store owned by her family, recalled when her shop flooded recently. “The water came up because of the rain. It had nowhere to go,” she said. “We’ve seen it happen before, but it hasn’t happened in at least 10 years like this.”</p><p>Her antique shop, which has a pump in the basement, was largely spared by the recent flooding.</p><p>In Tyrone, Jessica Stratton, who grew up there, knows her camper is already a loss and expects it to wash away. On Saturday, she brought whatever groceries she had left in her camper to Tyrone Baptist Church to organize and serve meals to those who had been displaced. She was planning to stay the night at the church or with friends.</p><p>“People are prepared and getting their stuff out. We watch and wait and make sure everyone is OK and has something to eat,” Ms. Stratton said. “I’m not leaving my people behind. Everybody’s worth saving.”</p><p>Carly Gist<!-- -->, <!-- -->Mitch Smith<!-- -->, <!-- -->Amy Graff<!-- -->, <!-- -->Yan Zhuang<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ginny Whitehouse<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
