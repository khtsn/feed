But Ms. Noem’s comments indicated that the government was, at least initially, giving travelers some leeway.</p><p>Ms. Noem noted that Congress passed the Real ID law in 2005 and the Biden administration <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/archive/news/2022/12/05/dhs-announces-extension-real-id-full-enforcement-deadline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chose May 7, 2025</a>, as the deadline to begin enforcing it after the government had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/travel/real-id-deadline-delay.html" title="">repeatedly extended</a> the deadline.</p><p>Ms. Noem said that 81 percent of travelers passing through T.S.A. checkpoints already have identification that complies with the Real ID law, which was enacted in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p><p>Investigators found that nearly all of the hijackers who boarded commercial planes that day were carrying U.S. driver’s licenses and state IDs, and that most of those documents had been obtained fraudulently.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>To apply for a Real ID, people generally need to provide a Social Security number, verify their address with utility bills, bank statements or other documents, and prove their identity and legal status with additional documents, including a birth certificate or a passport.</p><p>As the deadline for enforcement of the law has approached, many people have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/real-id-passport-domestic-flights.html" title="">scrambling to secure appointments</a> to get a Real ID, even though some already have passports or other acceptable identification. Some have said they prefer not to carry a passport because they worry it could be lost or stolen.</p><p>The law, officials acknowledge, has created some confusion among travelers and led to concerns about backups and delays at airports beginning on Wednesday. T.S.A. officials have recommended that anyone traveling with only a standard state-issued driver’s license on Wednesday give themselves an extra hour to pass through airport security.</p><p>“We have other ways to verify your identity if you don’t have a Real ID or acceptable form of ID but know that this process may take longer, so you’ll need to arrive at the airport early, and you should be good to go,” the T.S.A. said in a recent “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tsa/comments/1kbh2e0/ama_real_id_and_acceptable_forms_of_id/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ask Me Anything</a>” session on Reddit aimed at easing anxiety around the Wednesday deadline.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Levenson covers breaking news for The Times from New York.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
