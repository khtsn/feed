Gusts of up to 100 m.p.h., stronger than any the region has seen in a decade, are forecast to blow through the night.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/us/palisades-brush-fires-california" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The flames are threatening Pacific Palisades, an affluent coastal neighborhood that is home to about 24,000 people, roughly 20 miles west of downtown Los Angeles. Officials ordered residents to evacuate immediately. Part of the Pacific Coast Highway and several nearby schools were closed.</p><p>The region’s electricity provider said it was preparing to cut power to as many as 419,000 customers as a pre-emptive measure to keep wildfires from sparking under high wind conditions. “This is about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,” forecasters said.</p><p>Southern California is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/us/palisades-brush-fires-california#southern-california-is-dangerously-dry-for-this-time-of-year" title="">extremely dry right now</a>, especially for this time of year. Last month, a fire threatened the Malibu area. Officials are even more concerned this time because the windstorm is projected to affect a broader, more populated region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Forecasters issued a rare “particularly dangerous situation” red flag warning for portions of Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange Counties, including downtown Los Angeles. Typically, forecasters use this special warning every few years; this is the third time a warning of this level has been issued this season.</p><p><strong>For those in the area: </strong>Here’s how to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/well/wildfire-smoke-health.html" title="">protect yourself from wildfire smoke</a>.</p><hr/><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
