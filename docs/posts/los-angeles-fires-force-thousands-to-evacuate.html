Gusts of up to 100 m.p.h., stronger than any the region has seen in a decade, are forecast to blow through the night.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/us/palisades-brush-fires-california" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The flames are threatening Pacific Palisades, an affluent coastal neighborhood that is home to about 24,000 people, roughly 20 miles west of downtown Los Angeles. Officials ordered residents to evacuate immediately. Part of the Pacific Coast Highway and several nearby schools were closed.</p><p>The region’s electricity provider said it was preparing to cut power to as many as 419,000 customers as a pre-emptive measure to keep wildfires from sparking under high wind conditions. “This is about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,” forecasters said.</p><p>Southern California is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/us/palisades-brush-fires-california#southern-california-is-dangerously-dry-for-this-time-of-year" title="">extremely dry right now</a>, especially for this time of year. Last month, a fire threatened the Malibu area. Officials are even more concerned this time because the windstorm is projected to affect a broader, more populated region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Forecasters issued a rare “particularly dangerous situation” red flag warning for portions of Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange Counties, including downtown Los Angeles. Typically, forecasters use this special warning every few years; this is the third time a warning of this level has been issued this season.</p><p><strong>For those in the area: </strong>Here’s how to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/well/wildfire-smoke-health.html" title="">protect yourself from wildfire smoke</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-49ea5425">Trump suggested expanding the U.S. into Greenland and Canada</h2><p>Donald Trump said today at a news conference that he would not rule out the use of military or economic coercion to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/us/trump-news" title="">retake control of the Panama Canal and to force Denmark to sell Greenland to the U.S.</a> “We need them for economic security,” the president-elect said.</p><p>Trump said he would “tariff Denmark at a very high level” if it did not give Greenland to the U.S. He also suggested that Canada should become a U.S. state by getting “rid of that artificially drawn line,” but he ruled out using force to annex parts of the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Zuckerberg last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-6b8f73a2">Meta said it would end its fact-checking program</h2><p>Meta announced today that its popular apps — Facebook, Instagram and Threads — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/07/business/meta-fact-checking" title="">would stop using third-party fact-checkers</a> to curtail misinformation. Instead, the social media company will rely on users to add notes to posts that may contain false or misleading information.</p><p>The reversal was a stark sign of how the company is repositioning itself for the upcoming Trump presidency. Announcing the change on Fox News, Joel Kaplan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/business/joel-kaplan-meta.html" title="">Meta’s newly installed global policy chief</a>, said there was “too much political bias” in the fact-checking program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, described the shift as a return to “our roots around free expression.” Yesterday, Zuckerberg announced the addition of Dana White, the chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close Trump ally, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/technology/dana-white-meta-board-ufc.html" title="">to Meta’s board</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sudanese refugees from the Darfur region in Chad in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6033b5c3">The U.S. said a genocide took place in Sudan</h2><p>The U.S. declared today that the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group, and its allies had committed genocide in Sudan in their fight against the country’s military. The wave of violence took place in western Darfur, where men, boys and infants were targeted and murdered, and women were raped “on an ethnic basis,” Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said.</p><p>Members of the Masalit ethnic group were targeted, a central element in the genocide determination.

But it needed a lot of work.</p><p>During the renovation, the couple discovered a hidden staircase — which they turned into a bookcase — and a marble column. They also hired a conservator who spent eight months restoring a beautiful ceiling fresco depicting a carriage of angels. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/realestate/italy-genoa-palazzo-restoration.html" title="">Here’s what the apartment looks like now</a>.</p><p>Have an impressive evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
