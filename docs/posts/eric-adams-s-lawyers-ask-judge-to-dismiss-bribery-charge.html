    <h1>Eric Adams’s Lawyers Ask Judge to Dismiss Bribery Charge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The bribery charge against Mr. Adams focused on the approval of a new Turkish consulate building in Midtown Manhattan in 2021. At the time, Mr. Adams was Brooklyn borough president but had also won the Democratic mayoral primary, virtually guaranteeing that he would become the next mayor.</p><p>Prosecutors say Mr. Adams, at the behest of a Turkish official, pressured the Fire Department to allow the building to open, even though it would have failed a fire inspection. The skyscraper opened in time for a visit by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Adams wrote that Mr. Adams sent “three brief messages” to the Fire Department that did not “remotely convey pressure or threats.”</p><p>They argued that the prosecutors were criminalizing activity that was routine for elected officials, like helping donors with permits and other regulatory issues.</p></div></div>
