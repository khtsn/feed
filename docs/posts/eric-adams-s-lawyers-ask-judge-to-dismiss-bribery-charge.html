He pleaded not guilty to the charges last week, and has so far shown no signs of planning to resign.</p><p>Speaking at a church in the Bronx on Sunday, the mayor was defiant, saying that he would not listen to the “small number of loud people” calling on him to step down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m not going to resign — I’m going to reign,” <a href="https://x.com/GloriaPazmino/status/1840468546502922613" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>.</p><p>After Mr. Adams was indicted last week, he said the charges against him were “entirely false” and “based on lies” and that he would “fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit.”</p><p>In a news conference at his law office on Monday, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Adams, gave a further preview of the mayor’s defense, attacking the prosecutors who brought the case, accusing a key government witness of lying and arguing that the indictment was criminalizing routine political activity.</p><p>“New Yorkers will see through this,” Mr. Spiro said, repeatedly saying that the charges were “not a real case.”</p><p>The prosecutors have accused Mr. Adams of accepting luxury travel benefits worth more than $100,000, as well as illegal campaign contributions from Turkey. In exchange for the gifts, the prosecutors said, Mr. Adams granted political favors to Turkish officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-indictment-charges-annotated.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/2024-09-25-adams-annotated-indictment-index/2024-09-25-adams-annotated-indictment-index-articleLarge-v2.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Here Are the Charges Eric Adams Faces, Annotated</h2><p>The Times annotated the indictment.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But on Monday, in remarks that sounded like an opening statement in a criminal trial, Mr. Spiro sought to cast doubt on the entire case, saying the main allegations had to do with Mr. Adams’s time as Brooklyn borough president, a position with “very little” power.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Striking an unusually aggressive posture, Mr. Spiro accused the prosecutors of misconduct, alleging that they had illegally leaked information to reporters to stir up a media spectacle around the mayor. He described the prosecutors as lawyers in a room with “lots of law books and very little real-world experience.”</p><p>“They’re trying to manipulate and fool and taint all of you,” Mr. Spiro said.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, which brought the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mayor Eric Adams, sought to discredit the prosecutors who brought the corruption case against the mayor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Janice Chung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The bribery charge against Mr. Adams focused on the approval of a new Turkish consulate building in Midtown Manhattan in 2021. At the time, Mr. Adams was Brooklyn borough president, but he had recently won the Democratic mayoral primary and was virtually guaranteed to become the next mayor.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The prosecutors said Mr. Adams, at the behest of a Turkish official, pressured the Fire Department to allow the building to open, even though it would have failed a fire inspection. The skyscraper opened in time for a visit by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.</p><p>In exchange, the prosecutors said, Mr. Adams received thousands of dollars’ worth of travel benefits from Turkish officials over several years — including a free upgrade to business class for a flight to Ghana in November 2021.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Adams wrote in their motion to dismiss that Mr. Adams had sent “three brief messages” to the Fire Department that did not “remotely convey pressure or threats.”</p><p>Mr. Adams’s defense team said the prosecutors had failed to show that the mayor had specifically agreed to take the travel benefits in exchange for helping with the consulate building. In other words, they said, there was no “quid pro quo,” a key element in bribery cases.</p><p>They argued that the prosecutors were targeting activity that was routine for elected officials, like helping donors with permits and other regulatory issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Congressmen get upgrades,” Mr. Spiro said at Monday’s news conference. “They get corner suites. They get better tables at restaurants. They get free appetizers.”</p><p>These types of “courtesies,” Mr. Spiro said, are not federal crimes.</p><p>The indictment also accused Mr. Adams of concealing his misconduct by failing to list the travel benefits he had received in his required annual disclosure forms and by creating a fake paper trail to suggest that he had paid for the travel on his own.</p><p>Mr. Spiro argued that Mr. Adams was not required to submit information about “gratuities” for personal travel — and that any rule violations should result in a fine, not federal charges.</p><p>Legal experts who reviewed the charges against Mr. Adams have said that the bribery accusation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/nyregion/adams-indictment-fbi-nyc.html" title="">is likely to be the most difficult to prove</a>. In a series of rulings since 2010, the Supreme Court has repeatedly narrowed the definition of corruption, overturning the convictions of prominent politicians and making it harder to bring bribery prosecutions against public officials.</p><p>Although Monday’s filing sought to dismiss only the bribery charge, Mr. Adams’s lawyers said they would challenge the four other counts as the case progressed, arguing that they were “equally meritless because they rest on a host of false claims.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In addition to the bribery allegation, the prosecutors also accused Mr. Adams of directing his staff to take illegal campaign donations from Turkish businesspeople.</p><p>Since foreign nationals are prohibited by law from donating to mayoral campaigns, the contributions were made through “straw donors” who were U.S. citizens, to mask the true source of the funds, the prosecutors said.</p><p>At Monday’s news conference, Mr. Spiro said that without the bribery charge, the rest of the indictment was “nothing but a campaign finance case.” He said that straw donations take place in almost every campaign and that Mr. Adams had no idea about the donations in question.</p><p>Mr. Spiro also took issue with how prosecutors characterized the public matching funds that were awarded to Mr. Adams’s 2021 campaign based on alleged illegal contributions. The indictment said that the campaign had received more than $10 million in public matching funds. But Mr. Spiro said that the campaign had accepted only $18,000 of the alleged straw donations that were tied to the charges.</p><p>In a sign of the fight ahead, Mr. Adams has assembled a high-powered legal team for a potential trial, including Mr. Spiro and William A. Burck from the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan. He will also continue to work with Brendan R. McGuire and his partner at WilmerHale, Boyd M. Johnson III, who represented the mayor during the lengthy federal investigation that preceded the indictment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Spiro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/nyregion/alex-spiro-eric-adams-lawyer.html" title="">has represented</a> celebrity clients like the Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and the New England Patriots owner Robert K.
