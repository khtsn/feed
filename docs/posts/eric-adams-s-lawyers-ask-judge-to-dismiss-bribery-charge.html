At the time, Mr. Adams was Brooklyn borough president but had also won the Democratic mayoral primary, virtually guaranteeing that he would become the next mayor.</p><p>Prosecutors say Mr. Adams, at the behest of a Turkish official, pressured the Fire Department to allow the building to open, even though it would have failed a fire inspection. The skyscraper opened in time for a visit by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Adams wrote that Mr. Adams sent “three brief messages” to the Fire Department that did not “remotely convey pressure or threats.”</p><p>They argued that the prosecutors were criminalizing activity that was routine for elected officials, like helping donors with permits and other regulatory issues.</p><p>Although Monday’s filing sought to dismiss only the bribery charge, Mr. Adams’s lawyers said they would challenge the four other counts as the case progressed, arguing that they were “equally meritless because they rest on a host of false claims.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicole Hong is an investigative reporter, focused on covering New York and its surrounding regions.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicole-hong">More about Nicole Hong</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
