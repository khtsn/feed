In our conversation, she announced that she was retiring after a groundbreaking 25 years. We talked about the obstacles she has overcome, the value of diversity and why she’s ready to move on from this stage of her career.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>You’ve been ramping down dancing for a while. Why does now feel like the time to make an official retirement announcement?</strong></p><p>In all honesty, I’ve wanted to fade away into the background, which is not really possible. The legacy of what I’ve created, the way that I’m carrying so many stories of Black dancers who have come before me — I can’t just disappear. There has to be an official closing to my time at American Ballet Theater, this company that has meant everything to me.</p><p><strong>You’ve expressed your gratitude toward A.B.T., and at the same time you talk about feeling stifled or thwarted there.</strong></p><p>Whenever you’re approaching a situation where things have been done a certain way for forever and change needs to happen, there are going to be difficult and uncomfortable times. That was 15 years of my career. I felt like I needed to fully be who I am and not bend to fit what I thought they wanted or what I’m seeing in front of me, which I will never be able to be because I’m not a white woman. So my relationship with the company, with my artistic director, with the dancers in the company has evolved through that time. It took a lot of patience.</p><p><strong>When you go onstage for your last performance in the fall, what do you hope you’ll feel in that moment?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>I don’t have hopes and dreams for what’s going to happen that night. I think that I’m going to go out there feeling in control of the decision that I’ve made, the pieces that I am choosing to dance, the shape I’m going to be in. I only have control over so much. So I want to allow myself the freedom to do what feels right and feels good.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/magazine/misty-copeland-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.

One mom had to remind her 8-year-old boys that it’s illegal for her to leave them home alone. So summer often brings a scramble to find child care. But babysitting, especially for more than one child, can be much cheaper than a summer full of camps.</p><p><strong>Do you have kids? What are they doing?</strong></p><p>Last summer, my daughter, now 7, attended seven different day camps in Manhattan. (We showed up at the wrong camp only once.)

The book covers the massacre, but dwells in the lead-up, with a focus on the history of the Methodist church in the South.

In our conversation, she announced that she was retiring after a groundbreaking 25 years. We talked about the obstacles she has overcome, the value of diversity and why she’s ready to move on from this stage of her career.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p><strong>You’ve been ramping down dancing for a while. Why does now feel like the time to make an official retirement announcement?</strong></p><p>In all honesty, I’ve wanted to fade away into the background, which is not really possible. The legacy of what I’ve created, the way that I’m carrying so many stories of Black dancers who have come before me — I can’t just disappear. There has to be an official closing to my time at American Ballet Theater, this company that has meant everything to me.</p><p><strong>You’ve expressed your gratitude toward A.B.T., and at the same time you talk about feeling stifled or thwarted there.</strong></p><p>Whenever you’re approaching a situation where things have been done a certain way for forever and change needs to happen, there are going to be difficult and uncomfortable times. That was 15 years of my career. I felt like I needed to fully be who I am and not bend to fit what I thought they wanted or what I’m seeing in front of me, which I will never be able to be because I’m not a white woman. So my relationship with the company, with my artistic director, with the dancers in the company has evolved through that time. It took a lot of patience.</p><p><strong>When you go onstage for your last performance in the fall, what do you hope you’ll feel in that moment?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>I don’t have hopes and dreams for what’s going to happen that night. I think that I’m going to go out there feeling in control of the decision that I’ve made, the pieces that I am choosing to dance, the shape I’m going to be in. I only have control over so much. So I want to allow myself the freedom to do what feels right and feels good.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/magazine/misty-copeland-interview.html" title=""><em>Read more of the interview here</em></a><em>.
