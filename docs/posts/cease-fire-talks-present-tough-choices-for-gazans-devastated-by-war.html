But the view among some Gazans on that point is less clear-cut.</p><p>Their lives have been devastated after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">almost a year of war</a> and they say they find the idea of Israeli soldiers staying on — and of the checkpoints becoming permanent — disturbing. But if that helps bring an end to the war, it is a price they are willing to pay. Other Gazans expressed serious misgivings about allowing an Israeli military presence in Gaza, and some opposed it outright.</p><p>“Of course I do not accept the presence of checkpoints on our return to the north,” said Mohammad Qadoura, 40, who was displaced from his home in Gaza City. “But if this would lead to the end of the war, I would reluctantly agree.”</p><p>Abdul Aziz Said, 33, a social worker from central Gaza, said that if an Israeli presence in the territory was “what it takes to end this war, I would totally agree.” He added, “I want this war to come to an end now and at any cost.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel has said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-egypt-border-cease-fire.html" title="">presence of its soldiers in Gaza</a> after a permanent cease-fire is necessary to prevent Hamas from regrouping and weapons from being smuggled across the territory. In particular, Israel wants some Israeli troops to patrol part of the Egypt-Gaza border because it believes Egypt has not done enough to prevent Hamas from smuggling arms. And Israel believes that having Israeli troops within Gaza would aim to prevent Hamas fighters from going back en masse to regroup in the northern part of the enclave.</p><p>The latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-talks-cairo.html" title="">high-level effort to reach a cease-fire</a> agreement in Gaza ended on Aug. 25, with Israel and Hamas, the group that governs the enclave, remaining far apart on several critical issues. One of those, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, is whether Israeli forces will remain on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, and if so, how many.</p><p>This has emerged as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/middleeast/what-is-the-philadelphi-corridor.html" title="">crucial issue</a>. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel considers an Israeli military presence in the area, which Israel calls the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/world/middleeast/what-is-the-philadelphi-corridor.html" title="">Philadelphi Corridor</a> and Egypt calls Salah Al Din, vital to preventing Hamas from rearming after the war or rebuilding tunnels to Egypt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>United Nations vehicles driving along a border strip between Gaza and Egypt in January.

Egypt says that keeping Israeli troops in the Philadelphi Corridor would raise national security concerns and be unacceptable to the Egyptian public.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Additionally, Israeli forces have built a security road, which they call the Netzarim corridor, that cuts across Gaza from east to west. Israeli officials have said that they want troops to keep patrolling that road, through which Palestinians must travel between the north and south of Gaza. While the negotiators haggle over the terms of a cease-fire, nine Gazans said in interviews with The New York Times in recent days that they were mainly concerned about getting home safely after multiple displacements and months of relentless bombardment.</p><p>Israel operates a number of checkpoints across Gaza that are often mobile and temporary. Many Gazans say they fear that the checkpoints will become permanent or expand if a cease-fire deal is reached that includes the Israeli demands.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/gaza-evacuation-israel-war.html" title="">repeated Israeli evacuation orders</a> and moved from the north to the south since the war began. For many, returning home could mean confronting Israeli troops and passing through the Netzarim corridor, where they could be subjected to searches, interrogations and arrest.</p><p>Even though growing numbers of Gazans appear to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israel-war.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">fault Hamas</a> for its role in starting the war and helping to bring death and destruction upon them, they blame Israel first and foremost.</p><p>Mohamed al-Sek, 44, a teacher and father of four from Gaza City who was displaced to central Gaza, said that he was not concerned about passing through Israeli checkpoints or being searched.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He said that only those affiliated with Hamas should be worried. “My priority is to return to my home in Gaza City and restore my old life,” Mr. al-Sek said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A tent camp in Khan Younis in August.
