He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news/vance-whose-views-have-clashed-with-the-popes-spends-holy-week-in-rome?smid=url-share" title="">attended the Good Friday service in St. Peter’s Basilica</a>. On Saturday, Mr. Vance met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, and with Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican’s foreign minister.</p><p>Mr. Vance had not been expected to meet the pope, who only recently left the hospital after spending five weeks there in serious condition. The pope has made unannounced appearances since his hospital stay, but his health tightly restricts his planned engagements.</p><p>“I know you have not been feeling great but it’s good to see you in better health,” Mr. Vance told the pope, according to video footage of the visit. An aide to the pope handed Mr. Vance gifts, including three chocolate Easter eggs for his children, a tie with the Vatican’s emblem and rosaries. “I pray for you every day,” Mr. Vance told the pope before he left.</p><p>The two met at Casa Santa Marta, the pope’s residency, as the Sunday mass continued in St. Peter’s Square with a cardinal presiding over the liturgy in place of Francis. The pope later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/europe/pope-francis-easter.html" title="">appeared</a> on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica, waved at the tens of thousands gathered below, and wished them a happy Easter.</p><p>In a message read to the crowds by an aide in St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis reiterated his condemnation of anti-immigrant positions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants!” he wrote.</p><p>Before entering the hospital, the pope, a staunch advocate for migrants and refugees, had directed a sharp critique toward President Trump over his administration’s immigration policy, saying that deporting people who come from difficult situations violates the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families.”</p><p>In those remarks, the pope appeared to give a riposte to Mr. Vance, who has defended the deportation policies by referring to the Christian concept of “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-catholic-theology-migration-e868af574fb2e742c6ed3d756c569769" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordo amoris</a>” — which he defined as a hierarchy of duties that prioritizes immediate obligations to one’s family or community over more distant needs. “The true ordo amoris that must be promoted” is “love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,” Francis wrote in his open letter to American bishops.</p><p>Speaking at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in February, Mr. Vance acknowledged the pope’s critical comments, but said he would continue to express his views.</p><p>During the meeting between Mr. Vance and the Vatican officials on Saturday, “there was an exchange of opinions” on “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” among other issues, according to a statement from the Vatican.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
