But Mr. Biden won 90 percent of Black voters to capture the White House by narrow margins in 2020, and the drop-off for Ms. Harris, if it holds, is large enough to imperil her chances of winning key battleground states.</p><p>Democrats have been banking on a tidal wave of support from Black voters, drawn by the chance to elect the first Black female president and by revulsion toward former President Donald J. Trump, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-harris-race.html" title="">questioning of Ms. Harris’s racial identity</a>, comments on “Black jobs” and demonizing of Haitian immigrants pushed his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/us/politics/trump-haley-racially-charged-attacks.html" title="">long history of racist attacks</a> to the forefront of the campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-1"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Ms. Harris is no doubt on track to win an overwhelming majority of Black voters, but Mr. Trump appears to be chipping away broadly at a longstanding Democratic advantage. His campaign has relied on targeted advertising and sporadic outreach events to court African American voters — especially Black men — and has seen an uptick in support. About 15 percent of Black likely voters said they planned to vote for the former president, according to the new poll, a six-point increase from four years ago.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Much of the erosion in support for Ms. Harris is driven by a growing belief that Democrats, who have long celebrated Black voters as the “backbone” of their party, have failed to deliver on their promises, the poll showed. Forty percent of African American voters under 30 said the Republican Party was more likely to follow through on its campaign commitments than Democrats were.</p><p>“They sweep table scraps off the table like we’re a trained dog and say, ‘This is for you,’” LaPage Drake, 63, of Cedar Hill, Texas, just outside Dallas, said of the Democratic Party. “And we clap like trained seals.”</p><p>Mr. Drake, who owns a tree removal service, said he would back Mr. Trump.</p><p>“Regardless of how people call him racist and stuff, he is for the country of America,” Mr. Drake said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="black-voters-demog" data-id="100000009758150" data-source-id="100000009758150"><div data-sourceid="100000009758150" id="embed-id-100000009758150">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The vice president’s support from Black women is strong, about 83 percent. Twelve percent of Black women said they would back Mr. Trump, with 5 percent undecided. But the slip from Mr. Biden’s 2020 numbers among Black men is striking; 70 percent said they would vote for Ms. Harris in November, down from 85 percent in 2020. This is in line with the gender gap more broadly, but relatively new among Black voters.</p><p>Still, despite Mr. Trump’s continuing efforts to convince African American voters that they were better off during his presidency, more Black voters now, than in February, say the policies of the Biden-Harris administration have helped them.</p><p>Substantially fewer now say that Mr. Trump’s policies helped them.</p><p>In Pittsburgh on Thursday night, former President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/obama-harris-pittsburgh-democrats.html" title="">appealed directly to Black men</a> who might be on the fence about supporting Ms. Harris, suggesting that many “just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president” and reminded them that the “women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time.”</p><p>Allies of Ms. Harris point to her work as vice president to lower Black unemployment, stabilize health care costs and increase funding for historically Black colleges and universities as examples of a concerted and measurable effort to deliver for Black communities. In recent interviews, Ms. Harris has said that she knows it is not a foregone conclusion that African American voters will flock to her campaign.</p><p>In an effort to reach these voters, Ms. Harris’s campaign has started a tour of historically Black colleges and universities, and will begin a push to engage Black faith voters in battleground states over the weekend. Ms. Harris has also sought to engage Black men through surrogate events and nontraditional media interviews, including a recent appearance on the podcast “All the Smoke,” hosted by the former professional basketball players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The vice president is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/harris-breakfast-club-charlamagne-tha-god.html" title="">scheduled to attend a town-hall-style event in Detroit</a> on Tuesday hosted by the morning radio program “The Breakfast Club,” one of the show’s hosts, Charlamagne Tha God, said on Friday. The nationally syndicated show is popular with Black millennials.</p><p>African American voters do have a far more favorable view of Ms. Harris personally than of Mr. Trump; 75 percent said Ms. Harris would do a better job handling the issues important to them personally. Only 17 percent said Mr. Trump would.</p><p>“She’s more capable of doing the job than he is, I feel,” said William Cox, 47, a truck driver in Greensboro, N.C. “She stands more for what betters my family.”</p><p>But on specific issues, Black voters were divided. Fifty-six percent said the United States should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems at home, a position more reflective of Mr. Trump’s views than Ms. Harris’s. Forty percent of Black voters favor Mr. Trump’s border wall, and 41 percent support deporting immigrants in the country illegally, something <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/trump-deportations-migrants-ohio-colorado.html" title="">Mr. Trump has said he will do</a> en masse. That is fewer than the 52 percent who oppose that proposal but still a substantial piece of the Black electorate.</p><p>Mr. Trump, closing out his campaign with increasingly nativist rhetoric and scare tactics, frequently invokes a false picture of crime running rampant in the nation’s cities, driven by undocumented immigrants. In fact, violent crime in U.S. cities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/briefing/us-crime-rate.html" title="">has fallen</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But 47 percent of African American voters, a plurality, said crime in big cities had gotten out of control, seemingly siding with Mr. Trump’s portrayals. Forty-two percent agreed with a more moderate phrasing of the issue: Crime is a major problem in big cities, but it is not out of control.</p><p>Crime rates, especially murder rates, are, in fact, improving in most major cities after the coronavirus pandemic surge in the final year of Mr. Trump’s term, statistics show.</p><p>Black voters, however, have softened their view of Mr. Biden’s time in office. In February, more African American voters said Mr. Biden’s policies had hurt them than said they had helped them, by 25 percentage points. Views are now reversed, and Black voters are 23 percentage points more likely to say Mr. Biden’s policies had helped them, a potential edge for Ms. Harris as she tries to make her case.</p><p>At the same time, views of Mr. Trump’s time in office have turned more sour since February. Black voters are now twice as likely to say Mr. Trump’s policies had hurt them than to say they had helped them; in February, Black voters were split on the question.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-12"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="black-voters-party" data-id="100000009758152" data-source-id="100000009758152"><div data-sourceid="100000009758152" id="embed-id-100000009758152">

Nearly three-quarters of Black voters rated the economy fair or poor, and the economy along with abortion were rated their most pressing concerns. More than seven in 10 Black voters said they had cut back on groceries because of cost; 56 percent said they had cut back often.</p><p>Fully 78 percent of Black voters said race still posed significant obstacles to getting ahead, and of that figure, 21 percent said the Democratic Party had no solutions to address the obstacles.</p><p>What could help Ms. Harris, however, is her party’s still-enduring reputation for aiding low-income people of color, which persists among a broad swath of Black voters.</p><p>“Things do get better when we have Democratic presidents,” said Queneshia Baldwin, 34, a home health employee in Norwood, N.C., who added that she would vote for Ms. Harris. “I think it’s more so the problem is with Republicans.”</p><p>Christine Zhang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p><hr/><p>Here are the key things to know about this poll:</p><ul><li><p>Interviewers spoke with 589 Black voters from Sept. 29 to Oct. 6, 2024, as part of a poll of the nation.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Times/Siena polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish.
