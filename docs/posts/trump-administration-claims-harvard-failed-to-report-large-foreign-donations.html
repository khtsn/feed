    <h1>Trump Administration Claims Harvard Failed to Report Large Foreign Donations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Harvard has filed Section 117 reports for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law,” he said in a statement.</p><p>The records request is the latest instance of the Trump administration singling out Harvard for special scrutiny or punishment in recent weeks as it cracks down on institutions of higher learning over diversity and equity initiatives and what it called a failure to address antisemitism on campuses.</p><p>Because Harvard refused to accede to the requirements to overhaul policies and departments and reconfigure them to mirror the administration’s priorities, federal officials punished the university by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">freezing $2.2 billion in federal grants</a> and are threatening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-irs-harvard.html" title="">revoke the institution’s tax-exempt status</a>.</p><p>Complying with the administration’s latest request could be a significant undertaking.</p><p>Harvard, by its own numbers, has more than 69,000 alumni who live outside the United States, in 202 countries. All of them are likely to have been solicited by the university for donations. Since Harvard technically cancels the credentials of any student who departs campus, whether by graduating or through expulsion, it is conceivable that the Trump administration’s demand for records could apply to nearly all of them.</p><p>The size of Harvard’s network of visiting scholars who are from or now reside in other countries was not immediately clear.</p><p>Vimal Patel<!-- --> contributed reporting</p></div></div>
