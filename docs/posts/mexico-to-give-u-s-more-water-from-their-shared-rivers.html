    <h1>Mexico to Give U.S. More Water From Their Shared Rivers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But fulfilling the agreement is expected to significantly strain Mexico’s farmlands and could revive civil unrest triggered by previous water payments to the United States. Much of the Mexican borderlands are enduring extreme drought conditions, according to <a href="https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/es/climatologia/monitor-de-sequia/monitor-de-sequia-en-mexico" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico’s meteorological agency and water commission</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/conagua_mx/status/1853879584988766651" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico’s water reserves are at historic lows</a>.</p><p>Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has taken a conciliatory approach in negotiations with the Trump administration. Hours after Mr. Trump’s threat of tariffs over the water dispute earlier this month, Ms. Sheinbaum acknowledged that her country had fallen short of its treaty commitments, citing the extreme drought and saying that Mexico had been complying “to the extent of water availability.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/04/welcoming-mexicos-water-deliveries-to-the-united-states-and-steps-to-meet-1944-water-treaty-requirements/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Monday, the State Department lauded Ms. Sheinbaum “for her personal involvement” in negotiating the agreement, and spoke of “water scarcity affecting communities on both sides of the border.” <a href="https://www.gob.mx/sre/prensa/mexico-y-los-estados-unidos-anuncian-acuerdo-sobre-las-asignaciones-de-agua-del-rio-bravo-conforme-al-tratado-de-1944" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A statement</a> from the Mexican foreign ministry on the agreement noted that the United States had agreed not to seek a renegotiation of the 1944 water treaty.</p><p>Longstanding tensions over water have simmered between Mexico and the United States. In 2020, those tensions <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-e766fa1e4e3c4387c3ef2b81789eb961" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exploded into violence in Mexico</a>, as farmers rioted and <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-c5feb6170aa6bd7c81cf3d41300fbee0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seized control of a dam in the border region</a> in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the United States.</p><p>Rising temperatures and drought have made the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable.</p></div></div>
