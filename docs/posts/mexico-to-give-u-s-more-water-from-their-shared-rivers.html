temporarily channel more water to the country from their shared rivers, a concession that appeared to defuse a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/world/americas/mexico-water-boquilla-dam.html" title="">diplomatic crisis</a> sparked by yearslong shortages that left Mexico behind on its treaty-bound contribution of water from the borderlands.</p><p>Earlier this month, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/trump-mexico-water-dispute.html" title="">threatened additional tariffs and other sanctions against Mexico</a> over the water debt, amounting to about 420 billion gallons.<span>   </span>In a social media post, Mr. Trump accused Mexico of “stealing” water from Texas farmers by not meeting its obligations under <a href="https://www.ibwc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1944Treaty.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 1944 treaty</a> that mediates the distribution of water from three rivers the two countries share: the Rio Grande, the Colorado and the Tijuana. </p><p>In an agreement announced jointly by Mexico and the United States on Monday, Mexico will immediately transfer some of its water reserves and will give the country a larger share of the flow of water from the Rio Grande through October.</p><p>The concession from Mexico averted the threat of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">more punishing tariffs</a> and diplomatic enmity with the United States amid the rollout of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/americas/trump-mexico-tariffs-sheinbaum.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s new trade policies</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But fulfilling the agreement is expected to significantly strain Mexico’s farmlands and could revive civil unrest triggered by previous water payments to the United States. Much of the Mexican borderlands are enduring extreme drought conditions, according to <a href="https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/es/climatologia/monitor-de-sequia/monitor-de-sequia-en-mexico" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico’s meteorological agency and water commission</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/conagua_mx/status/1853879584988766651" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico’s water reserves are at historic lows</a>.</p><p>Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has taken a conciliatory approach in negotiations with the Trump administration. Hours after Mr. Trump’s threat of tariffs over the water dispute earlier this month, Ms. Sheinbaum acknowledged that her country had fallen short of its treaty commitments, citing the extreme drought and saying that Mexico had been complying “to the extent of water availability.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/04/welcoming-mexicos-water-deliveries-to-the-united-states-and-steps-to-meet-1944-water-treaty-requirements/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Monday, the State Department lauded Ms. Sheinbaum “for her personal involvement” in negotiating the agreement, and spoke of “water scarcity affecting communities on both sides of the border.” <a href="https://www.gob.mx/sre/prensa/mexico-y-los-estados-unidos-anuncian-acuerdo-sobre-las-asignaciones-de-agua-del-rio-bravo-conforme-al-tratado-de-1944" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A statement</a> from the Mexican foreign ministry on the agreement noted that the United States had agreed not to seek a renegotiation of the 1944 water treaty.</p><p>Longstanding tensions over water have simmered between Mexico and the United States. In 2020, those tensions <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-e766fa1e4e3c4387c3ef2b81789eb961" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exploded into violence in Mexico</a>, as farmers rioted and <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-c5feb6170aa6bd7c81cf3d41300fbee0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seized control of a dam in the border region</a> in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the United States.</p><p>Rising temperatures and drought have made the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to data provided by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which mediates water disputes between the two countries, Mexico has <a href="https://ibwcsftpstg.blob.core.windows.net/wad/WeeklyReports/Current_Cycle.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fallen well short</a> of its treaty commitments on water delivery in the last five years. Between October 2020 and October 2024, Mexico provided just over 400,000 acre-feet of water, far less than the roughly 1.4 million acre-feet called for under treaty stipulations. The debt has only grown since.</p><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega<!-- --> contributed reporting from Mexico City.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Cameron is a Times reporter covering Washington, focusing on breaking news and the Trump administration.</p></div><div><p>James Wagner covers Latin America, including sports, and is based in Mexico City.
