Glenn Youngkin of Virginia declared a state of emergency, days ahead of the storm’s arrival, and urged people to avoid traveling on Sunday.</p><p>Cities from Cincinnati to Chicago to St. Louis began the work of pretreating their roads and preparing warming centers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The low-pressure system will push into Denver on Saturday evening with up to an inch or two of snow projected to fall in the metro area overnight. The storm is forecast to strengthen quickly as it exits Colorado and moves into the Central Plains by late Saturday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We’re on the weaker side of it, and then it quickly wraps into a much more potent storm as it gets into Kansas and Nebraska,” said Zach Hiris, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Denver.</p><p>Heavy snowfall whipped up by wind gusts over 40 miles an hour could bring whiteout conditions and blizzard warnings to the Central Plains by Sunday morning. Roads could be “impassible” and drivers could become stranded, the Weather Prediction Center warned.</p><p>The storm will continue its march eastward, reaching Missouri and the Mississippi Valley by late Saturday night and the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys by Sunday.</p><p>The region between central Kansas and Indiana is expected to get at least eight inches of snow from Saturday into Sunday, with additional snow showers potentially lingering into Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Prediction Center said some of the most extreme conditions are likely in places to the north of and running along the Interstate 70 corridor, which passes through St. Louis and Indianapolis.</p><p>Kansas City, Mo., and Topeka, Kan., could pick up eight to 12 inches of snow, and St. Louis three to seven inches.</p><p>“The focus of the heaviest snow will be to the south of Chicago,” said Rich Bann, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.</p><p>Moderate lake-effect snow could also hit the Upper Great Lakes and Lake Erie through Sunday morning, forecasters said.</p><p>The Prediction Center also warned of “significant icing potential” in the mid-South this weekend. Sleet and freezing rain could wreak havoc from eastern Kansas and the Ozarks, stretching east to the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“That rain will freeze on contact and turn to glazing — that’s what sticks to the trees, power lines, roads, cars, car windows, everything,” Mr. Bann said.</p><p>The southern Appalachian Mountains are also at risk of icing on Sunday and Sunday night.</p><p>There was an enhanced risk, the second level out of five, that severe thunderstorms on Sunday could form in parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and bring lightning, wind gusts, hail and tornadoes.</p><p>From Sunday into Monday, the storm is on track to cross the Appalachians and push into the Mid-Atlantic region, including the Washington, D.C., area, along with western Maryland, Northern Virginia, Pennsylvania and Delaware. By daybreak on Monday, snow is expected to fall across the Mid-Atlantic region and continue through the day.</p><p>The storm is arriving at a time when the country is poised to experience what the National Weather Service called a “significant Arctic outbreak.”</p><p>Temperatures are expected to plummet to below average in areas east of the Rocky Mountains, reaching as far south as the Gulf Coast and Florida, with the frigid weather lasting into mid-January.</p><p>Isabella Kwai<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
