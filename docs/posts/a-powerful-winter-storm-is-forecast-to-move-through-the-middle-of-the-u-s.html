Glenn Youngkin of Virginia declared a state of emergency, days ahead of the storm’s arrival, and urged people to avoid traveling on Sunday.</p><p>Cities from Cincinnati to Chicago to St. Louis began the work of pretreating their roads and preparing warming centers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The low-pressure system will push into Denver on Saturday evening with up to an inch or two of snow projected to fall in the metro area overnight. The storm is forecast to strengthen quickly as it exits Colorado and moves into the Central Plains by late Saturday.</p><p>“We’re on the weaker side of it, and then it quickly wraps into a much more potent storm as it gets into Kansas and Nebraska,” said Zach Hiris, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Denver.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Heavy snowfall whipped up by wind gusts over 35 miles an hour could bring blizzard conditions to the Central Plains by Sunday morning.</p><p>Whiteout conditions could make driving “dangerous to impossible” in some areas, the Weather Service warned.</p><p>The storm will continue its march eastward, reaching the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys on Sunday, and the Mid-Atlantic region Sunday night into Monday.</p><p>There was an enhanced risk, the second level out of five, that severe thunderstorms on Sunday could form in parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and bring lightning, wind gusts, hail and tornadoes.</p><p>At least eight inches of snow is predicted for a region stretching between central Kansas and Indiana from Saturday into Sunday, with additional snow showers potentially lingering into Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Weather Prediction Center said some of the most extreme conditions are likely in places to the north of and running along the Interstate 70 corridor, which passes through St. Louis and Indianapolis.</p><p>Moderate lake-effect snow could also hit the Upper Great Lakes and Lake Erie through Sunday morning, forecasters said.</p><p>The geographic scope of the storm was still taking shape on Friday afternoon.</p><p>Rich Bann, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said that while snow was likely to stay south of the Great Lakes, “it may not take that much of a shift, and then maybe Chicago gets more than we’re expecting right now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="0102-temp-small-multiple-embed" data-id="100000009905483" data-source-id="100000009905483"><div slug="0102-temp-small-multiple-embed" data-sourceid="100000009905483" id="embed-id-100000009905483">
