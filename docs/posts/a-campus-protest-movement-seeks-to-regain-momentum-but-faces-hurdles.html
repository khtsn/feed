Inside the gates, students lounged in the sun and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/katrina-armstrong-columbia-president.html" title="">the university’s new interim president</a> served ice cream. The mass show of support for the demonstrators, which caused Columbia to largely shut down its central campus in the spring, was not yet evident.</p><p>Even the day’s boldest disruption, the splashing of <a href="https://x.com/taliaotg/status/1830991006898233600" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">red paint on Columbia’s iconic statue</a>, Alma Mater, was cleaned up by the university within hours. Some had predicted there would be a new encampment on Day 1, but from the administration’s perspective the start of the semester went relatively smoothly.</p><p>School administrators, at Columbia and around the country, have been preparing for this moment all summer. There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/us/politics/college-protests-gaza-election.html" title="">new protest rules and new security measures</a>. At Columbia, only people with valid IDs can enter the main campus. Students who didn’t have one on Tuesday had to wait in long lines. Some grumbled about the inconvenience.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The anti-Israel rhetoric at the protests continued and disturbed some students who walked by. “There is only one solution, intifada revolution,” the protesters chanted.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pro-Palestinian demonstrators marching near Barnard College in New York this week.

A large number of police officers stood nearby. Two protesters were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and obstruction, the police said.</p><p>A long academic year stretches ahead, and the war in Gaza continues. But around the country, there are signs that student protesters will have to rebuild momentum. School administrators are starting out more prepared then they were last fall, when the scale and intensity of protests caught many of them off guard. New students, or those who weren’t on campus last year, are bringing new perspectives.</p><p>Lily Meyers, a Columbia University senior who is Jewish, took last year off and said the new school year already felt different. Still, she was not too concerned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“In New York,” she said, “there’s people saying hateful stuff all the time.”</p><p>For now, it was the logistics of the campus ID checks that most worried her. “It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out in the coming weeks, considering people are hoping to get to classes on time,” she said.</p><p>Other campuses around the country that hosted encampments saw sporadic protest activities as classes resumed, but there were few large disruptions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pro-Palestinian activists gathered on Wednesday for a sit-in outside the class that Mrs. Clinton teaches at Columbia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anvee Bhutani for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At Cornell University, about 150 pro-Palestinian demonstrators, made up of students and community members, rallied on campus last week on the first day of school there. The night before, Day Hall was <a href="https://statements.cornell.edu/2024/20240826-graffiti-response.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vandalized</a>. A group of protesters broke a glass door and spray painted the exterior walls with the phrases, “Israel bombs, Cornell pays” and “Blood is on your hands.”</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://cornellsun.com/2024/08/26/exclusive-pro-palestine-activists-vandalize-day-hall-on-first-day-of-school-and-tell-the-sun-why/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Cornell Daily Sun</a>, the activists behind the graffiti said, “We had to accept that the only way to make ourselves heard is by targeting the only thing the university administration truly cares about: property.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Yet classes have continued, and this Monday about 150 members from the Cornell and Ithaca communities gathered on campus <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_YrVfOPEyI/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to hold a vigil</a> in honor of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/hostages-gaza-what-to-know.html" title="">six Israeli hostages</a> who were found dead in Gaza. No disruptions to that event were reported.</p><p>By Wednesday, the building had been repaired and protesters had dispersed.</p><p>Shivani Vel, 20, a third-year pre-med student, said the climate still felt different. “Obviously the encampment is gone,” she said, “but people still talk about it. It shows how effective a demonstration like that can be.”</p><p>At the University of Pennsylvania, where a pro-Palestinian encampment ended with about 33 arrests, including nine students, last semester, there were no banners, posters or protesters on the College Green on Wednesday morning. The area was partly fenced off with crowd-control barriers hung with “No Trespassing” signs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>College Green at the University of Pennsylvania was partly fenced off on Wednesday with crowd-control barriers hung with “No Trespassing” signs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Pro-Palestinian student groups announced that they would share daily “Updates from Gaza” in front of the school’s Benjamin Franklin statue, the <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/08/penn-prepares-for-protest-new-guidelines" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">student newspaper</a> reported. But several students said on Wednesday that they had not seen any protests so far this semester.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At Harvard University, a group of five professors used chalk and humor on Tuesday to protest new guidelines prohibiting chalked messages on campus walks. “Why do preschoolers have more academic freedom than Harvard students?” <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/9/4/harvard-professors-chalking-protest/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read one</a> message scrawled on the ground.</p><p>But the student convocation ceremony, which is often disrupted by protesters, was uninterrupted on Monday. Pro-Palestinian activists distributed a pamphlet entitled “The Harvard Crimeson” but didn’t shout between speakers, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/9/3/harvard-2024-convocation-ceremony/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Harvard Crimson reported</a>.</p><p>Tighter campus rules may have limited the protests. But curtailing academic freedom and speech too tightly could also cause a backlash, increasing student support for protesters, similar to what happened last semester. Some professors and students are already saying that they are once again facing inappropriate repression for expressing their views.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>At the University of Michigan, a group of around 50 young people gathered for a “die-in” demonstration at the school’s club fair, Festifall, last Wednesday. They sat and laid on the ground chanting, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/us/politics/river-to-the-sea-israel-gaza-palestinians.html" title="">From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free</a>” while holding signs with images of Palestinians killed in Gaza and reading their names. A group of counterprotesters held American and Israeli flags, and recited, “Bring them home.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Four were arrested. They included the 16-year-old child of a university employee who was later treated at the children’s hospital for injuries related to the arrest, said the chair of the Faculty Senate, Rebekah Modrak, who condemned the police response as too aggressive.</p><p>“It was such an overwhelming show of force against unarmed, very peaceful protesters,” said Silke-Maria Weineck, a professor of comparative literature and German studies, who was also there.</p><p>Campus police and administrators noted that none of those arrested were current students. “For more than an hour, they were given multiple warnings that made clear they were blocking pedestrian traffic and violating university policy,” they wrote <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Joint-statement-between-DPSS-and-Public-Affairs.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a>.</p><p>At the University of California, Berkeley, the steps of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/berkeley-carol-christ-protest-free-speech.html" title="">Sproul Hall</a>, the site of last semester’s encampment, were swept clean for the new academic year. Last week, some demonstrators gathered there to protest new University of California guidance to ban encampments and masks worn to disguise protesters’ identities.</p><p>But some students said it felt as if the activism had waned.</p><p>“The momentum ended very quickly,” said Trista Lenford, a junior who is supportive of the pro-Palestinian movement. “The energy shifted. It went away over the summer.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>At Columbia, pro-Palestinian activists gathered on Wednesday for a sit-in outside the class that Hillary Clinton teaches at the School of International and Public Affairs. </p><p>Though their numbers were small, <a href="https://x.com/AnveeBhutani/status/1831385663817839050" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 30 protesters as the class was set to begin</a>, their choice of event guaranteed press coverage to amplify their cause. “Zionists not welcome here,” they chanted. “Columbia, you will see, Palestine will be free.”</p><p>Mrs. Clinton had come to class through a different door. After about two hours, the protesters dispersed.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Julian Roberts-Grmela<!-- -->, <!-- -->Cole Louison<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jon Hurdle<!-- -->, <!-- -->Halina Bennet<!-- -->, <!-- -->Coral Murphy Marcos<!-- --> and Anvee Bhutani.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-otterman">More about Sharon Otterman</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/university-of-michigan">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/university-of-pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/hillary-rodham-clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Colleges and the War in Gaza</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Taming the Protests:</strong> University officials are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/us/universities-campus-protests-rules.html">grasping for new approaches</a> as they brace for renewed protests over the Israel-Hamas war this fall.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flag Defenders Balk at Party</strong>: After fraternity members at the University of North Carolina shielded a U.S. flag from pro-Palestinian protesters, admirers raised $515,000 to throw a “rager” in their honor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/us/unc-israel-gaza-protests-party-alpha-epsilon-pi.html">Some don’t want it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Shutdown at Michigan:</strong> After pro-Palestinian protesters won elections to take control of the University of Michigan’s student government, they have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/umich-gaza-protests-student-government.html">refused to fund campus groups unless their divestment demands are met</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Back in Class: </strong>Most of the Columbia University students who were arrested or disciplined during pro-Palestinian protests in April <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/columbia-student-arrests-discipline.html">can return to campus this fall</a>, though some of them could still face consequences.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Fall of Columbia’s President</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Nemat Shafik was vilified on almost all sides for her handling of the protests over the Israel-Hamas war. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/columbia-president-nemat-shafik.html">Here are the details of what led up to her resignation</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
