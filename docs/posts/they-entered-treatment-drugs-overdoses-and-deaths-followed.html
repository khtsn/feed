She relapsed after a month. Roommates kicked in doors, flooded the bathroom and sold drugs out of their unit. Even some of the house managers got high, residents said.</p><p>On Sept. 5, after nearly two years in the program and with nowhere else to go, she sent a desperate text message to a former counselor. “I feel so helpless and alone,” wrote Ms. Vlakos, 34. Two weeks later, she died of an overdose.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>PHA Healthcare, the company whose program Ms. Vlakos entered, collects millions of dollars a year to treat hundreds of people struggling with addiction. But many of its patients have not gotten better. Instead, placed by the company in what are effectively government-funded drug houses, they have relapsed, fallen deeper into addiction and sometimes died, an investigation by The New York Times and The Baltimore Banner has found.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Vlakos’s mother, Angela, held back tears while speaking at a memorial service last month in Orchard Beach, Md.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Baltimore’s drug epidemic is the deadliest ever seen in a major American city. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/baltimore-opioid-epidemic-od-deaths.html" title="">Times/Banner examination</a> in May showed that top city officials reacted with little urgency as the death rate mounted, letting key public health efforts stall.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But state health authorities have also made missteps. Trying to entice more providers into the drug treatment field, they poured money into recovery programs, barely vetted a flood of new operators and halted most in-person inspections. Providers who used unscrupulous practices joined the treatment system, diverting patients from longstanding companies.</p><p>The operators of PHA Healthcare had no significant experience providing drug treatment. But they built a multimillion-dollar business that appears to rely on a practice health officials described as both illegal and increasingly common in Baltimore: trading housing for treatment money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The company rents apartment buildings, then offers free rooms to people — many of them homeless — if they attend its group counseling sessions. By taking no government money for housing, the business avoids the state’s strict rules for regulated recovery facilities. But Medicaid pays more than $3,000 per patient for counseling each month. That has amounted to $15 million since PHA Healthcare opened in 2020, including $8.5 million last fiscal year alone.</p><p>Its counseling sessions, however, are offered only online and often involve watching irrelevant videos and answering repetitive questions for hours, some patients said. In recent months, they said, many sessions have been led by unlicensed counselors who logged in from Nigeria. Participants sometimes connect while visibly high.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The apartment complex in West Baltimore where Ms. Vlakos lived. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Many of the apartment complexes are poorly maintained and ridden with drugs and crime. Residents are often overseen by untrained house managers, who have regularly ignored positive drug tests and overdoses. One even sold drugs to the patients, residents said.</p><p>PHA Healthcare’s founder, Stephen Thomas, said not all the people it housed were also in the company’s treatment. But 16 current or former patients said they understood the program to entail a clear exchange when they enrolled: To get a free place to live, they needed to attend the counseling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Times/Banner investigation — drawing on interviews with dozens of current or former clients, employees and state officials, as well as reviews of public records — showed that checking in to the company’s care did not protect some of its patients from dire consequences.</p><p>Reporters traced the deaths of at least 13 people to PHA Healthcare since 2022 — more than some other treatment providers said was typical. The dead include Ms. Vlakos; a 47-year-old house manager; a 45-year-old grandfather of six; and a 43-year-old former federal procurement contractor who had struggled with alcoholism before starting to use opioids.</p><p>The contractor, Fernando Rivera-Estrada, called his mother in January 2023 after less than a month in the program. “If I don’t get out of Baltimore,” he said, “I’m going to die.” He fatally overdosed on fentanyl the next day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Rivera-Estrada’s mother and sister walked through a park near their home in Montgomery Village, Md.

The woman, a patient in the treatment program, had died of cardiovascular disease worsened by chronic drug use. Her baby starved to death.</p><p>They were discovered by a maintenance man in February only after neighbors urged him to look in on the apartment. No one from the program had seen the family for two weeks, according to a medical examiner’s report.</p><p>More than a year earlier, state regulators learned that PHA Healthcare had been operating with an expired license for almost two years and told the company to stop treating patients. But the state then allowed it to obtain a new license, using a different address, and kept paying it, a Health Department spokesman said. Since then, the company has had its most profitable, and deadliest, years.</p><p>Told some of these details in an interview, Maryland’s health secretary, Dr. Laura Herrera Scott, said conditions at PHA Healthcare sounded “just horrifying.”</p><p>“That’s not the care that we want to provide for anyone,” she said.</p><p>The state does not disclose information about serious incidents — including overdoses and deaths<strong><em> </em></strong>— at drug treatment programs, and Dr. Herrera Scott declined to say whether the Maryland Health Department had ever investigated the company. The state halted new license applications this year and stepped up inspections for the types of outpatient treatment programs that are most often associated with unregulated housing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An excerpt from a 2022 state regulatory letter telling PHA Healthcare that its license was suspended. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maryland Department of Health</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>After repeated requests for comment on the findings of the article, a spokeswoman for Mr. Thomas responded on Thursday that many of the statements about the company were “completely false” or “taken out of context.” But she said she would need a couple of weeks to answer questions about the company.</p><p>In an October interview, Mr. Thomas said that stable housing was important to recovery, and that people struggling with addiction deserved to be encouraged — not forced — to get sober. While some clients may have exploited the autonomy the program gives them, many more have used it to lead productive lives, he asserted.</p><p>He said that group counseling sessions were led by interns from other countries who had extensive experience in addiction treatment and advanced degrees, and were working to get licensed in Maryland.</p><p>“I believe we’re the best of the best,” he said. “Do we have shortcomings? Can someone come in with a fine-toothed comb and try to find something that isn’t perfect? I’m sure they can. I stand by what we do here every day.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-1c72f338">Troubling Conditions</h2><p>Faith Schauber and her boyfriend enrolled at PHA Healthcare in fall 2023 and were placed in the same complex where Ms. Vlakos would later die. Multiple times a day, Ms. Schauber walked down the block to buy drugs, she said. She and her boyfriend sometimes got high during group counseling.</p><p>“If our cameras were on, we would, like, step in the hallway, hit our crack pipes or shoot up and then go back to group,” Ms. Schauber, 37, recalled.</p><p>Ms. Schauber, a former Sunday school teacher from Maryland’s rural Eastern Shore, said she had been getting out of a bad relationship in 2015 when she first took a pain pill. That marked the beginning of her addiction to opioids and cocaine. She moved to Baltimore six years ago for treatment but has struggled with frequent relapses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Faith Schauber and her boyfriend enrolled in PHA Healthcare in autumn last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-25"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Schauber in an abandoned rowhouse where she used to do drugs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>She moved to Baltimore six years ago for treatment but has struggled with relapses.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Ms. Schauber and her boyfriend arrived at PHA Healthcare while taking Suboxone, a medication to treat their opioid addiction. When they ran out, their house manager, instead of helping them refill their prescriptions, told her to buy the medication off the street, she said. Unable to afford the black-market price, the couple began using fentanyl offered by roommates.</p><p>Over one 10-day period, Ms. Schauber said, she overdosed six times. Her boyfriend and other patients administered Narcan and called 911. She told the house manager about the overdoses, but no one gave her extra help, she said. She later left the program.</p><p>All 16 patients of PHA Healthcare interviewed by reporters described using drugs in the treatment program or being placed in housing with people who did.</p><p>Three patients said they liked PHA Healthcare and were grateful for a place to live that did not have the same restrictions as other treatment programs, which often enforce strict schedules and require patients to temporarily cut off contact with their family and partners. They attributed any problems to residents they said were only interested in getting high. Another patient, while critical of the business, recounted generous gestures by its leaders, such as helping some patients with moving costs and organizing a free trip to the National Zoo in Washington for families with children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>But all the patients pointed to troubling conditions in the buildings. Police reports, 311 complaints and patients’ text messages detailed thefts, assaults, pests, mildew, power outages, leaks and plumbing problems that forced people to urinate in buckets.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Schauber was placed in the same apartment complex where Ms. Vlakos would later die.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Mr. Thomas said that any housing complaints were quickly addressed and that he sometimes paid for maintenance and pest control out of his own pocket, even though his company did not own the properties.</p><p>The residences — at least 15 in recent years — were mostly scattered across West Baltimore and ranged from a five-building complex to single-family rowhouses. In a text message last year to a former employee, Mr. Thomas said PHA Healthcare housed 300 adults and more than 50 children at a cost of over $200,000 a month. (It also serves some patients elsewhere in the state, Mr. Thomas said.)</p><p>Though the company bills Medicaid for its group sessions, it was not clear that all the people who led them were qualified, patients said. Several of their LinkedIn profiles show they have no prior experience in addiction treatment, and their names do not appear on Maryland’s list of approved counselors or trainees. Some live in other countries, which is unusual, treatment experts said. One seems to have worked as a human resources consultant in Nigeria. Another, also in Nigeria, describes himself as a “public relations enthusiast.” Some patients said it was hard to relate to counselors who lived thousands of miles away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Relapses, overdoses and even deaths happen on occasion at treatment programs; patients with long-term drug addictions often have other health issues, and it is impossible to know whether any person would have survived outside the program. Even so, the number of deaths at PHA Healthcare alarmed representatives of some established drug treatment providers — including large residential programs — who said they had no fatalities in many years, and rarely if ever more than two or three. Bernard Gyebi-Foster, who leads Tuerk House, one of Baltimore’s most prominent programs, said he recalled no more than five patient deaths in 13 years.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ashley Shaw, who died along with her 13-month-old son while at PHA Healthcare, enjoyed chatting on the front stoop of her building. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-34"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Star Halsey lived next door to Ms. Shaw.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Halsey sometimes watched Ms. Shaw’s son, August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jessica Gallagher/The Baltimore Banner, for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>More rigorous programs routinely take precautions that PHA Healthcare did inconsistently. Clients must undergo regular drug tests. Houses are stocked with the overdose-reversal drug Narcan. People caught bringing in narcotics are offered additional treatment or kicked out. Patients can see their counselors in person and are connected with both a mental health professional and a physician who can prescribe medications that curb drug cravings. Some programs check on patients multiple times a day, and even throughout the night.</p><p>At PHA Healthcare, residents said, it is possible to go for weeks without being seen.</p><p>Ms. Shaw, the 32-year-old mother who died, grew up in Baltimore’s Park Heights neighborhood, graduated Edmondson-Westside High School and worked in security, said Dominic Shaw, her brother. In recent years she struggled to find stable housing, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Ms. Shaw was outgoing and enjoyed chatting on the front stoop of her apartment building, her neighbors recalled. But by January, she had been struggling for months, said Star Halsey, who lived in the unit next door and sometimes watched Ms. Shaw’s baby, August. Ms. Shaw stopped cleaning, drank heavily and started covering her windows with cardboard to block out sunlight.</p><p>PHA Healthcare ran only three units in the small building where Ms. Shaw had been placed, and there was no house manager, Ms. Halsey said. When Ms. Shaw stopped coming out of her apartment one day, no one visited her until concerned residents reported a smell wafting through the building.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Footage from a police body camera of the PHA Healthcare-run apartment where Ms. Shaw and her son died.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Baltimore City Police</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>The maintenance man found mother and child lying on a bed in a room cluttered with cardboard boxes, piles of clothes and a crib. The 13-month-old was wearing a green onesie, a pacifier dangling from it.</p><p>According to a medical examiner’s report, Ms. Shaw had tested positive for cocaine two weeks earlier. The report said that was the last time anyone from the company saw her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Mr. Thomas also came to the apartment the morning they were found. He called it one of the worst days of his life. He said it had been days, not weeks, since Ms. Shaw and August had been seen. In the aftermath, he said, he moved families at all of his houses to one complex where a house manager checked on them daily.</p><p>But he did not report the two deaths to health authorities. Because the program offers outpatient services, he said, it is only required to report “treatment-related deaths,” or fatalities that occur while a client is getting counseling. In other words, for the program to inform the state, someone would have to die on a video call.</p><h2 id="link-8fd2261">‘Spinning Out of Control’</h2><p>Long before she and her boyfriend entered PHA Healthcare, Ms. Vlakos grew up in a town south of Baltimore, near the airport. As a girl she rode horses, cared for stray animals and babysat children whose parents came to her church’s 12-step meetings. But she was raped by an acquaintance at age 12, began using heroin in her late teens to dull the trauma and suicidal thoughts, and eventually moved to Baltimore for treatment, then drugs, said her mother, Angela Vlakos.</p><p>After enrolling in PHA Healthcare, Ms. Vlakos filled coloring books with vibrant markers and hung the pages on her walls. She bought zinnia seeds and tried to cultivate an indoor garden before the flowers, barely sprouted, were stolen by other residents.</p><p>One bright spot was Ms. Vlakos’s counselor, Emily Dommartin, who had a master’s degree in social work and was paid $1,200 a week to lead group and one-on-one sessions online. Ms. Dommartin lived in New York, but as many as 60 clients flocked to her Zoom meetings. She held “Goal Wednesdays,” when clients shared their progress toward milestones like getting a driver’s license or seeing a child again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-43"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Vlakos’s counselor, Emily Dommartin, lived in New York.

One texted that she was dealing with an infestation and “the roaches are biting my babies.” Another said that a program staff member had tried to sexually assault her, Ms. Dommartin said.</p><p>Ms. Dommartin grew so concerned that last January, she drove to Baltimore to meet her patients in person. But her bosses brought them to meet her at the program’s headquarters. She believed they did not want her to see how her patients lived, she said.</p><p>A month later, she got a call from Mr. Thomas. He’d heard she had concerns about the program and asked what could be improved, she recalled. She provided a list: The ramshackle housing in drug-ridden communities. The lack of detox services. Irregular drug testing. She said she was fired two days later without explanation.</p><p>Ms. Dommartin kept in touch with Ms. Vlakos, who seemed to be doing well.
