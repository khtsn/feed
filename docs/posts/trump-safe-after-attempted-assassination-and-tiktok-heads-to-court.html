</span>. Full of young rookies new to the top tier of competition, it was up to Sacy, the veteran presence on the team, to help mentor the youngsters and develop them into the world beaters that they would become. LOUD entered the international stage with a bang, where Sacy&#39;s return to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/926/valorant-champions-tour-stage-1-masters-reykjav-k/playoffs" target="_blank">Reykjavík</a> saw him toppling juggernauts from EMEA and NA to make it to the winner&#39;s side of the grand finals. However, LOUD&#39;s inexperience showed when they were swept in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/85530/loud-vs-optic-gaming-valorant-champions-tour-stage-1-masters-reykjav-k-gf" target="_blank">finals</a> by <span data-ref-id="4">

Their problems only seemed to grow worse when they were <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/112285/optic-gaming-vs-loud-valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-copenhagen-elim-a" target="_blank">eliminated</a> in the bottom two of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1014/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-copenhagen/group-stage" target="_blank">Masters Copenhagen</a>, once again at the hands of Optic. However, they returned at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1015/valorant-champions-2022" target="_blank">Champions</a> with a vengeance. After making it out of groups, they would go on to dominate the playoffs bracket. Even Optic, their rivals throughout the year, could not stop them, as LOUD would defeat them 3-1 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/130685/loud-vs-optic-gaming-valorant-champions-2022-gf" target="_blank">grand finals</a> to claim the Champions trophy for Brazil. Sacy himself would put up a dominant performance in the grand finals, with a 1.31 rating across the series to cement his legacy as a Brazilian legend.</p>

<p>Sacy joined Sentinels alongside <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/683/pancada">
		pANcada	</a>
</span> at the beginning of franchising, with the both of them opting to leave behind their Brazilian brothers at LOUD to join the North American organization. They would struggle to deliver on the high expectations set for Sentinels, as their season was plagued with a multitude of issues. Role adjustments, coaching staff changes, and roster swaps made it difficult for Sentinels to find their footing in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1189/champions-tour-2023-americas-league/regular-season" target="_blank">Americas league</a>, as they failed to qualify for any international events.</p>

<p>In the off season before 2024, Sentinels added a new IGL in <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1265/johnqt">
		johnqt	</a>
</span>, as well as replacing Pancada with <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/729/zellsis">
		Zellsis	</a>
</span>, leaving Sacy as the sole Brazilian representative for the North American organization. This new roster showed promise, winning their own <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1868/sentinels-invitational" target="_blank">Sentinels Invitational</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1763/afreecatv-valorant-league" target="_blank">AfreecaTV</a> Valorant League tournament. They followed this up by topping the Americas league at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1923/champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff/playoffs" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> to qualify to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1921/champions-tour-2024-masters-madrid" target="_blank">Masters Madrid</a>, where they would take home their second international trophy, as well as making Sacy the only player to ever win both Champions and a masters event. Following their big win, they would face some turbulence in Stage 1, failing to qualify for the Americas playoffs, but quickly rebounded in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2095/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> and made it to Champions off the back of championship points. At <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions</a>, they would pull off a shocking <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378666/gen-g-vs-sentinels-valorant-champions-2024-decider-b" target="_blank">upset</a> against the Shanghai winners of <span data-ref-id="8">
