We allege that real estate developers and business owners Raizada “Pinky” Vaid and Mayank Dwivedi paid for access and influence to the tune more than $100,000. Lewis-Martin acted as an on-call consultant for Vaid and Dwivedi, serving at their pleasure to resolve whatever issues they had with D.O.B. on their construction projects, and she did so without regard for security considerations and with utter and complete disregard for D.O.B.’s expertise and the public servants who work there.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/19ingrid-charges-htkz/19ingrid-charges-htkz-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Ingrid Lewis-Martin, who resigned as Mayor Eric Adams’s chief adviser, and her son, Glenn D.
