We allege that real estate developers and business owners Raizada “Pinky” Vaid and Mayank Dwivedi paid for access and influence to the tune more than $100,000. Lewis-Martin acted as an on-call consultant for Vaid and Dwivedi, serving at their pleasure to resolve whatever issues they had with D.O.B. on their construction projects, and she did so without regard for security considerations and with utter and complete disregard for D.O.B.’s expertise and the public servants who work there.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/multimedia/19ingrid-charges-htkz/19ingrid-charges-htkz-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Ingrid Lewis-Martin, who resigned as Mayor Eric Adams’s chief adviser, and her son, Glenn D.

Martin II, and the two businessmen. It accuses Ms. Lewis-Martin of using her official position to “illegally influence Department of Buildings and other city decisions” in exchange for the cash and other benefits for her and her son.</p><p>“From the moment Lewis-Martin became the second most senior person in City Hall, she abused her position and sold her influence to enrich herself and her family,” prosecutors said in a narrative of the accusations accompanying the indictment.</p><p>The indictment accuses Ms. Lewis-Martin and her son, Glenn D. Martin II, of accepting financial support from the two men for business ventures, including a clothing line and a Chick-fil-A franchise in exchange for her using her city position to assist with their projects. After the businessmen paid Mr. Martin $100,000 in August 2023, he deposited the money into a joint account he shared with Ms. Lewis-Martin, prosecutors said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The charges were unsealed Thursday and announced at a news conference by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L.
