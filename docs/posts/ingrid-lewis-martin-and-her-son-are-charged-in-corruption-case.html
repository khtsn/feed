Martin II, and the two businessmen. It accuses Ms. Lewis-Martin of using her official position to “illegally influence Department of Buildings and other city decisions” in exchange for the cash and other benefits for her and her son.</p><p>“From the moment Lewis-Martin became the second most senior person in City Hall, she abused her position and sold her influence to enrich herself and her family,” prosecutors said in a narrative of the accusations accompanying the indictment.</p><p>The indictment accuses Ms. Lewis-Martin and her son, Glenn D. Martin II, of accepting financial support from the two men for business ventures, including a clothing line and a Chick-fil-A franchise in exchange for her using her city position to assist with their projects. After the businessmen paid Mr. Martin $100,000 in August 2023, he deposited the money into a joint account he shared with Ms. Lewis-Martin, prosecutors said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The charges were unsealed Thursday and announced at a news conference by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, and the city Department of Investigation commissioner, Jocelyn Strauber.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin, her son and the two businessmen, Mayank Dwivedi and Raizada Vaid, surrendered early Thursday and were to be arraigned later in the day.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
