    <h1>Appeals Court Declines to Block Release of Special Counsel Report on Trump Cases</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But the department has said that it wants to release the other volume, which details Mr. Smith’s decisions in the case he filed in Washington accusing Mr. Trump of seeking to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>In its order on Thursday night, the appeals court left the injunction in place but said that the Justice Department could take further action seeking to appeal it. Still, the injunction, which was issued by Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who oversaw the classified documents case, is scheduled to last only another three days.</p><p>When it expires, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland could go ahead with his plans to release the portion of Mr. Smith’s report concerning the election interference case.</p><p>In the meantime, Mr. Trump’s lawyers could try further to stop or delay the release of the report by asking the Supreme Court to step in.</p><p>Mr. Smith was forced to drop both criminal cases after Mr. Trump won the 2024 election because of a Justice Department policy that sitting presidents should be seen as temporarily immune from prosecution while in office.</p></div></div>
