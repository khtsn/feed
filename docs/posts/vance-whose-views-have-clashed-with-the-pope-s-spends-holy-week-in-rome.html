John Sauer asked the justices to “dissolve” the administrative stay they had issued early Saturday that blocked the deportations while they considered the application, and to allow lower courts to weigh in before intervening further in the case.</p><div><p>The deportations remain paused while the justices consider the matter. In emergency applications, the Supreme Court can act at any time.</p><p>In his filing, Mr. Sauer called the request by lawyers for the migrants that the justices step in “fatally premature” and argued that they had “improperly skipped over the lower courts.”</p><p>He said that the government had provided advance notice to detainees subject to imminent deportation and that they “have had adequate time to file” claims challenging their removal. Mr. Sauer added that the government had agreed it would not deport any detainees with pending claims.</p><p>The 17-page court filing came hours after a rare overnight ruling by the justices, who in a one-page, unsigned order had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-deportations-venezuelans-el-salvador.html" title="">blocked the Trump administration from deporting the migrants</a>.</p><p>It was the latest twist in a fast-moving, high-stakes legal battle over the administration’s efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a violent gang.</p><p>On Friday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union mounted challenges in lower courts to prevent what they claimed was the imminent removal of Venezuelans who were scheduled to be flown out of the country from a detention center in Texas.</p><p>The lawyers then filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court, asking it to step in and temporarily block the deportations to protect the detainees as part of a proposed class action. The A.C.L.U. lawyers asked the court to move swiftly, claiming that some of the migrants had been loaded onto buses, presumably to be taken to the airport.</p><p>In his filing, Mr. Sauer said the A.C.L.U. had rushed to an appeals court and the Supreme Court without giving lower courts time to consider the case.</p><p>“Nonetheless, without waiting for the government to file its opposition brief and after giving the district court just 42 minutes to rule, applicants immediately sought emergency relief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and then in this court,” he wrote.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In emergency applications, the Supreme Court can act at any time.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In their overnight order, the justices used formal language to request a response from the government. “The solicitor general is invited to file a response to the application before this court as soon as possible,” they wrote.</p><p>Mr. Sauer argued that the migrants had been given “adequate” notice of the government’s intent to deport them. He did not directly address claims by the A.C.L.U. that some of the notices were in English only, saying that “a detainee’s language ability or his family’s pre-existing relationship with a lawyer may well be relevant to a court’s determination of the adequacy of a particular notice.”</p><p>He also did not directly address the accusations that migrants might have been on buses and heading to the airport. The A.C.L.U. was “speculating” that migrants would be “removed imminently, before their claims can be further tested,” Mr. Sauer wrote.</p><p>He also pushed back against the group’s argument that the justices should protect the detainees as part of a proposed class action. The government had argued that the determination of whether a detainee under the Alien Enemies Act was entitled to court relief was “inherently too individualized” to treat them all as a class.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FkNjFmN2JkLWU5ZWMtNWYxZC04MDMyLWIyMTUzNzkxZWVjYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#three-pentagon-officials-fired-in-leak-inquiry-proclaim-their-innocence" data-source-id="100000010119967"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/greg-jaffe"><img alt="Greg Jaffe" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-19T23:26:33.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 19, 2025, 7:26 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/greg-jaffe" itemprop="name">Greg Jaffe</a></p><p>Reporting from Washington</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FkNjFmN2JkLWU5ZWMtNWYxZC04MDMyLWIyMTUzNzkxZWVjYw=="><a href="#three-pentagon-officials-fired-in-leak-inquiry-proclaim-their-innocence">Three Pentagon officials fired in leak inquiry proclaim their innocence.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Pentagon in Washington in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valerie Plesch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Three top Pentagon officials who were accused of leaking unauthorized information this week and escorted out of the Pentagon issued a statement on Saturday proclaiming their innocence.</p><p>Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick and Colin Carroll served as senior advisers to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/pentagon-leak-investigation.html?" title="">before they were fired</a>.</p><div><p>“Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door,” the three wrote in a highly unusual joint statement <a href="https://x.com/dandcaldwell/status/1913701312929149363?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on social media.</p><p>The three all served in uniform.

Katie Hobbs of Arizona vetoed a bill on Friday that would have supported the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts by requiring state and local officials to cooperate with federal immigration officials.</p><p>Under the <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1R/bills/SB1164S.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legislation</a>, state and local officials would not have been able to restrict cooperation with federal officials on immigration enforcement or to block the use of federal resources and grant funds to help with such efforts. It also would have required them to assist with immigration detainers, or requests from the federal government to hold certain people in custody until Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials can pick them up.</p><div><p>In a <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/44a5186aac69c13c570fca36a/files/43eb542e-d4bc-82a9-84eb-a9a017b75d40/04182025160327_0001.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> explaining her veto, Governor Hobbs, a Democrat, said, “Arizonans, not Washington, D.C., politicians, must decide what’s best for Arizona.”</p><p>“I will continue to work with the federal government on true border security, but we should not force state and local officials to take marching orders from Washington, D.C.,” she added in the letter, addressed to Warren Petersen, the State Senate president.</p><p>Mr. Petersen, who sponsored the bill, called the measure “a vital action to help safeguard our communities” after legislators passed it earlier this month. He and other state Republican leaders were not available for comment on the veto on Saturday. </p><p>State Republicans had branded the bill as a necessary measure to “uphold the rule of law” against illegal immigration, arguing that anything short of it would be an affront to those who came to the country legally. </p><p>But state Democrats argued that the measure could lead to racial profiling and compromised due process rights. The Arizona House Democrats thanked the governor for vetoing the measure in a <a href="https://x.com/AZHouseDems/status/1913401608274399297" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement posted on X</a>.</p><p>It was not clear whether legislators would try to override the veto. They would need a two-thirds majority.</p><p>Governor Hobbs’s veto comes as the Trump administration has ramped up its crackdown on immigration and as states across the country grapple with how, and whether, to cooperate with federal officials.</p><p>Because states have the ability to decide whether or not to work with them, there has been a patchwork of bills on this matter that have passed or are working through state legislatures.</p><p>In Florida, for instance, state lawmakers passed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/immigration-florida-desantis-feud-republicans.html" title="">measures</a> that take a harder stance on immigration, including one that set aside $250 million for local police departments to help federal officials. And in Alabama, the State House passed a bill this week that would empower local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.</p><p>But in Colorado, the State Senate recently <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-lawmakers-advance-bill-block-local-cooperation-ice-no-warrant/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved a bill</a> that would limit local governments’ cooperation with federal officers.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M3MTVkY2U2LTU5MGUtNTIzOC04NzY1LWFhOTI4NzhjYTZmMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#alien-enemies-act-timeline" data-source-id="100000010119841"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tim-balk"><img alt="Tim Balk" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-tim-balk/author-tim-balk-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-tim-balk/author-tim-balk-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-tim-balk/author-tim-balk-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-19T21:08:22.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 19, 2025, 5:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tim-balk" itemprop="name">Tim Balk</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M3MTVkY2U2LTU5MGUtNTIzOC04NzY1LWFhOTI4NzhjYTZmMg=="><a href="#alien-enemies-act-timeline">Here’s a timeline of the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump in the Oval Office this week.

The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-deportations-venezuelans-el-salvador.html?" title="">court’s latest order</a>, which came around 1 a.m. on Saturday, blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas hours after the American Civil Liberties Union said the Trump administration was preparing to expel them without due process.</p><div><p>At times, the Trump administration has been accused of disregarding judicial orders as it proceeds with its immigration policies and deportation efforts, deepening legal scholars’ concern that the country could be facing a constitutional crisis.</p><p>Here is a timeline:</p><p><strong>March 14:</strong> The Trump administration issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> invoking the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alien Enemies Act</a>, but the order was not immediately made public. The proclamation said that the government was targeting the violent Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua, which it said was threatening an invasion of the United States. The Alien Enemies Act allows the government to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-8/clause-11%E2%80%9314/enemy-aliens" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detain and expel immigrants</a> age 14 or older without a court hearing when the United States is invaded or at war. It is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-alien-enemies-act-history.html" title="">fourth time</a> the law has been invoked in American history.</p><p><strong>March 15:</strong> Fearing that the Trump administration was preparing to immediately expel Venezuelans in custody without hearings, the A.C.L.U. filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/j-g-g-v-trump?document=COMPLAINT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> in federal court in Washington seeking to block the president from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/alien-enemies-act-trump.html" title="">invoking</a> the law. The same day, the administration published the executive order. In a hastily scheduled virtual hearing, a federal judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg, was told by the A.C.L.U. that planes were leaving the United States with Venezuelans. He ordered the government not to deport anyone under the law and to return any planes that had already taken off, “however that’s accomplished.”</p><p><strong>March 16</strong>: On social media,<strong> </strong>El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, published a video of men being led off a plane in handcuffs and taken into a prison in his country. Mr. Bukele posted an article about Judge Boasberg’s order and wrote, “Oopsie… Too late.” The Trump administration insisted it did not violate Judge Boasberg’s order. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement that federal courts “have no jurisdiction” over the president’s handling of foreign affairs.</p><p><strong>March 17: </strong>Judge Boasberg grilled a Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/trump-deportation-flights-hearing.html" title="">lawyer on whether</a> the government had defied his orders. The lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, refused to answer specific questions but maintained that the government had complied. Mr. Kambli suggested that the government was following the judge’s written order, which did not include the demand that any planes already in the air return. “Apparently my oral orders don’t appear to carry much weight,” Judge Boasberg said, appearing frustrated. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/timeline-trump-deportation-flights-el-salvador.html" title="">New York Times review</a> of flight data found that three planes carrying more than 200 migrants continued to El Salvador and that none landed before the judge’s order. Two were already in flight, and one had not yet left American soil until after the judge’s written order was published online.</p><p><strong>March 26: </strong>A federal appeals court kept Judge Boasberg’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/trump-deportations-flight-block-alien-enemies-act.html" title="">block on the Alien Enemies Act in place</a>, denying an appeal by the Trump administration. The vote, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was 2 to 1. Judge Karen L. Henderson wrote that the government had not shown a “likelihood of success on the merits.”</p><p><strong>March 28: </strong>Judge<strong> </strong>Boasberg extended his block on the Alien Enemies Act for another two weeks.</p><p><strong>April 7: </strong>The Supreme Court said in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/07/us/supreme-court-venezuelan-migrants.html" title="">unsigned, three-page order</a> that the Trump administration could continue to deport Venezuelan migrants, for the time being. It imposed constraints on the administration, saying that detainees must receive notice before they are deported and must be allowed to seek a hearing.</p><p><strong>April 16: </strong>Judge Boasberg, still searching for answers about whether his orders were defied in connection to the deportation flights a month earlier, issued a ruling threatening an extraordinary contempt investigation into the Trump administration.</p><p><strong>April 18: </strong>The A.C.L.U. filed court papers in federal court in Washington, saying that Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, had received removal notices. The notices, written in English, did not tell the Venezuelans how to contest their deportation, the filing said. The migrants were put onto buses and told by officers that they would be removed within 24 hours, court papers said. Judge Boasberg held an emergency hearing, but declined to take any action. Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas rejected a request for intervention. The A.C.L.U. also filed an emergency petition to the Supreme Court. (Separately, the appeals court that sits above Judge Boasberg issued a temporary order blocking any contempt proceedings for now.)</p><p><strong>April 19: </strong>At 12:55 a.m., the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order blocking the Trump administration from deporting the Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet facility “until further order of this court.” Two members of the Supreme Court’s six-justice conservative majority, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., dissented. The Venezuelans were returned to the Bluebonnet facility, according to the A.C.L.U. The speed at which the Supreme Court responded and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#supreme-court-orders-in-the-middle-of-the-night-are-rare-these-days" title="">the timing of the order’s release</a> were highly unusual. </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad1"><div id="ad-1" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid2">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QyYjg1NGJkLWQyMjctNWY5YS05YzA1LTI1Y2Q1Mjc2OWY1Nw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#supreme-court-deportation-protocol-venezuela" data-source-id="100000010119847"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-liptak"><img alt="Adam Liptak" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-19T18:31:16.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 19, 2025, 2:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-liptak" itemprop="name">Adam Liptak</a></p><p>Reporting from Washington</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QyYjg1NGJkLWQyMjctNWY5YS05YzA1LTI1Y2Q1Mjc2OWY1Nw=="><a href="#supreme-court-deportation-protocol-venezuela">Urgency of Supreme Court order suggests a skepticism of the Trump administration.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration early Saturday from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>There are sculptures of tortoises scattered around the Supreme Court grounds. They symbolize, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/visiting/activities/pdf/Animals_in_the_Architecture_Oct2021.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the court’s website says</a>, “the slow and steady pace of justice.”</p><p>But the court can move fast when it wants to, busting through protocols and conventions. It did so around 1 a.m. on Saturday, blocking the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members under a rarely invoked 18th-century wartime law.</p><div><p>The court’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041925zr_c18e.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unsigned, one-paragraph order</a> was extraordinary in many ways. Perhaps most important, it indicated a deep skepticism about whether the administration could be trusted to live up to the key part of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an earlier ruling</a> after the government had deported a different group of migrants to a prison in El Salvador.</p><p>That unsigned and apparently unanimous ruling, issued April 7, said that detainees were entitled to be notified if the government intended to deport them under the law, “within a reasonable time,” and in a way that would allow the deportees to challenge the move in court before their removal.</p><p>There were indications late Friday that the administration was poised to violate both the spirit and letter of that ruling. Lawyers for the detainees said their clients were given notices that they were eligible to be deported under the law, the Alien Enemies Act. The notices were written in English, a language many of them do not speak, the lawyers said. And they provided no realistic opportunity to go to court.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, racing against the clock, filed <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1007/356063/20250418172902261_2025.04.18%20AARP%20Application.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its emergency application</a> to the Supreme Court on Friday evening — Good Friday, as it happened — and urged the court to take immediate action to protect the detainees as part of a proposed class action.</p><p>The lawyers told the court that they feared their clients could be deported within hours, saying that some had already been loaded onto buses, presumably to be taken to the airport.</p><p>The Supreme Court did act fast. “The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court,” the order said.</p><p>In a typical case, the Supreme Court would await a ruling from the relevant appeals court, here the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and ask for a response from the administration, on a deadline set by the justices.</p><p>The justices did neither of those things. Instead, their unsigned opinion said: “The matter is currently pending before the Fifth Circuit. Upon action by the Fifth Circuit, the solicitor general is invited to file a response to the application before this court as soon as possible.”</p><p>Inviting rather than ordering the government to respond is standard language. But asking for a response “as soon as possible” is not an instruction longtime observers of the court recognized. It was not tortoise talk.</p><p>On Saturday, Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the Supreme Court to allow lower courts to weigh in and to develop “a proper factual record” before intervening in the case.</p><p>The Fifth Circuit issued <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.224134/gov.uscourts.ca5.224134.14.1.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its ruling</a> in the small hours of Saturday morning, denying the A.C.L.U.’s request for emergency relief as premature.</p><p>It would not have been unusual for a single justice to issue an “administrative stay”— a brief pause — to let the court consider the matter in a more deliberate fashion. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has issued such stays in recent weeks, as a flood of emergency applications related to early moves by the Trump administration have come before the court.</p><p>But each of the nation’s 13 federal circuits is supervised by an assigned justice, and the member of the court responsible for overseeing the Fifth Circuit is Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. He was apparently not inclined to issue a stay on his own. Indeed, the Saturday order noted that both he and Justice Clarence Thomas dissented.</p><p>The court’s order said that Justice Alito would explain his reasoning at some point. That, too, is unusual, as dissenting justices are generally afforded time to issue their opinions along with that of the majority.</p><p>The days to come are likely to be busy ones at the court, which is yet to address the substantial legal questions in the case, including whether the wartime law applies at all, and what the detainees must show to overcome accusations that they are gang members.</p><p>For now, the justices have tried to ensure that those questions can be addressed by federal courts while the people affected are still in the United States.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyZTM3MDViLTE3OGItNTExZC1hMWQ2LTVlNzI1OWU0ZGQ4Zg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#trump-protests-nyc-florida-la" data-source-id="100000010119716"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesus-jimenez"><img alt="Jesus Jiménez" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/reader-center/author-jesus-jimenez/author-jesus-jimenez-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/reader-center/author-jesus-jimenez/author-jesus-jimenez-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/reader-center/author-jesus-jimenez/author-jesus-jimenez-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/minho-kim"><img alt="Minho Kim" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/23/reader-center/author-minho-kim/author-minho-kim-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/23/reader-center/author-minho-kim/author-minho-kim-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/23/reader-center/author-minho-kim/author-minho-kim-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-19T16:59:09.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 19, 2025, 12:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesus-jimenez" itemprop="name">Jesus Jiménez</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/minho-kim" itemprop="name">Minho Kim</a></p><p>Jesus Jiménez reported from Los Angeles, and Minho Kim from Washington. </p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMyZTM3MDViLTE3OGItNTExZC1hMWQ2LTVlNzI1OWU0ZGQ4Zg=="><a href="#trump-protests-nyc-florida-la">Protesters nationwide rallied again to condemn Trump’s policies.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="19trump-news-protests"><div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>Demonstrations against the Trump administration were held in cities throughout the nation.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Thousands of protesters across the country once again took to the streets on Saturday to rally against President Trump and his policies, a sign of sustained resistance to his leadership just two weeks after cities and towns nationwide saw mass demonstrations.</p><p>The turnouts in some places like Washington and Chicago appeared to be smaller than the protests on April 5. Several thousand marched in the nation’s capital on Saturday, compared with tens of thousands earlier this month. Still, more than 700 events were planned from Jacksonville, Fla., to Los Angeles for Saturday, according to one of the organizers, the group 50501, and in New York, marchers in Midtown Manhattan filled 15 blocks on Madison Avenue. </p><div><p>The participants raged against the president, who they say is trampling on civil liberties and the rule of law, and overreaching in immigration, federal job cuts, the economy and other areas.</p><p>In front of the White House, protesters repeatedly shouted a single word.</p><p>“Shame!”</p><p>Thousands more marched from the Washington Monument. Many demonstrators berated the administration for not bringing Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who the courts have said was wrongfully deported to El Salvador, back to the United States. Waving upside-down American flags, they marched along the eight-lane Constitution Avenue, chanting “Bring Kilmar home.” Trump officials have maintained that Mr. Abrego Garcia was a member of the Salvadoran gang MS-13; he denies the claim.<span>    </span></p><p>Julia Fine, a Maryland resident who was holding a sign at the protest by the White House that read “free Garcia,” said the prison in El Salvador where Mr. Abrego Garcia is being held reminded her of “concentration camps.”</p><p>“That’s where we’re headed with this,” she said. </p><p>Concerns over the government’s handling of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case echoed at demonstrations from New York City to Cincinnati to Chicago. </p><p>At the protest in Manhattan, hundreds of signs flew in the air, including one that read: “Due Process.” </p><p>“It’s an injustice,” said Barry Knittle, 64, a manager at an engineering firm who lives in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. “And I fear it’s just the beginning.”</p><p>The crowd chanted, “The people united will never be defeated.” Packed double-decker tour buses passing by honked their horns in support, drawing big cheers.</p><p>Although many of the events on Saturday were traditional protests, many also were intended to unite local communities through activities such as food drives. Mass protests during President Trump’s first term, like the Women’s March in 2017, often focused on a single topic, but demonstrators on Saturday expressed concern on a wide range of issues: federal job cuts, their 401(k)s, veterans’ rights, Social Security, the war in Ukraine, transgender and gay rights, and misinformation on autism and vaccines.</p><p>“Everything here is a big issue,” said Fio Holloman, 22, who attended a rally in Chicago’s Daley Plaza. </p><p>Hundreds of protesters rallied in Fort Worth, at one point shutting down traffic for at least four blocks. Jeannie Walker, 54, couldn’t land on just one issue when asked what brought her to Saturday’s protest. </p><p>“All of it,” she said. </p><p>Aaron Burk, who attended the Washington rally and whose girlfriend took a federal buyout from the Department of Energy, said he was worried that the administration would not stop at deporting undocumented immigrants without due process and would imprison and deport U.S. citizens.</p><p>“Where does it stop?” he said. Mr. Burk added that his daughter is transgender and that he was most concerned about the dehumanization of minorities.</p><p>Hundreds took to the streets in Jacksonville, Fla., to protest a number of causes, including the president’s attacks on the L.B.G.T.Q. community and the government’s desire to alter the Endangered Species Act.</p><p>“We are losing our country,” said one demonstrator, Sara Harvey, 65. In the last few months, she said she had protested the federal job cuts led by Elon Musk and joined the nationwide protests on April 5.</p><p>“I’m worried for my grandchildren,” she said. “I do it for them.”</p><p>In Cincinnati, thousands of people marched peacefully through downtown. Aftab Pureval, the mayor, led the crowd in a chant of “vote them out” and denounced the Trump administration for cutting federal workers, imposing tariffs and mismanaging the economy, saying that everything that working families need will become more expensive.</p><p>For some who attended, like Andrea Mallory, 35, a social worker, the event was akin to a group therapy session.</p><p>“This is good for us emotionally,” she said. </p><p>A celebration in Concord, Mass., to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the beginning of the American Revolution was not part of the organized network of protests, but some people took the occasion to draw parallels between then and now.</p><p>Conan Walter, 65, stood on the Old North Bridge holding a large poster scrawled with the words “Stop fascism now.” </p><p>“This celebration is about us getting out from under the King of England’s authoritarian rule,” Mr. Walter said. “That rule is trying to make a comeback today, and it’s important that people step up against that and meet the challenge.”</p><p>Still, not everyone in Concord was there to protest on Saturday. Deborah Bucknam, 78, an avid Trump supporter and lawyer from northern Vermont, said she felt shut out of the political conversation on Saturday morning. Ms. Bucknam came to Concord to honor American history, and she said political differences shouldn’t overshadow the milestone.</p><p>But she acknowledged that demonstrators were allowed to voice their dissent.<span>  </span></p><p>“Protests are part of the American experience,” she said. “We have a right to protest, but everyone has a right to protest.”</p><p>Robert Chiarito contributed reporting from Chicago; <!-- -->Lila Hempel-Edgers<!-- --> from Concord, Mass.; Mary Beth Gahan from Fort Worth; <!-- -->Nichole Manna<!-- --> from Jacksonville, Fla.; Nate Schweber from New York; and Kevin Williams from Cincinnati. </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad2"><div id="ad-2" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ViMjRmNGRkLWQzZjgtNWYzNi1iMzg5LTcwNzY0M2Y5ZmZmZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#supreme-court-orders-in-the-middle-of-the-night-are-rare-these-days" data-source-id="100000010119750"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-liptak"><img alt="Adam Liptak" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/multimedia/author-adam-liptak/author-adam-liptak-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-19T16:12:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 19, 2025, 12:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-liptak" itemprop="name">Adam Liptak</a></p><p>Reporting from Washington</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ViMjRmNGRkLWQzZjgtNWYzNi1iMzg5LTcwNzY0M2Y5ZmZmZQ=="><a href="#supreme-court-orders-in-the-middle-of-the-night-are-rare-these-days">Supreme Court orders in the middle of the night are rare these days.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Supreme Court’s order over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants was issued at 12:55 a.m. Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A few years ago, late-night orders from the Supreme Court were not particularly unusual.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/us/supreme-court-upholds-texas-voter-id-law.html" title="">arrived around 5 a.m.</a> in 2014, after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stayed up most of the night putting the finishing touches on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/us/supreme-court-upholds-texas-voter-id-law.html" title="">a dissent</a> from an order allowing Texas to use its strict voter ID law.

On Saturday, he met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state.</p><div><p>No meeting was announced with Pope Francis, who recently left the hospital after spending five weeks there in serious condition and has since made few public appearances.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s Catholic faith permeates his socially conservative politics. But since he took office, some of the Trump administration’s policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/pope-trump-immigration-deportations.html" title="">have drawn condemnation</a> from the pope.</p><p>Francis has strongly criticized the Trump administration’s policy of mass deportations and has urged Roman Catholics to reject anti-immigrant sentiments. Mr. Vance has strongly defended that policy, pointing to the medieval Catholic theological concept of “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-catholic-theology-migration-e868af574fb2e742c6ed3d756c569769" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordo amoris</a>,” the idea of a hierarchy of duties that prioritizes immediate obligations to one’s family or community over more distant needs.</p><p>“You love your family, then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world,” Mr. Vance said in an interview with Fox News in January. “A lot of the far left has completely inverted that.”</p><p>The pope seemed to be alluding to Mr. Vance’s argument in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/pope-trump-immigration-deportations.html" title="">a letter</a> he wrote in February to American bishops in which he spoke out against Trump’s policy on migrants.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People watching the motorcade of Vice President JD Vance leave the Vatican after he met with officials there Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In the letter, Francis said, “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.”</p><p>“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted,” Francis wrote, is “love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.”</p><p>Mr. Vance acknowledged the pope’s critical comments, but said he would continue to express his views.</p><p>“I was certainly surprised when he criticized our immigration policy in the way that he has,” Mr. Vance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCY0b1wWX9A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in February. He added that the news media, along with social media influencers and even some Catholics, “try to bring the Holy Father into every culture war battle in American politics.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Vance said that the pope “cares about the flock of Christians” and that he was praying for him.</p><p>During Mr. Vance’s meeting on Saturday with Cardinal Parolin and with Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican’s foreign minister, the officials exchanged opinions on “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” along with other issues, according to a statement from the Vatican.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Vance stood, sat and knelt for two hours in St. Peter’s Basilica, his young daughter sleeping in his arms at one point, as he followed the Liturgy of the Lord’s Passion, during which the faithful are invited to fix their eyes on a statue of the crucified Jesus. Cardinals and bishops proceeded in a line, bent and kissed the statue’s feet.</p><p>Kimberlee Woo-leng, 24, a student from Trinidad and Tobago who also attended the service, said she hoped spending Holy Week in Rome would help Mr. Vance “have mercy.”</p><p>“I hope it strikes his heart,” she said.</p><p>Elizabeth Dias<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad3"><div id="ad-3" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzI2NzNkNzA0LWQ2ZTQtNWVkNi05NjQzLWQ2MGY5ZTgwM2UwOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#trump-letter-ty-cobb" data-source-id="100000010118781"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian"><img alt="Karoun Demirjian" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-19T13:20:41.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 19, 2025, 9:20 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian" itemprop="name">Karoun Demirjian</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzI2NzNkNzA0LWQ2ZTQtNWVkNi05NjQzLWQ2MGY5ZTgwM2UwOA=="><a href="#trump-letter-ty-cobb">Prominent Republicans signed an open letter likening Trump’s actions to those of a ‘royal despot.’</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Earlier this month President Trump signed executive orders punishing two officials who served in his first administration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A number of prominent Republicans, including several former members of the first Trump administration, have signed <a href="https://statedemocracydefenders.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/open-letter-opposing-white-house-retaliatory-investigations-041825.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an open letter</a> decrying the president for using his power to punish two former administration officials who criticized him, likening his actions to those of a “royal despot.”</p><p>“For a president to personally and publicly direct the levers of the federal government against publicly named citizens for political reasons sets a new and perilous precedent in our republic,” the group wrote. “No matter one’s party or politics, every American should reject the notion that the awesome power of the presidency can be used to pursue individual vendettas.”</p><div><p>Earlier this month, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-law-firm-krebs.html" title="">issued two executive orders</a> revoking the security clearances of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chris Krebs</a>, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under during Mr. Trump’s first term and rebutted his claims that the 2020 election had been rigged and stolen, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-associated-with-an-egregious-leaker-and-disseminator-of-falsehoods/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miles Taylor,</a> who once served as chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security.

Some people at the White House believed it had been sent prematurely, according to the three people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about internal discussions. Others in the administration thought it had been meant to be circulated among the task force members rather than sent to Harvard.</p><p>But its timing was consequential. The letter arrived when Harvard officials believed they could still avert a confrontation with President Trump. Over the previous two weeks, Harvard and the task force had engaged in a dialogue. But the letter’s demands were so extreme that Harvard concluded that a deal would ultimately be impossible.</p><p>After Harvard publicly repudiated the demands, the Trump administration raised the pressure, freezing billions in federal funding to the school and warning that its tax-exempt status was in jeopardy.</p><p>A senior White House official said the administration stood by the letter, calling the university’s decision to publicly rebuff the administration overblown and blaming Harvard for not continuing discussions.</p><p>“It was malpractice on the side of Harvard’s lawyers not to pick up the phone and call the members of the antisemitism task force who they had been talking to for weeks,” said May Mailman, the White House senior policy strategist. “Instead, Harvard went on a victimhood campaign.”</p><p>Still, Ms. Mailman said, there is a potential pathway to resume discussions if the university, among other measures, follows through on what Mr. Trump wants and apologizes to its students for fostering a campus where there was antisemitism.</p><p>Mr. Keveney could not be reached for comment. In a statement, a spokesman for the antisemitism task force said, “The task force, and the entire Trump administration, is in lock step on ensuring that entities who receive taxpayer dollars are following all civil rights laws.”</p><p>Harvard pushed back on the White House’s claim that it should have checked with the administration lawyers after receiving the letter.</p><p>The letter “was signed by three federal officials, placed on official letterhead, was sent from the email inbox of a senior federal official and was sent on April 11 as promised,” Harvard said in a statement on Friday. “Recipients of such correspondence from the U.S. government — even when it contains sweeping demands that are astonishing in their overreach — do not question its authenticity or seriousness.”</p><p>The statement added: “It remains unclear to us exactly what, among the government’s recent words and deeds, were mistakes or what the government actually meant to do and say. But even if the letter was a mistake, the actions the government took this week have real-life consequences” on students and employees and “the standing of American higher education in the world.”</p><p>The letter shocked Harvard not only because of the nature of the demands but because it was sent when the university’s leadership and the lawyers it hired to deal with the administration thought they could head off a full-bore conflict with Mr. Trump.</p><p>For two weeks, Harvard’s lawyers, William Burck and Robert Hur, listened as Trump officials, in fairly broad strokes, laid out the administration’s concerns about how the school dealt with antisemitism and other issues.</p><p>On the administration’s side of this dialogue were three lawyers: Josh Gruenbaum, a top official at the General Services Administration; Thomas Wheeler, the acting general counsel for the Department of Education; and Mr. Keveney.</p><p>The back and forth lacked specifics on what the administration wanted Harvard to do. The Trump administration lawyers said they would send Harvard a letter last Friday that laid out more specifics.</p><p>By the end of the workday on Friday, the letter had not arrived. Instead, overnight, the lawyers from Harvard received a letter, sent from Mr. Keveney in an email, that was far different from the one the school had expected.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sean Keveney, acting general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services, is a member of the administration’s antisemitism task force.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ross D.

On Monday, Harvard said publicly that it could not accede to them.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Mr. Gruenbaum called one of Harvard’s lawyers, according to two people with knowledge of the calls. At first he said he and Mr. Wheeler had not authorized the sending of the letter. Mr. Gruenbaum then slightly changed his story, saying the letter was supposed to be sent at some point, just not on Friday when the dialogue between the two sides was still constructive, one of the people said.</p><p>A lawyer for Columbia University received a similar call from Mr. Gruenbaum around the same time, two people with knowledge of the call said. He, Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Keveney had also been engaged with Columbia about changes the task force wanted that university to adopt, and Mr. Gruenbaum wanted the Columbia lawyer to know that the letter to Harvard was “unauthorized,” the two people with knowledge of the call said.</p><p>Mr. Gruenbaum did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p><p>Later Monday, Harvard’s corporation and senior leaders were briefed on Mr. Gruenbaum’s assertion that the letter should not have been sent. The briefing left many on Harvard’s side convinced that the letter had been a mistake, three people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Harvard officials, including several who worked in government earlier in their careers, were shocked that such an important letter — bearing the logos of three government agencies, with signatures of three top officials at the bottom — could be sent by a mistake.</p><p>But at that point, there was no way for Harvard to undo what had already been set in motion. The university had already declared that it would rebuff the letter’s demands. And despite claiming that the letter should not have been sent, the Trump administration did not withdraw it.</p><p>In response to Harvard’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/why-harvard-resisted-trumps-demands.html" title="">decision to fight</a>, the White House announced that Mr. Trump was freezing $2.2 billion in grants to the school. Within a day, he was threatening to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status.</p><p>Maureen Farrell<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
