Tens of thousands of protesters have demanded his resignation, impeachment or arrest. His own party suggested that he resign early. The opposition has vowed to impeach him. The police are investigating possible insurrection charges against him.</p><p>Just last Saturday — the last time he addressed his country — Mr. Yoon had sounded contrite. In a televised speech, he had apologized for his martial law declaration and said that he would let his party decide how long he should stay in office. But on Thursday, he unexpectedly doubled down on his original stance, defending the decree as a bold move to “save the country” from what he called the “anti-state” opposition parties, which he accused of using a legislative majority to paralyze the nation.</p><p>“I will proudly confront it, whether it’s impeachment or investigation,” Mr. Yoon said. “I will fight to the end.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Yoon’s speech on Thursday at least made his intentions clear: He would not be pressured to resign, and he would fight in court if he were to be impeached. But his refusal to leave office risked further incensing Koreans who, according to opinion polls, overwhelmingly disapproved of his martial law declaration and support impeachment.</p><p>After Mr. Yoon’s speech on Thursday, dozens of people showed up at Mr. Yoon’s residence in central Seoul, blowing vuvuzelas, beating drums and yelling, “Arrest Yoon Suk Yeol!” The police held them back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions clashing with police officers blocking them from the president’s office in Seoul on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W. Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Yoon’s bold speech reflected his belief that he might have a fighting chance defending himself against impeachment in the country’s Constitutional Court, analysts said. His speech was also a battle cry aimed at his base of die-hard right-wing supporters, they said.</p><p>“No wonder why people call him a blind swordsman; he thinks he can overcome any challenge through his own bold initiative, no matter how crazy people may think it is,” said Ahn Byong-jin, a professor of political science at Kyung Hee University in Seoul. “He will launch a battle for public opinion ahead of a ruling at the Constitutional Court.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Yoon’s refusal to go quietly may further deepen the country’s political polarization, analysts said.</p><p>Already, huge crowds of protesters gathered near the National Assembly calling for his removal last Saturday, when the legislature met to vote on his impeachment bill. Smaller but equally loud rallies of mostly older South Koreans took place in downtown Seoul, vowing to protect Mr. Yoon. The bill was blocked when Mr. Yoon’s party boycotted it, but the opposition plans to try to impeach him again on Saturday.</p><p>In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Yoon said his decision to declare martial law and send hundreds of troops into the National Assembly was a legitimate exercise of his constitutional powers and did not amount to insurrection, as the opposition has charged.</p><p>“His speech reads like a summary of the defense argument he would use at the Constitutional Court,” said Kim Min-seok, a member of the main opposition Democratic Party’s leadership council. “He was using it to incite the extreme right wing into commotion.”</p><p>Mr. Yoon’s speech also further widened a rift within his governing People Power Party. In return for saving him from impeachment last Saturday, the party has urged him to resign by March. That would mean a new presidential election in April or May, which the party argued was the swiftest way to end the political turmoil triggered by the martial law decree.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Six of the 108 lawmakers in Mr. Yoon’s party have said they would vote for impeachment. The opposition needs just three more deserters from the party to pass the bill.</p><p>Han Dong-hoon, the chairman of Mr. Yoon’s party, who had earlier called for Mr. Yoon’s early resignation, said after the president’s speech that he now supported impeachment. “He was not repenting but justifying” his martial law, said Mr. Han, who is not a lawmaker. “Our people will never tolerate his speech, and it cannot be tolerated under democratic norms.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Han Dong-hoon, the leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power Party speaking at an emergency news conference in Seoul on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yonhap/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But Kwon Seong-dong, a Yoon ally who was elected as the party’s floor leader on Thursday, said its stance of opposing impeachment had not changed. The meeting at which Mr. Kwon was elected turned into a shouting match between Mr. Han and party members loyal to Mr. Yoon.</p><p>Mr. Yoon also faces the possibility of arrest, as prosecutors and the police investigate whether he had committed insurrection — a crime that carries the death penalty or life imprisonment for those who are deemed ringleaders. He has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-travel-ban.html" title="">barred from leaving the country</a> while the investigation continues. The Assembly on Thursday impeached the national police chief and the justice minister for their roles in Mr. Yoon’s martial law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Opposition lawmakers say Mr. Yoon sent troops to the National Assembly after declaring martial law in order to stop them from voting to reverse the decree, which the Constitution empowers the legislature to do.</p><p>He said he had deployed the thousands of police officers and hundreds of Special Forces troops only to maintain order, expecting that protesters would gather outside the legislature. He denounced the opposition’s accusation as “a false instigation.”</p><p>In his speech, Mr. Yoon cited a litany of complaints against opposition lawmakers as justification for his actions. He accused them of slashing his budgets for reinvigorating South Korea’s nuclear power industry and investigating drug traffickers, foreign spies and other criminals. He also criticized them for trying to impeach officials in his government and organizing frequent protest rallies, which he said were meant to push him out of office.</p><p>“They have become a monster that ruins the free democratic constitutional order of South Korea,” he said. “I had to do something.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Yoon’s address was broadcast live in South Korea on Thursday morning.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Wallace/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Yoon’s claim that he had not intended to stop lawmakers from voting against martial law contradicts testimony given by military officers in recent days.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Kwak Jong-geun, who commanded the Special Forces troops sent to the National Assembly, said that Mr. Yoon had called him personally during the operation, ordering him to have soldiers “break the door down right now, get in there and drag out the people inside” so that there would not be enough lawmakers to vote against martial law.</p><p>The troops broke into the main National Assembly building, where the lawmakers were gathering, but they were held off by parliamentary staff members and angry citizens. They retreated after the lawmakers unanimously voted against martial law, forcing Mr. Yoon to withdraw it. It lasted only six hours.</p><p>Although many governing party lawmakers criticized Mr. Yoon’s martial law declaration, they have been reluctant to impeach their own president, wary of the backlash such a move might draw among the party’s supporters. After dozens of governing party lawmakers joined the opposition to impeach President Park Geun-hye in 2016 on charges of corruption and abuse of power, they were branded as traitors in their conservative constituencies.</p><p>“It has been such a trauma for them,” said Sung Deuk Hahm, a professor of political science at Kyonggi University, west of Seoul. “But the crime President Yoon is accused of — insurrection — is of a different scale than Park Geun-hye’s crimes. The sooner they accept this, the sooner he will be impeached.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
