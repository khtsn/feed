Trump is seeking to delay his criminal sentencing in Manhattan until after the presidential election, imploring the judge overseeing the case to allow him additional time to challenge his conviction.</p><p>In a letter to the judge that was made public on Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, noted that his sentencing is currently set for Sept. 18, just weeks before Election Day. The lawyers argued that the timing could improperly influence voters and compromise Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his conviction on charges that he falsified records to cover up a sex scandal.</p><p>“Sentencing is currently scheduled to occur after the commencement of early voting in the presidential election,” the lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, wrote. “By adjourning the sentencing until after that election — which is of paramount importance to the entire nation,” they added, “the court would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of any future proceedings.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/16/nyregion/donald-trump-trial-delay-strategy.html" title="">who has routinely sought delays</a> in his four criminal cases, wants to use the extra time to fight his conviction, an effort that hinges on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling granting him broad immunity for official actions as president.</p></div></div><div><div><p>His lawyers cited that decision in their request that the judge, Justice Juan M. Merchan, overturn the verdict and throw out the charges. Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which brought the case, noted in response that it had nothing to do with Mr. Trump’s official acts in the White House.</p><p>Justice Merchan is weighing Mr. Trump’s immunity bid, and has said he will rule on Sept. 16, two days before the sentencing. Mr. Trump faces up to four years in prison, though the judge could impose a shorter sentence or only probation.</p><p>In the new letter to the judge, Mr. Trump’s lawyers argued that the two-day window between the immunity ruling and the sentencing was too short.</p><p>They argued that the sentencing should be postponed to “allow President Trump adequate time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options in response to any adverse ruling,” implying that they might seek to appeal the ruling, as expected, or even take action against Justice Merchan in federal court.</p><p>They also objected to the deadline for prosecutors to file a recommendation for Mr. Trump’s sentencing, which is set for 10 days before the judge hands down his punishment, and would come before Justice Merchan rules on the immunity issue.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The current timeline, they said, could be “personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the presidency.”</p><p>It is unclear how the district attorney’s office will respond to Mr. Trump’s request for a delayed sentencing. The office could reply to the letter in the coming days.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, declined to comment on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Trump made several attempts to delay his Manhattan trial, and has sought to do the same with the sentencing.</p><p>This spring, his lawyers requested that the trial be pushed back after the disclosure of a batch of evidence from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. They asked for 90 days; Justice Merchan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/nyregion/trump-bragg-trial-date-delay.html" title="">granted a three-week delay</a>, moving the start of the trial from late March to mid-April.</p><p>The former president was also originally scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, but his lawyers asked that the sentencing be delayed so the judge could consider whether the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity imperiled Mr. Trump’s conviction. When prosecutors did not oppose their request, Justice Merchan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/nyregion/trump-sentencing-hush-money-trial.html" title="">moved the sentencing to Sept. 18</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Trump’s latest request for a delay comes the same week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/nyregion/trump-trial-merchan-recusal.html" title="">Justice Merchan declined for a third time to step aside from the case</a>. It was Mr. Trump’s third attempt to remove the judge, whom the former president claims is biased against him.</p><p>During the trial, Justice Merchan made it clear that it was a priority for him to keep the proceeding on track, even as Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized him and his family.</p><p>After a seven-week trial, a jury of 12 New Yorkers convicted Mr. Trump on all 34 felony counts he faced, concluding that he had falsified records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the final days of the 2016 campaign.</p><p>The conviction centered on Mr. Trump’s cover-up of the hush-money deal. After his fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual liaison with Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump repaid Mr. Cohen and approved plans to lie on paperwork to hide the nature of the reimbursement, the jury found.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.
