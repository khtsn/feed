Many of the forecast models that meteorologists use show the storm strengthening rapidly over the next few days before hitting somewhere along the central to eastern Gulf of Mexico coastline Thursday.</p><p>This storm follows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/12/weather/hurricane-francine-louisiana" title="">Francine</a>, which spun across the western Gulf of Mexico this month. That storm struggled to organize and only slowly intensified into a weak Category 2 in the final few hours before making landfall in Louisiana and dropping a deluge of rainfall across New Orleans. If this storm system forms more quickly into a named storm across the Caribbean, it is more likely to become a hurricane or even a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico before it hits land.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Forecasters warned Monday afternoon that the system is expected to intensify into a major hurricane — meaning a Category 3 or higher, with wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour — before it approaches the northeastern Gulf Coast on Thursday, but that it was too soon to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of the potential storm’s impacts.

Ron DeSantis of Florida <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/09/23/memorandum-executive-order-number-24-208-emergency-management-potential-tropical-cyclone-nine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pre-emptively issued a state of emergency</a> on Monday, noting that parts of the state were still dealing with the effects of Hurricane Debby, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/06/weather/debby-storm-forecast" title="">brought significant rain last month</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="nine-map-path-embed" data-id="100000009714007" data-source-id="100000009714007"><div data-sourceid="100000009714007" id="embed-id-100000009714007">

As the storm passes between Cuba and Mexico it will unleash anywhere from four to eight inches of rain over western Cuba and the Cayman Islands with isolated totals around 12 inches and up to six inches over the Yucatán Peninsula.</p><p>Tropical storm warnings were issued for the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and Western Cuba, which means forecasters expect at the very least tropical storm-like conditions over the next couple of days. A hurricane watch, meaning there is a chance winds could increase to 74 miles per hour or higher, was in effect from Cabo Catoche to Tulum in Mexico and for Pinar del Rio of Cuba.</p><p>A tropical storm watch was issued Monday afternoon for parts of Florida, for the Dry Tortugas and the Lower Florida Keys south of the Seven Mile Bridge, indicating forecasters believe tropical storm winds could begin to worsen over that region within the next two days.</p><h2 id="link-199fbcfa">The likely scenarios as of Monday may change.</h2><p>On Monday afternoon the forecasts were becoming clearer among meteorologists, and the most likely scenario showed a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico making landfall along the Florida Panhandle sometime Thursday. Various models moderately agree that this could occur. It isn’t a set-in-stone forecast, and crucial data later in the day will give forecasters a better understanding of the storm’s likely next steps.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“While the spread in potential tracks has lessened compared to this point 24 hours ago, a range of landfall locations from the Florida Panhandle to the Peninsula of Florida are still on the table,” forecasters in Tallahassee, Fla., said Monday morning.</p><p>Computer models and the potential paths of a storm are based on where they assume the storm’s center will form. The models will continue to shift until this cluster of thunderstorms starts spinning around a common point.</p><p>A hurricane hunter plane flew through the storm Monday afternoon to understand better where that center might be forming. National Weather Service Offices around the Gulf of Mexico are sending extra weather balloon launches to feed data into the forecast models. This data will be pivotal in understanding what is likely to happen. By Tuesday, the models should be more reliable to a degree and the understanding of the storm’s path and possible intensity will probably be more obvious.</p><h2 id="link-749ee189">Some outlier possibilities could still happen.</h2><p>Despite much agreement in the computer models, the lack of current data means that forecasters and people along the Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the forecast and not discredit the outliers for now. At least one model suggests that landfall along the west coast of the Florida peninsula is possible. And early Monday morning model runs were all trending a little bit farther east. Another outlier suggests the storm may take a more western path into Alabama.</p><p>There is also a small chance that this storm never becomes a hurricane. If the storm encounters dry air like Francine did and is slow to form, it could mean a slower intensity. If the storm forms before reaching the Gulf, the ocean conditions would have enough energy to support rapid strengthening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Brian McNoldy, an expert in ocean temperatures and hurricane formation at the University of Miami, <a href="https://x.com/BMcNoldy/status/1837988460533072074" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says the Gulf of Mexico’s</a> the ocean’s heat content — the amount of thermal energy stored in the ocean — is extremely high. The hotter the ocean, the greater the influence it can have on storms like this one that is expected to form. The amount of energy that could fuel the storm is particularly high in the Gulf Loop current, a steady, strong current of warmer water that moves from the Caribbean and loops like a horseshoe in the eastern Gulf before moving through the Straits of Florida and connecting with the Gulf Stream.</p><p>It is common for storms traversing the loop current, like Hurricane Michael in October 2018, to get enough energy from the warm water to overcome conditions that might otherwise thwart development and rapidly intensify. This storm will most likely move right over the loop current and it isn’t out of the question for something similar to occur.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
