G.O.P. officials have in recent years mixed nativist calls with outreach to Spanish-speaking voters, with whom they have made gains.</p><p>Reports of the planned order on Friday were quickly cheered by those aligned with Mr. Trump’s anti-immigration policies.</p><p>“This is HUGE,” Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist, wrote on social media. “In an era of mass immigration, asserting that the English language as the American language, is a message of national UNITY.”</p><p>But the plan also prompted backlash from pro-immigration groups and Democratic leaders.</p><p>“Like dozens of the other executive orders and actions that have been taken, we’re going to have to examine if what he’s doing is actually in compliance with the law and the U.S. Constitution,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House minority leader, said on Friday. “And to the extent that it’s not, I’m confident that he will be sued.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>United We Dream, a youth-led group, noted that the United States had never designated an official language in its history.</p><p>“We mean this with all disrespect: No gracias,” said Anabel Mendoza,<strong> </strong>the group’s communications director. “We see exactly what Trump is trying to do by continuing to put a target on the backs of Black and brown immigrants and communities who speak different languages, and we won’t tolerate it.”</p><p>News of the planned order also brought resistance from the American territory of Puerto Rico, where 94 percent of residents speak Spanish.</p><p>“The president’s order declaring English as the only official language of the United States reflects a vision of American identity that conflicts with our Puerto Rican identity,” said Pablo José Hernández Rivera, the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico and a nonvoting member of the House. “There will be no statehood without assimilation, and Puerto Ricans will never surrender our identity.”</p><p>The president has long supported efforts to promote English-only practices in the United States. When he was first seeking the presidency in 2015, he mocked his rival Jeb Bush, who at times answered questions in Spanish.</p><p>“This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNjcAgNu1Ac" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump said</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers Congress with a focus on congressional investigations.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater">More about Luke Broadwater</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Trump and Zelensky: </strong>A meeting between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine turned into an angry shouting match at the Oval Office. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-transcript.html">Here are the key excerpts</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Student Loan Affordable Repayment Plans:</strong> The Education Department has pulled down all applications for borrowers seeking to enroll in income-driven repayment programs. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/student-loan-repayment-plans.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>National Weather Service: </strong>Cuts at the government agency responsible for issuing warnings, generating daily forecasts, advising local authorities and collecting the weather data that make these functions possible provoked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/weather/national-weather-serivce-cuts-trump-impact.html">swift condemnation from people in the field, some lawmakers and the public</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Security Administration</strong><strong>: </strong>The Social Security Administration, a crucial program that keeps millions of older Americans out of poverty, said that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/social-security-administration-job-cuts.html">reduce its head count by more than 12 percent</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Homeland Security and I.R.S.: </strong>The Department of Homeland Security has pushed the Internal Revenue Service to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/irs-immigrants-addresses.html">turn over the addresses of roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants</a> it is seeking to deport, according to three people familiar with the matter.
