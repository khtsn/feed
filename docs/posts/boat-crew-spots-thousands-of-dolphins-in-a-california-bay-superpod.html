It followed the small pod, knowing that dolphins are highly social marine animals that usually travel in larger groups.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some 30 minutes later, 15 dolphins had turned into hundreds. Then there were thousands.</p><p>“I kind of just take a glance and scan the horizon, and maybe about a mile and a half from us the water literally looked like it was boiling,” Mr. Brodsky, 35, said. “It was foaming. There were so many dolphins there.”</p><p>In previous outings, Mr. Brodsky had seen pods of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dolphins, but this was the first time that he had seen a gathering of so many northern right whale dolphins, mixed in with Pacific white-sided dolphins. In the past, he had seen only a few hundred of the species in one place.</p><p>Using his drone and past experience on the water, Mr. Brodsky estimated that there were more than 2,000 dolphins in the pod his team saw that Friday.</p><p>“The whole time we were just saying, ‘Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this is so amazing, I can’t believe this,’” he recalled. While the team is on the water almost every day, Mr. Brodsky said that the sight of the dolphins still gave him “butterflies.”</p><p>A sighting of thousands of northern right whale dolphins in a single pod is rare, though the species is known to be gregarious and willing to congregate with others, said Dorian Houser, the director of conservation biology at the National Marine Mammal Foundation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“The groups I have typically encountered are much smaller,” Dr. Houser said, adding that he has also spotted them in the Monterey Bay.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/multimedia/26xp-dolphins23/26xp-dolphins23-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/multimedia/26xp-dolphins23/26xp-dolphins23-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/multimedia/26xp-dolphins23/26xp-dolphins23-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Multiple dolphins leap off blue waters as they travel in a pod." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/multimedia/26xp-dolphins23/26xp-dolphins23-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/multimedia/26xp-dolphins23/26xp-dolphins23-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/multimedia/26xp-dolphins23/26xp-dolphins23-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/26/multimedia/26xp-dolphins23/26xp-dolphins23-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e4b23342-395a-5f87-ae94-23b783bd2893" decoding="async" width="600" height="344"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Northern right whale dolphins leaping off the waters of Monterey Bay in California.

There is a canyon that runs through the bay, which makes the area a “fairly unique” place that is full of nutrients and attractive to wildlife, Dr. Houser said.</p><p>Among the uncommonly large grouping of the northern right whale dolphins, Mr. Brodsky said he and his co-workers had seen mothers and their calves, which he had witnessed only a handful of times before.</p><p>The whale watchers made sure not to disturb what he called a “superpod” of dolphins by keeping a safe distance and navigating parallel to them. But at times, the dolphins would swim right next to their boat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Brodsky had seen other superpods before, including about a month ago when <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFQKC4ipV7V/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he captured</a> video of about 1,500 Risso’s dolphins in the Carmel Bay, which is south of Monterey Bay. Even so, “it’s like the first time every time” he sees the large groups swimming together.</p><p>“It’s the best feeling,” Mr. Brodsky said. “It’s indescribable.”</p><p>Christina Morales<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
