In a Jan. 2 essay, Drezner posed the question: “<a href="https://danieldrezner.substack.com/p/has-the-right-won-the-culture-war" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Has the Right Won the Culture War?”</a></p><p>“Over the last five years, the cultural ground has shifted dramatically to the right,” Drezner writes. While this does not mean that “the right is now culturally ascendant,” he added, “it does mean that neither progressive nor ‘nonpartisan’ elites possess the cultural cachet they did even a half-decade ago.”</p><p>What has changed, Drezner wrote, “is the erosion of the left’s cultural dominance.”</p><p>Drezner argued that “if it turns out the right controls both the ascendant political and cultural institutions in the United States, that presages a very different next decade than what many were expecting even a year ago.”</p><p>How did this shift occur?</p><p>First, an aggressive and opportunistic conservative movement recognized the crucial importance of new technologies in shaping politics and culture, in the dissemination of ideas and in providing credible, albeit partisan, analyses of the ills of society.</p><p>Most prominently, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/video/2024/12/how-did-elon-musk-become-the-most-powerful-man-in-washington" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a>, a Trump ally, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html" title="">bought Twitter</a> in 2022 and turned it into X, a major social media platform now tilted to the right.

Further down you can find firebrands like Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino cranking out new shows every day. Similarly, Joe Rogan, with his <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/03/joe-rogans-podcast-is-an-essential-platform-for-freethinkers-who-hate-the-left.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eternally inscrutable, R.F.K.

In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.”</p><p>The tech C.E.O.s are not alone in seeking Trump’s favor.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PARA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paramount Global</a>, which owns CBS, is reportedly exploring ways to settle a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over the way CBS handled an interview with Kamala Harris, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/abc-news-to-pay-15-million-to-settle-donald-trump-defamation-lawsuit-f1b8812d?mod=article_inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ABC News, which is owned by Disney, settled</a> a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump as the network contributed $15 million to Trump‘s future presidential foundation and museum, along with $1 million to cover legal fees.</p><p>Both cases reflect Trump’s determination to force the media to constrain hostile coverage. The strategy appears to be working.</p><p><a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/bios/view/anna-diakun" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anna Diakun</a>, a lawyer at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/21/trump-media-assault-silence-criticism" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Guardian</a>:</p><blockquote><p>These suits will have a significant chilling effect on news outlets. Even the threat of legal action may lead some to self-censor, rather than risk retribution. This is no accident — it appears to be Trump’s goal. The bottom line is that Trump’s lawsuits against media organizations — and his threats to file more — are a danger to press freedom.</p></blockquote><p>The Trump-Republican November sweep had an immediate effect on the partisan balance of power regarding cable news networks, which have long been crucial players in the dissemination of ideas, values and beliefs from the left as well as from the right.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Despite the closeness of the November election, the two more liberal cable channels, MSNBC and CNN, experienced a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/msnbc-cnn-fox-news-ratings-trump-83a883f5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severe decline in viewership</a> after Nov. 5, while Fox News <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-12-11/fox-news-dominates-2024-ratings-but-cable-news-still-faces-challenges" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ratings rose</a>.</p><p>I asked <a href="https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/communities-connections/faculty/dr-anya-schiffrin" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anya Schiffrin</a>, the director of the <a href="https://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/specializations/tmac/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technology, media and communications</a> program at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, about the differences between conservative and liberal communication systems. Schiffrin wrote back by email:</p><blockquote><p>It is remarkable how right-wing talking points now dominate discourse in many parts of the world. They’ve managed to galvanize voters by focusing on anxiety about crime, migration and inflation. Over the last couple of years, we’ve heard the story of migrant crime in Santiago, Stockholm, Melbourne, as well as New York.</p></blockquote><p>Over decades, Schiffrin continued,</p><blockquote><p>Republicans have done a superb job of messaging through the right-wing radio network as well as the tabloids and Fox television and now through social media. Many on the left have agonized about this and wondered whether they should create alternative media infrastructures</p><p>However, part of why the Republicans are so successful is the message rather than the medium. Republicans keep their message extremely simple and focus on topics that have salience. Explaining the nuances of crime statistics and telling people not to worry about crime is not persuasive when people go daily to CVS and see all the toothpaste and aspirin are under lock and key or feel threatened on the street or subway.</p></blockquote><p>An essential part of the conservative agenda, Schiffrin wrote, is what she calls “platform capture”:</p><blockquote><p>The tech titans want to avoid regulation and taxation, and many have a libertarian bent so it’s natural for them to collaborate with Donald Trump. The platforms and A.I. companies are counting on the United States to stop global regulation. Indeed, when Zuckerberg said recently that he would dismantle fact-checking efforts he also mentioned the need to beat back European regulation. A Trump and Zuckerberg-Musk alliance makes sense for all of them right now.</p></blockquote><p>While a major element of the conservative drive to set the cultural agenda is to control the medium — the websites, podcasts, messaging systems — another goal is to discredit and push back against liberal initiatives and claims.</p><p>On this score, <a href="https://manhattan.institute/person/christopher-f-rufo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christoper Rufo</a>, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of “<a href="https://manhattan.institute/book/americas-cultural-revolution-how-the-radical-left-conquered-everything" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">America’s Cultural Revolution</a>,” has almost single-handedly forced liberals to retreat on a host of issues.</p><p>Rufo can claim credit (or blame) for the corporate and academic retreat on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-race-theory" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critical race theory</a>; <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/dei-programs/story?id=97004455" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diversity, equity and inclusion</a> (better known as D.E.I.); and the <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/institute-for-sustainable-investing?cid=ppc-71700000088240726:700000002375624:58700007479666792:p67225357461&amp;gclid=753aaf45a4d01d3fc58dc8c811be6754&amp;gclsrc=3p.ds&amp;msclkid=753aaf45a4d01d3fc58dc8c811be6754" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental, social and governance</a> (E.S.G.) movement in corporate investing.</p><p>Two days ago, Rufo <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1881434291005251737" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boasted on X</a> of the rising status of the right in the nation’s culture:</p><blockquote><p>For the past four years, the Left has tried to condemn us as fringe, radical, extreme, and worse. But the truth is that we are mainstream, reasonable, popular, and ascendant. We’re no longer going to let Cluster B leftism ruin our institutions. If that’s your thing, try therapy.</p></blockquote><p>In a more subtle but no less significant development, two Wall Street Journal reporters, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/aaron-zitner" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aaron Zitner</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/meridith-mcgraw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Meridith McGraw</a>, described in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-maga-is-taking-back-the-culture-e76a7b1d?page=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article</a> on Jan. 19 how “in sports, entertainment and marketing, displays of conservatism are crowding out progressive postures.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Instead of taking a knee to call for social justice,” Zitner and McGraw wrote,</p><blockquote><p>N.F.L. players are doing the “Trump dance” in the end zone at football games.

That’s definitely new,” said Carson Carpenter, 19, a senior at Arizona State University. Conservatism, he said, ‘has really become intertwined in our pop culture. … It’s really showing that conservatism is cool now.”</p></blockquote><p>On a separate front, Zitner and McGraw wrote,</p><blockquote><p>Businesses are rolling back <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/corporate-dei-policy-changes-pull-back-33fdab87?mod=article_inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diversity efforts</a> that gained urgency after the murder of George Floyd by police in 2020 led to a focus on racial inequities.

Namely: a divide between “<a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/meet-the-symbolic-capitalists" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">symbolic capitalists</a>” and those who feel unrepresented in our social order.</p></blockquote><p>Two decades ago, al Gharbi wrote, the</p><blockquote><p>sociologists Jeff Manza and Clem Brooks <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/social-cleavages-and-political-change-9780198294924" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">observed</a>, “professionals have moved from being the most Republican class in the 1950s, to the second most Democratic class by the late 1980s and the most Democratic class in 1996.&#34; The consolidation they noted at the turn of the century is even more pronounced today. And as these professionals have been consolidated into the Democratic Party, they’ve <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231211068654" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grown increasingly progressive</a>, particularly on “cultural” issues (sexuality, race, gender, environmentalism), and especially relative to blue-collar workers.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.yaschamounk.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yascha Mounk</a>, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University and the author of “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/712961/the-identity-trap-by-yascha-mounk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Identity Trap: A Story of Ideas and Power in Our Time</a>,” has a different but related take. In an email, he wrote: “Each time Democrats lose, they blame the nature of modern communication.” He added:</p><blockquote><p>Since Trump was re-elected last November, they have lamented that left-of-center donors haven’t invested into creating progressives podcasts that could rival the influence of Joe Rogan (ignoring the fact that Rogan’s podcast never had such donors).</p><p>These arguments miss the forest for the trees. The reason Republicans have been more successful in spreading their message isn’t that they have bigger budgets or smarter staffers; it’s that they have been more adept at telling an aspirational story about the nature of the country — one that, as it turns out, a lot of citizens from all kinds of demographic backgrounds found to be convincing.</p><p>The truth is that Democrats are now in the midst of a deep epistemological crisis. They look at the country through simplistic categories, for example by assuming that it can be split into two rival blocks of ‘whites’ and ‘people of color.’ They talk about it in a linguistic register that most Americans find deeply alienating.

Now, among people who read the paper multiple times a week (roughly 15 percent of adults), Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than two to one.</p></blockquote><p>While both Democrats and Republicans have abandoned newspapers in growing numbers, Van Dam noted, the drop among Republicans accelerated much faster than it did for Democrats in 2016, the year Trump first ran for president.</p><p>Bottom line: Newspapers are a key source of information for Democrats but not Republicans.</p><p><a href="https://www.leighbureau.com/speakers/nsilver" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nate Silver</a>, the polling expert, took a more apocalyptic view of the problems facing liberals struggling to maintain cultural influence.</p><p>In a December Substack essay, “<a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-expert-class-is-failing-and-so" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Expert Class Is Failing, and So Is Biden’s Presidency</a>,” Silver argued that the emergence of the Democrats as “the party of the educated” has resulted in what he called “ <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/twitter-elon-and-the-indigo-blob" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Indigo Blob</a>,” which he described as</p><blockquote><p>the merger between formerly nonpartisan institutions like the media, academia and public health on the one hand — institutions that draw almost exclusively from the ranks of college graduates — and expressly partisan and political instruments of the Democratic Party and progressive advocacy groups on the other hand.</p></blockquote><p>This evolved liberalism, in Silver’s view, has undergone</p><blockquote><p>a double failure. Its institutions serve the public increasingly poorly — but it’s also increasingly losing politically. If Trump’s victory against a Harris campaign that <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/likability-isnt-enough" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">literally ran out of ideas</a> wasn’t proof enough of that, people are also voting with their feet, <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/sbsq-6-people-are-fleeing-california" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fleeing blue states and cities</a>.
