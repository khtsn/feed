He voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill backed by the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>“It’s clear that digital assets are here to stay,” Mr. Gallego <a href="https://www.gallego.senate.gov/press-releases/gallego-statement-on-genius-act/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> after the Senate Banking Committee hearing. Breaking from the committee’s top Democrat, he called the bill a “step in the right direction.”</p><p>The vote, 18 to 6, was only preliminary, advancing a bill that will require approval from the full Senate. But in the crypto world, it was celebrated as a moment of vindication.</p><p>Mr. Gallego is part of an increasingly influential cohort in Congress: beneficiaries of the crypto industry’s largess. During a tight Senate race last year, he was aided by $10 million from super PACs financed by three large crypto companies, including the Coinbase digital currency exchange. The money funded ads that promoted Mr. Gallego’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdOvCUmhJfc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military service</a> and support for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/15/crypto-election-ads-fairshake-00183700" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">border enforcement</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now he and dozens of other lawmakers supported by the super PACs are taking steps in Congress to advance crypto priorities, handing a series of long-awaited victories to an industry with an extensive history of fraud and volatility.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Ruben Gallego from the shoulders up, with the Capitol dome blurred in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl/00crypto-congress-gallego-wfhl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ab0d6f0f-a779-55a0-8f9f-95860c6054fb" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It’s clear that digital assets are here to stay,” Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said after a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the Senate, these legislators have thrown support behind the GENIUS Act, which would pave the way for businesses to issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/business/economy/federal-reserve-virtual-currency-stablecoin.html" title="">stablecoins</a>, a digital currency designed to maintain a price of $1. And in <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/03/12/house-passes-ways-means-legislation-to-rollback-biden-administrations-midnight-crypto-rule-in-bipartisan-vote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">both</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/biden-crypto-regulations-irs-vote" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chambers</a>, they have voted to repeal a Biden-era rule that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/senate-crypto-tax-repealed-defi-irs-b97c1f7b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required</a> crypto firms to report certain tax information to the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>An industry spending millions of dollars to influence Congress is hardly unusual. But crypto’s political machine has stood out for the scale of its spending — and the speed of the results.</p><p>The industry has responded with glee. The spending is already “bearing fruit,” said Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Fairshake, a super PAC that worked with two affiliated PACs to support pro-crypto congressional candidates. “This is a total sea change in terms of how Congress is approaching this industry.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The crypto legislation is progressing just as U.S. regulators roll back a yearslong enforcement campaign. Since President Trump’s inauguration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/technology/crypto-sec-trump.html" title="">dropped</a> lawsuits against major crypto firms like Coinbase and Kraken, lifting a legal cloud over the industry. An investor in crypto himself, Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month calling for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/trump-crypto-reserve-executive-order.html" title="">creation</a> of a national crypto reserve — a government stockpile containing Bitcoin and other digital currencies.</p><p>The stablecoin legislation is poised to benefit Mr. Trump’s business interests. At a crypto conference in March, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DYEnch-2is" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> stablecoins would “expand the dominance of the U.S. dollar” and called for “common-sense” legislation. A few days later, World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm that his family helped start, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/technology/trump-crypto-stablecoin.html" title="">announced</a> that it would begin selling a stablecoin called USD1.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Securities and Exchange Commission, right, has dropped lawsuits against major crypto firms in recent months.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The stablecoin bill could go to the Senate floor for a vote in the coming weeks — to the alarm of some Democrats who argue that Congress is giving the industry and Mr. Trump exactly what they want.</p><p>The crypto industry has “spent a lot of money, and many of our members are beneficiaries,” said Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. “Many of them may not have taken the time to really examine what it is we’re doing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Gallego was not a sponsor of the GENIUS Act, and has said it requires fine-tuning. (The full name is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act.) But he has also defended the bill, saying it includes protections for consumers.</p><p>“Senator Gallego believes it is important to have a seat at the table and work with colleagues on both sides,” Jacques Petit, his spokesman, said in a statement. “It remains the senator’s priority to ensure proper guardrails are in place.”</p><p>In an interview, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat who was a co-sponsor of the GENIUS Act, said crypto spending had no impact on the legislation.</p><p>“If you made your decisions on what you’re for based on who’s giving you the most money, you would fail as a member of Congress,” said Ms. Gillibrand, who was not funded by the crypto super PACs.</p><p>During the Biden administration, the industry hired expensive lobbyists to push for federal legislation, without making much headway. The 2024 campaign was a turning point.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A group of crypto executives and political strategists <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/14/silicon-valley-the-new-lobbying-monster" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">formed Fairshake and two affiliated super PACs</a>, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, which spent over $130 million to influence tight congressional races across the country. The spending was financed mostly by Coinbase, the digital currency business Ripple and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has financed more than 100 crypto start-ups.</p><p>Candidates backed by the super PACs won 53 of 58 races. In Ohio, Defend American Jobs spent $40 million to support Bernie Moreno, a Republican crypto entrepreneur who unseated Senator Sherrod Brown, the Democratic chair of the Banking Committee and an outspoken crypto critic. Protect Progress spent $10 million to help Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, win a Senate seat in Michigan. And another $10 million from the super PACs boosted Mr. Gallego, who had spoken <a href="https://www.standwithcrypto.org/politicians/person/ruben---gallego" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">favorably</a> about crypto in the past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Digital Chamber, a trade association, at a lobbying day with members of Congress in January.

Executives at firms like Coinbase, Ripple and Binance, a giant exchange that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/binance-changpeng-zhao-pleads-guilty.html" title="">settled criminal charges</a> with the U.S. government in 2023, have descended on Washington, meeting with lawmakers and posing for photographs on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>Their first priority is the bill laying out rules for stablecoins. The second is “market structure” legislation that would ensure most cryptocurrencies are not subject to enforcement lawsuits by the S.E.C., which conducted a crackdown during the Biden years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Many lawmakers backed by the crypto super PACs are positioned to advance those objectives. Mr. Moreno, Mr. Gallego and Senator Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican who was supported by the PACs, serve on the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Gallego is also the highest-ranking Democrat on a new Senate subcommittee <a href="https://www.gallego.senate.gov/in_the_news/senate-banking-committee-convenes-its-first-digital-assets-subcommittee/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">devoted</a> to crypto.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the Senate race in Ohio last year, Defend American Jobs spent $40 million to support Bernie Moreno, a Republican crypto entrepreneur.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>A draft of the crypto market structure bill is still in the works. But a group of senators, including Senator Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the Banking Committee, introduced the GENIUS Act in February.</p><p>In some ways, companies that issue stablecoins are similar to banks. The coins are supposed to be backed by assets that the issuer holds in reserve: If a firm sells one million stablecoins, it should have $1 million in a vault somewhere so customers can redeem the coins at any time.</p><p>But over the years, crypto companies have been scrutinized for failing to maintain sufficient reserves. At the same time, stablecoins have become a useful tool for criminals looking to move money across borders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In theory, the GENIUS Act addresses those problems by outlining rules for stablecoin issuers. But in February, a coalition of consumer groups <a href="https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Coalition-Letter-Opposing-GENIUS-STABLE-Acts.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> the bill “a crypto industry wish list, not an adequate regulatory regime.” They argued that the bill’s requirements were too loose and would create major risks for customers.</p><p>Even some crypto enthusiasts have expressed reservations. A provision in the GENIUS Act would allow overseas companies to get around some of its requirements.</p><p>When the bill advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee, four Democrats other than Mr. Gallego, none of whom received support from Fairshake, also voted for it, along with Mr. Moreno, Mr. Banks and 11 Republicans who weren’t backed by the crypto PACs.</p><p>A similar bill, the STABLE Act, was <a href="https://steil.house.gov/media/press-releases/steil-and-hill-introduce-stable-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced</a> in the House last month, prompting Democrats to raise concerns that the new rules could benefit Mr. Trump’s crypto business.</p><p>“The president of the United States of America should not be using the power of the office to create business that will enrich himself,” Ms. Waters said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But after a marathon hearing on April 3, the House Financial Services Committee voted <a href="https://steil.house.gov/media/press-releases/bipartisan-steil-hill-legislation-the-stable-act-clears-committee#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20STABLE%20Act%20passed,a%20vote%20of%2032%2D17." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">32 to 17</a> to move the bill to the full chamber.</p><p>The chair of that committee is Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas — a longtime crypto supporter, a co-sponsor of the stablecoin bill and the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2024?cmte=Fairshake+PAC&amp;tab=targeted_candidates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beneficiary</a> of $100,000 in spending by Fairshake.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-23"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="crypto-callout" data-id="100000010101769" data-source-id="100000010101769"><div slug="crypto-callout" data-sourceid="100000010101769" id="embed-id-100000010101769">
