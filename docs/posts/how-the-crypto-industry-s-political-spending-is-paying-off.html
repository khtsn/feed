href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/03/10/2025/executive-session" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hearing</a> last month, Senator Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, sided with a group of Republicans in a hotly contested debate. He voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill backed by the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>“It’s clear that digital assets are here to stay,” Mr. Gallego <a href="https://www.gallego.senate.gov/press-releases/gallego-statement-on-genius-act/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> after the Senate Banking Committee hearing. Breaking from the committee’s top Democrat, he called the bill a “step in the right direction.”</p><p>The vote, 18 to 6, was only preliminary, advancing a bill that will require approval from the full Senate. But in the crypto world, it was celebrated as a moment of vindication.</p><p>Mr. Gallego is part of an increasingly influential cohort in Congress: beneficiaries of the crypto industry’s largess. During a tight Senate race last year, he was aided by $10 million from super PACs financed by three large crypto companies, including the Coinbase digital currency exchange.

Since President Trump’s inauguration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/technology/crypto-sec-trump.html" title="">dropped</a> lawsuits against major crypto firms like Coinbase and Kraken, lifting a legal cloud over the industry.

The 2024 campaign was a turning point.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A group of crypto executives and political strategists <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/14/silicon-valley-the-new-lobbying-monster" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">formed Fairshake and two affiliated super PACs</a>, Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, which spent over $130 million to influence tight congressional races across the country. The spending was financed mostly by Coinbase, the digital currency business Ripple and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has financed more than 100 crypto start-ups.</p><p>Candidates backed by the super PACs won 53 of 58 races. In Ohio, Defend American Jobs spent $40 million to support Bernie Moreno, a Republican crypto entrepreneur who unseated Senator Sherrod Brown, the Democratic chair of the Banking Committee and an outspoken crypto critic. Protect Progress spent $10 million to help Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, win a Senate seat in Michigan. And another $10 million from the super PACs boosted Mr. Gallego, who had spoken <a href="https://www.standwithcrypto.org/politicians/person/ruben---gallego" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">favorably</a> about crypto in the past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the Digital Chamber, a trade association, at a lobbying day with members of Congress in January.

The coins are supposed to be backed by assets that the issuer holds in reserve: If a firm sells one million stablecoins, it should have $1 million in a vault somewhere so customers can redeem the coins at any time.</p><p>But over the years, crypto companies have been scrutinized for failing to maintain sufficient reserves. At the same time, stablecoins have become a useful tool for criminals looking to move money across borders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In theory, the GENIUS Act addresses those problems by outlining rules for stablecoin issuers.

A provision in the GENIUS Act would allow overseas companies to get around some of its requirements.</p><p>When the bill advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee, four Democrats other than Mr. Gallego, none of whom received support from Fairshake, also voted for it, along with Mr. Moreno, Mr. Banks and 11 Republicans who weren’t backed by the crypto PACs.</p><p>A similar bill, the STABLE Act, was <a href="https://steil.house.gov/media/press-releases/steil-and-hill-introduce-stable-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduced</a> in the House last month, prompting Democrats to raise concerns that the new rules could benefit Mr. Trump’s crypto business.</p><p>“The president of the United States of America should not be using the power of the office to create business that will enrich himself,” Ms. Waters said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But after a marathon hearing on April 3, the House Financial Services Committee voted <a href="https://steil.house.gov/media/press-releases/bipartisan-steil-hill-legislation-the-stable-act-clears-committee#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20STABLE%20Act%20passed,a%20vote%20of%2032%2D17." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">32 to 17</a> to move the bill to the full chamber.</p><p>The chair of that committee is Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas — a longtime crypto supporter, a co-sponsor of the stablecoin bill and the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2024?cmte=Fairshake+PAC&amp;tab=targeted_candidates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beneficiary</a> of $100,000 in spending by Fairshake.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-23"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="crypto-callout" data-id="100000010101769" data-source-id="100000010101769"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">We are looking into how the Trump administration and Congress are dealing with the crypto industry, and are interested in all tips.
