Cannon, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, dismissed the charges in their entirety. Her ruling determined — against decades of legal precedent — that Mr. Smith had been unlawfully appointed to his post as special counsel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While Mr. Smith’s deputies challenged that decision, they were ultimately forced to drop the appeal where Mr. Trump was concerned after he was re-elected in November. A binding Justice Department policy prohibits pursuing criminal prosecutions of a sitting president.</p><p>But prosecutors did not immediately seek to drop their appeal regarding Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira. The case remained in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit after Mr. Trump took office and the top leadership of the Justice Department was replaced by his appointees.</p><p>In their filing on Wednesday, prosecutors gave no explanation for why they had decided now to dismiss the appeal against Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira. But it was widely expected that Mr. Trump or the Justice Department would take some sort of action to have the case against the men dropped. Mr. Nauta, in particular, remains close to Mr. Trump and still serves as one of his top personal aides in the White House.</p><p>The only aspect of the classified documents case that remains unresolved at this point concerns a section of a final report that Mr. Smith wrote about the proceeding. A separate section of Mr. Smith’s report concerning the other federal case he filed against Mr. Trump — the one accusing him of plotting to overturn the 2020 election — was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/trump-jan-6-report-aileen-cannon-jack-smith.html" title="">released this month</a>.</p><p>During the Biden administration, top Justice Department officials had sought to release the classified documents section of the report to Congress alone, saying it should not be made public while the case against Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira was still active.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But last week, Judge Cannon intervened and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/trump-jan-6-report-aileen-cannon-jack-smith.html" title="">barred officials from sending that volume of the report to anyone outside the Justice Department</a> out of concern that lawmakers might make public comments about it.</p><p>It seems unlikely that the department will now release the classified documents volume, given that both Judge Cannon and Mr. Trump’s lawyers have said it contains revelations that could be damaging not only to the president but also to some “anticipated” members of his administration.</p><p>But news organizations, including The New York Times, have filed Freedom of Information lawsuits seeking to obtain a copy of the report.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
