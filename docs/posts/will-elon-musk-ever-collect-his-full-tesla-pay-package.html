But a Delaware judge just dealt the Tesla C.E.O. a blow, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-ruling.html" title="">refusing to reinstate</a> his huge pay package despite investors approving the compensation by a wide margin in June.</p><p>Tesla said it would <a href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1863730393930735634" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeal the verdict</a>. But it’s unclear if or how Musk will escalate the fight, especially given that he now has powerful allies in Washington as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.</p><p><strong>A recap:</strong> In 2018, Tesla set out several performance milestones that Musk needed to hit to qualify for a huge grant of stock options. He did, becoming eligible for compensation that is now valued at $100 billion.</p><p>But Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package.html" title="">voided the plan</a>, agreeing with a shareholder who argued that Tesla’s board was too beholden to the company’s chief when it devised the package.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Winning the June vote didn’t guarantee a payout for Musk.</strong> Yes, the compensation plan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/business/dealbook/elon-musk-pay-package-win.html" title="">was backed</a> by holders of 72 percent of Tesla shares not owned by himself or his brother, Kimbal Musk. The wide support suggested that the automaker’s shareholders believed that the company’s fortunes were tied to keeping its C.E.O. happy. (Tesla’s shares were down about 1 percent in extended hours trading.)</p><p>But in Monday’s ruling, McCormick said that the new shareholder vote didn’t resolve the issues she had with the plan.</p><p><strong>How would an appeal play out?</strong> Tesla and Musk signaled they would ask the Delaware Supreme Court to review the case. Meanwhile, Tesla’s board could draft a new pay deal under the jurisdiction of Texas, where the company has its headquarters, though Tesla would take a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/what-is-next-musk-after-judge-rules-against-him-tesla-pay-case-2024-12-03/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">big accounting hit</a>.</p><p>Ann Lipton, a business law professor at Tulane University Law School, told DealBook in an email that the reasoning in McCormick’s ruling on Monday was strong and unlikely to be reversed, but that her original decision would be under the microscope.</p><p><strong>Could Musk flex his new political muscle to punish Delaware?</strong> Since McCormick’s ruling in January, the Tesla chief has moved the automaker’s corporate home to Texas and campaigned to have other companies reincorporate elsewhere. “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1863728056474419580" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Absolute corruption</a>,” he wrote on X of Monday’s decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Musk may now have the ear of Trump and congressional Republicans, but Lipton said that any efforts by Washington to punish Delaware would probably require new legislation.</p><p>Musk’s threats were potentially counterproductive, Lipton added: The state’s Supreme Court “can’t rule in his favor without looking cowed,” she said.</p><p><strong>Worth noting:</strong></p><ul><li><p>McCormick denied a request for $5.6 billion in legal fees from the lawyers for the shareholder who contested the pay plan, but <em>did</em> award them <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/musk-record-tesla-pay-package-rejected-again-by-delaware-judge?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$345 million in cash or Tesla stock</a>.</p></li><li><p>Musk isn’t exactly hurting financially.

That said, even asset sales may not be enough by themselves to fix what’s ailing the company.</p><p><strong>The backstory: </strong>Over the weekend, Intel’s board told Gelsinger — who became C.E.O. in 2021 after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/intel-ceo-swan-gelsinger.html" title="">his predecessor was ousted</a> amid investor dissatisfaction — that his efforts to catch up to chip-making rivals including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung weren’t moving fast enough. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retires-amid-chipmaker-s-turnaround-plan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reports</a> that Gelsinger was given the option to retire or be forced out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The board also worried about Intel’s stock price, which has fallen over 50 percent this year, and uncertainty over whether the company was making sufficient progress in both semiconductor manufacturing and designing advanced chips like those produced by Nvidia.</p><p><strong>Some Intel watchers see deal making as a path forward.</strong> Gelsinger was open to some M.&amp;A., including selling a stake in the Altera division that makes reprogrammable chips. But some analysts and former board members urged bigger transactions, like spinning out the chip-manufacturing foundry division that has been a key business focus (and that helped Intel win billions in government grants via the CHIPS and Science Act).</p><p>Others have raised the prospect of Intel selling assets like its core chip design business to competitors such as Qualcomm and Broadcom, which had signaled interest before, or its 88 percent stake in Mobileye, which makes chips for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>It could help that Frank Yeary, Intel’s interim executive chair, is a longtime deal maker.</p><p><strong>But M.&amp;A. could be tricky.</strong> Doing a deal with Qualcomm or Broadcom — which reportedly aren’t as keen on a transaction — would require approval by antitrust regulators in the United States and elsewhere. That’s not a given, though Intel could argue that such a move would strengthen an American tech giant against international competition.</p><p>And the Biden administration’s deal to invest billions in Intel includes restrictions that could affect the chipmaker’s ability to sell stakes in the foundry unit if the company doesn’t own at least 50.1 percent of the business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Intel may just have to trudge along for a while.</strong> Analysts at Bernstein wrote to investors that ​​ “the situation here seems likely to keep getting worse before it gets better, and the ultimate fate of the company seems even more uncertain.”</p><hr/><h2 id="link-6566fa17">“I feel like an M.M.A. fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out, yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute.” </h2><p><em>— </em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/02/feds-waller-leaning-toward-a-rate-cut-but-worries-about-inflation-.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Christopher Waller</em></a><em>, a Fed governor, using a mixed martial arts metaphor on Monday to flag his concerns that progress to bring down inflation has stalled.
