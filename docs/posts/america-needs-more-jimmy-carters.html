Yet he is also considered <a href="https://millercenter.org/president/carter/life-after-the-presidency" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of Americaâs greatest ex-presidents</a>, for using the residual star power of his office to help his successors and his country as a peacemaker, backstage diplomat, human rights champion, monitor of free elections and advocate for the homeless while finding time to write poetry and, by his own example, providing the best possible case for traditional religious values.</p><p>In 2002, having been nominated many times for the Nobel Peace Prize, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/international/nobel-peace-prize-awarded-to-carter-with-criticism-of-bush.html" title="">Mr. Carter finally won</a> it for his âvital contributionâ to the Camp David agreement, which set the stage for peace between Israel and Egypt, as well as for his commitment to human rights, his work fighting tropical diseases and for furthering democracy everywhere.</p><p>His life offers countless lessons for leaders everywhere.</p><p>Mr. Carter came to the presidency owing little to anyone, including his own party. Assembling a formidable coalition of small-town and rural voters, white blue-collar voters and African Americans, he surprised everyone in America â except perhaps himself and his wife, Rosalynn â when he beat Gerald Ford in <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/nov-2-1976-carter-defeats-ford-in-presidential-election/" title="">the 1976 election</a>.</p><p>In retrospect, he could not have run at a more auspicious moment. The previous decade had been brutal for the United States. One president, Lyndon Johnson, chose not to seek another term because of rising public anger at an unwinnable war in Vietnam. Another, Richard Nixon, resigned to avoid impeachment. Assassinations claimed the lives of yet another Kennedy, Bobby, and the nationâs premier civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. The war ended in humiliating failure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Then along came this born-again farmer-businessman from Georgia with a record of service in the Navy. He was a disciplined man of integrity and rock-solid values whose vision was to restore honor to government and, thus, change the mood of the capital and the country.</p><p>âTrust me,â Mr. Carter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/20/archives/the-night-carter-took-over.html" title="">said</a> again and again on the campaign trail. âI will never lie to you.â His opponent, the incumbent president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/gerald-rudolph-ford-jr" title="">Gerald Ford,</a> was an honorable man, but had few defenses. The burden of the multiple duplicities and corruption of Mr. Fordâs predecessors was simply too heavy.</p><p>On the whole, Americans liked Mr. Carter. They liked that he took the oath of office on a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/politicians-turn-historic-bibles-oath-office/story?id=31840112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bible</a> used by George Washington, that he jumped out of his limousine during the inaugural cavalcade and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/21/archives/crowd-delighted-as-carters-shun-limousine-and-walk-to-new-home.html" title="">walked the rest of the way</a> to the White House. They even liked the <a href="https://twitter.com/CarterLibrary/status/1202936473676386307" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dutiful cardigans</a> he wore during his television appearances. Although some of this was political theater, there was no doubting his decency and idealism and, as a manager, his drive and determination.</p><p>These traits helped him achieve some big and good things. On foreign policy, Mr. Carter courageously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/14/archives/to-unsteal-the-panama-canal.html" title="">faced down the demagogues on the Panama Canal</a>, giving Panama long-overdue sovereignty over its own territory. He energetically pursued new controls on strategic arms. He risked much to achieve what was by any measure his most important victory, the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/052779israel-treaty.html" title="">Camp David accords</a>, in which Egypt and Israel agreed to make peace. The agreement would not have been possible without Mr. Carterâs tireless, day-to-day stewardship of the negotiations.</p><p>There were triumphs as well on the home front. Among the most important of these was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/29/us/president-abolishes-last-price-controls-on-us-produced-oil.html" title="">deregulation of oil and natural gas prices</a>, aimed at increasing supply, lowering energy costs and reducing Americaâs increasingly risky dependence on foreign oil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There is just as much to admire in Mr. Carterâs powerful conservation ethic, which led eventually to a legacy of wilderness protection that few presidents can match, most prominently <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/house-bill/39" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act</a>, signed just before leaving office, protecting more than 100 million acres of Alaskan land in one stroke.</p><p>Signing that act was one of the few bright spots in Mr. Carterâs last year in office, when everything seemed to fall apart, when it became clear that moral suasion and good intentions and hard work were of little use in the face of powerful forces that were largely beyond his control. Try as he might, he could not get a grip on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/13/archives/gas-shortage-spurs-carter-decline-in-poll-oil-companies-under.html" title="">rising prices and gas shortages</a>, nor could he brighten the national mood in ways that he had hoped. In this he was often his own worst enemy; his efforts to get the country to face the facts as he saw them often left his audiences dispirited. He seemed downbeat, having lost some of his original joy, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/opinion/kai-bird-jimmy-carter-life.html" title="">his disdain for the political impact of his actions</a> caught up to him.</p><p>Exhibit A was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/16/archives/a-sixpoint-program-president-says-democracy-faces-a-severe-threat.html" title="">his famous malaise speech on July 15, 1979</a>, which he prepared while isolating himself at Camp David. The speech was aimed at addressing the energy crisis, unemployment and inflation, as well as a vaguer but no less ominous danger. He did not use the word âmalaiseâ to describe it. What he said was this: âThe threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.â</p><p>This was plain speaking from the man from Plains, Ga., and many applauded it as such. But the good will was short-lived: People saw it as the work of a scold, a rebuke, a condemnation of the way they lived their lives, not a call to action. Within days, Mr. Carter fired several members of his cabinet. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/books/review/president-carter-stuart-eizenstat.html" title="">Stuart Eizenstat</a>, a key adviser and the author of the definitive (and largely redemptive) account of Mr. Carterâs presidency, Vice President Walter Mondale was so demoralized by the speech and the firings that he thought, briefly, of quitting.</p><p>Then came the crusher: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/21/world/significant-dates-in-the-hostage-crisis.html" title="">the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran</a> by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeiniâs young zealots, followed by 444 days in which 52 Americans were held hostage. There was not much Mr. Carter could do about it; indeed, as Mr. Eizenstat reminds us, he foresaw that something awful might happen if, as people had urged him to do, he admitted the dying shah of Iran to this country for cancer treatment. Which, being Jimmy Carter, he had to do. The crisis consumed Mr. Carterâs final year; a rescue attempt was a fiasco. The whole sorry business further undermined his status as a leader.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Just as the nation was ripe for a good man in 1976, so it was ripe in 1980 for an upbeat, relentlessly happy, cheerfully disorganized, politically shrewd Hollywood pitchman named Ronald Reagan, a guy who talked not of sacrifice but of endless possibilities, of America as a shining city on a hill. Mr. Carter, still in his 50s, went back to Georgia and embarked on one of the busiest and most fruitful retirements ever.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/opinion/jimmy-carter-s-contribution.html" title="">As this board observed in 1994</a>, compared with Mr. Carter, most former presidents struggled to use their stature for the common weal. Most wrote memoirs. Some disappeared into private life; some set up foundations; some went around collecting large sums for speaking. Mr. Carter took risks and played crucial roles as an honest broker in nuclear talks with North Korea and in civil conflicts on the continent of Africa and in the Middle East.</p><p>He described his second career as âwaging peace.â That work remains far from finished, and it remains for those who admired Mr. Carter to continue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
