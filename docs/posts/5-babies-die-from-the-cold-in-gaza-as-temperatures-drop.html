The child was stiff, blue, dark blue in color from the cold.”</p><p>Ali, who like his brother was born premature, was in critical condition and on a ventilator in the hospital’s intensive care unit because of the effects of hypothermia, according to Dr. Wisam Shaltout, head of the hospital’s neonatal unit. “Conditions inside tents in this cold weather make it next to impossible for babies like Ali and his brother to survive,” he said in a phone interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dr. Shaltout said an earlier report from the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency, Wafa, that Ali had died was inaccurate. But he added that even if Ali recovered, there could be long-lasting damage to his brain or other organs.</p><p>“What breaks my heart is that if Ali survives this, we will give him back to his parents who will take him back to the cold tent that almost killed him and that killed his twin brother,” Dr. Shaltout said.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
