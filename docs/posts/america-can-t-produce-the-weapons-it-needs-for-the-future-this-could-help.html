It will harmonize the ground rules for companies in all three nations, removing many obstacles to sharing while holding onto controls for the most sensitive technologies and, in some cases, toughening punishment for violations.</p><p>Australian and American officials called it an important step toward modernizing an outdated approach to technology at a time when China has been making rapid advances and the United States struggles to produce the weapons demanded by a contentious world.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Benalla munitions factory in Australia. The country is already producing artillery shells to help replenish depleted U.S. stockpiles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matthew Abbott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Australian officials said that the new legal framework will allow license-free trade for more than 70 percent of the exports from the United States to Australia that currently fall under what is known as ITAR, for International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and 80 percent of the trade subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations, which cover less sensitive products.</p><p>While some details are still in flux, equipment removed from the licensing requirements would likely include traditional munitions, like the artillery shells Australia is already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/world/australia/us-weapons-production.html" title="">producing</a> to help replenish stockpiles that have been depleted by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Some technologies that have both military and civilian uses, such as sensors and propulsion systems, will also get exemptions across all three partner countries.</p><p>The most strategically important technologies would still require licensing — including nuclear propulsion and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/world/australia/quantum-technology-aukus.html" title="">quantum navigation systems</a>, which use quantum physics rather than satellites to determine location. Officials in Australia have said they hope these can be exempted if and when they move from research to the production phase.</p><h3 id="link-305978a7"><span><strong>The Risks</strong></span></h3><p>More sharing could mean more opportunities for espionage or leaks to adversaries.</p><p>To get Thursday’s arrangement approved by Washington, Australia and Britain passed <a href="https://www.aigroup.com.au/news/member-advices/2024/nat-01124-sams-act-dtc-act-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laws</a> and approved new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-to-exporters-202409-update-on-aukus/nte-202409-update-on-aukus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rules</a> to create a standard of protection roughly in line with the United States. Australia has gone even further: Violations are now subject to “absolute liability,” which means accidental sharing — an errant email — could lead to prison.</p><p>Critics in the defense industry argue that approach highlights another risk: overregulation. Some have expressed concern that fears of punishment will undermine recruiting and create a chilling effect on collaboration.</p></div></div><div><div><p>There are also complaints that Thursday’s agreement did not alter the U.S. laws that effectively prohibit many immigrants from sensitive work because they treat the transfer of export-controlled technology to a foreign worker in the U.S. as an export to that person’s country. Now all three AUKUS nations have similar rules.</p><p>Some experts said even more technologies need to be exempt from export restrictions. For instance, ITAR licensing is still required for weapons like autonomous underwater drones that could be needed in large numbers if there was ever a conflict with China over Taiwan, the self-governed island that China considers its own.</p><p>“The goal in changing these regulations is to produce greater collaboration, innovation and investment into defense capabilities,” said Charles Edel, Australia chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Ultimately, the effectiveness of these changes will depend less on what the three governments say and more on how the private sector reacts to these changes.”</p><h3 id="link-6cf47283"><span><strong>The Potential Benefits</strong></span></h3><p>Supporters believe that streamlining the framework for defense production across all three allies could be a catalyst for revolutionary collaboration.</p><p>They imagine a scenario where competition and collaboration delivers greater innovation and production capacity at a time when China may already be ahead of the U.S. with technologies like hypersonic missiles and quantum computing.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The American production system “is to some extent broken,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, with long delays and high costs centered around Defense Department procurement requests and layers of regulations.</p><p>He said he hopes that deals like AUKUS will allow companies to develop and bring new ideas to defense officials in all three countries, and eventually, maybe to an even larger group.</p><p>Japan and other U.S. allies have also expressed an interest in being part of the same new, more open approach that AUKUS has set out to develop.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Damien Cave is an international correspondent for The Times, covering the Indo-Pacific region.
