Employees depart without any planning for who will take over their roles.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-doge.html?smid=url-share" title="">Elon Musk’s time</a> with the federal government is up, but his chain saw approach to firing workers, freezing spending and canceling contracts continues to reverberate in the empty halls of agencies in Washington and around the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Current and former federal workers describe a government that in some cases remains paralyzed with uncertainty, waiting for direction from senior officials. Everyday tasks now take much longer, with added layers of supervisory approvals that they say make their work harder. Thousands of government employees are now being paid not to work, all in service of Mr. Musk’s efficiency mandate, which President Trump billed as a way to purge the government of diversity initiatives and as a cost-cutting initiative to better serve the American public. (There is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-trump.html" title="">scant evidence of any savings</a>.)</p><p>And while Mr. Musk is going back to running his companies, the federal work force reductions he set in motion have yet to fully take effect. Tens of thousands of government workers have been braced for layoffs for more than a month.</p><p>Moreover, some of the aides that Mr. Musk installed in agencies remain in place, seeking to continue their version of the efficiency and modernization drive.</p><p>The current and former federal workers who described morale and working conditions in the wake of Mr. Musk’s initiatives did so on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Even people who have left government asked to remain anonymous out of concern that speaking out could jeopardize their severance agreements.</p><p>“Musk leaving is a little bit like the departure of Godzilla after there’s an attack on the city,” said Max Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that works to promote best practices in the federal government. “There’s a lot of stuff that’s been flattened, and the damage is profound, but it’s not actually over.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A White House spokesman disputed that assessment, saying that Mr. Musk’s team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, had “delivered remarkable results at an unprecedented pace.”</p><p>“DOGE is integral to the federal government’s operations, and its mission, as established by the president’s executive order, will continue under the direction of agency and department heads,” said the spokesman, Harrison Fields.</p><p>In his social media post on Wednesday noting that his time in Washington was coming to a close, Mr. Musk said that the efficiency initiative he began “will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Mr. Musk’s DOGE team attempting to enter the U.S. Institutes of Peace in March.

Then he has to see if that person is willing to pay for basic utilities. In other words, he said, two or three people are now needed to carry out a task that one person used to do.</p><p>The Forest Service employee who paid for lawn care out of his own pocket said multiple new versions of contract forms have emerged this year, going from version five to version 11. It was so difficult to get approval for a snow plowing contract for property in New England that a contractor was plowing on good faith until the payment was approved two months later, the employee said.</p><p>And the silence about what is coming next is deafening, the employee with the General Services Administration said. In addition to learning about departures from email error messages, the lack of information from supervisors is unprecedented, especially as workers await word on the timing of planned layoffs. People are scared and nervous, the employee said, adding that colleagues who are typically calm under pressure are freaking out.</p><p>Mr. Musk did not consider the impact of programs he directed agencies to cut and showed little interest in understanding the bureaucracy he so loathed, said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“He has managed to inflict maximum pain with no discernible gain,” Ms. Murray said in a statement. “I fear we are going to be living with the devastating consequences of his actions for years to come, especially since President Trump is plowing ahead with Elon’s cuts.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Calls to the General Services Administration may go unanswered because so many people have left, and there has been no planning for who will take over their roles, an official there said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA, via AP Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>At the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, there have been so many changes that employees struggle on a daily basis to keep track, one wildlife conservationist said.</p><p>So many senior officials have taken the voluntary retirement options that there is a significant “brain drain” across the agency, she said. People are getting shuffled in and out of jobs with very little notice. Morale is at an all-time low, particularly with the string of insults from Mr. Musk and others about government workers being lazy. Those who still have jobs are in survival mode status, she said.</p><p>The rash of personnel changes and legal challenges have left thousands of federal workers in a state of job limbo as well, as they wait for court developments to inform them of their employment status.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The goal for many is to stay out of the line of fire, an archaeologist with the Department of Agriculture said. If they or their work does get hit, she said, the goal is to direct the bullet to the leg instead of the heart, so that there is still something left once the destruction ends.</p><p>So far there is no end in sight, and Mr. Musk’s loyalists are still embedded in government agencies.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brytonshang/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bryton Shang</a>, a former tech executive now serving as a senior adviser at the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, was spotted in one of the agency’s elevators, an employee there said. Mr. Musk was never actually around the office, she said. But his staff is very much still there.</p><p>Donald F. Kettl, professor emeritus and the former dean of the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy, said Mr. Musk’s departure from government casts a long shadow.</p><p>“DOGE was never so much an entity, but an unguided missile that crushed programs and people in its way, and a recruitment machine” that embedded DOGE staff throughout the government, he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eileen Sullivan is a Times reporter covering the changes to the federal work force under the Trump administration.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Trump Pardons: </strong>A blitz of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/trump-pardons-hoover-grimm-chrisley.html">pardons and commutations have included those who have expressed political support</a> for the president, such as Larry Hoover, a drug kingpin who was convicted of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/trump-larry-hoover-chicago-gang-leader.html">leading a vast street gang from inside an Illinois prison.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Trump and Putin</strong>: The American president’s preference for praising and excusing the Russian leader has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/trump-putin.html">yielded no progress toward peace in Ukraine,</a> a war he once bragged he would end in just 24 hours.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elon&#39;s Exit From Washington:</strong> The billionaire, distanced from Trump, has made clear he is frustrated with the obstacles he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-doge.html">encountered as he tried to upend the federal bureaucracy.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>16 States Sue Trump:</strong> A group of attorneys general, led by Letitia James of New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/nyregion/trump-science-funding-lawsuit.html">responded to $1.4 billion worth of cuts</a> arguing that National Science Foundation programs are critical for leading in science and technology.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kennedy and Avian Flu: </strong>Ostriches on a British Columbia farm have died of the avian flu.
