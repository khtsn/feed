<p><strong>We saw an interview during the game with Rob Moore, the CEO of Sentinels. With him being in Korea, what are your guys&#39; relationship with him, and how important is it to have a CEO so proud of where you are? What kind of impact has he made being here in Korea with you guys?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>zekken: &#34;I&#39;m terrified of the guy personally. He came here and said if we lost we&#39;d have to swim home, so I guess it&#39;s extra motivation.&#34;</p>
  
  <p>Kaplan: It&#39;s a lot of fun to have an owner that&#39;s so passionate and invested in Valorant esports. Even when we&#39;re just hanging out on the LA grind, he&#39;ll come in and discuss other games or strategies, which is a lot of fun.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How does it feel to get through the group stage and what does this mean for you and the team?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TenZ: &#34;It definitely feels amazing. We wouldn&#39;t have won if we didn&#39;t play our best as a team individually. I&#39;m really proud of everyone. It&#39;s definitely been an awesome journey this entire year. I feel like we&#39;re coming back up with our confidence. It feels really nice.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You made changes to the composition on Icebox. You made a return to the old familiar composition for the team and brought back Sacy on Sova in place of Gekko. What was the game plan behind these changes and how successful were they?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kaplan: &#34;We did not have a lot of time to piece an Icebox composition together. I think we were all on the same page that we have an incredible, world-class, proven Sova player who&#39;s been very comfortable on the agent for a very long time. We felt it was a bit of an easier comp to pilot to rather than Gekko with very little prep time.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How does it feel to shut up the haters and get your form back after a bad end to VCT Americas?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zellsis: &#34;Everyone voted for us to be overrated. Look at us now. We&#39;ve taken your gods down.&#34;</p>
