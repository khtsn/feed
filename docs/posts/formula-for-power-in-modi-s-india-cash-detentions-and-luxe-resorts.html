But first came an invitation to have dinner in the suburbs with a senior official from their party in the Indian state of Maharashtra. They would share a car ride, and Mr. Deshmukh could catch the train from there.</p><p>It was all a ruse.</p><p>As the car approached its destination, it kept speeding along, and eventually joined a caravan of other vehicles. That, Mr. Deshmukh said, is when he realized he was being kidnapped. The car was heading across state lines, where he would be held in a hotel behind locked gates and later restrained and drugged after trying to flee.</p><p>Mr. Deshmukh had become a pawn in what is known as “resort politics,” a longstanding practice unique to India’s rough-and-tumble democracy.</p><p>The senior party official in the car with Mr. Deshmukh that night in June 2022 had secretly recruited a group of governing-party lawmakers to try to bring down the state government in Maharashtra. To ensure that they would stick to the plan, the lawmakers were moved to other states and isolated in luxury resorts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Deshmukh and at least two other Maharashtra lawmakers, according to their own accounts, were taken against their will. The leaders of the insurrection wanted to make certain that their breakaway faction had a sufficient number of lawmakers to deprive the government of a majority and force it to collapse.</p><p>The hidden hand behind the maneuvering, according to several lawmakers with knowledge of the events, was the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a series of closely contested states, his Bharatiya Janata Party, after failing to win power through elections, has gained effective control through similar episodes in which lawmakers were sent to resort hotels until their government fell.</p><p>In Maharashtra, several lawmakers said, some of the defectors had been paid to switch loyalties. Other lawmakers who sided with the B.J.P. had publicly spoken beforehand of coming under withering pressure from investigating agencies controlled by Mr. Modi’s party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Deshmukh, center, in his constituency in Akola, in western Maharashtra.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The takeover of state governments is an extreme example of the no-holds-barred quest for total power by the B.J.P. under Mr. Modi. As the country’s most dominant leader in a generation, he is working to entrench a new vision of India, one where the B.J.P. and its Hindu-nationalist ideology reign supreme for decades to come. Deep footholds at the state level are crucial to his mission.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Maharashtra, the prize for the B.J.P. was as big as any in India: a state of 130 million people that is the country’s financial and entertainment powerhouse.</p><p>The machinations caused two of Maharashtra’s important parties to each split in two, pitting family members against one another, and scrambled the state’s political landscape, leaving an opening for a B.J.P.-led coalition to take control. Residents have a favored term for this confusing new state of affairs: kichdi, a mush of a dish in which the rice can’t be told apart from the lentils.</p><p>On Saturday, early results of the state’s first election since the breakaway insurrection appeared to reinforce the B.J.P.’s anything-goes approach. A coalition led by the party was on track to win a strong majority to form the new government. Analysts said that two years in charge of government agencies and the state’s rich coffers, in which it expanded welfare programs and infrastructure projects, had put the coalition in such a dominant position in the election that it blew away its opposition.</p><p>“Don’t ask about ideology in Maharashtra — the entire politics of the state has changed,” Ajit Pawar, one of the politicians the B.J.P. brought to its side by pressing him to split from his family, <a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/2024/11/11/ajit-pawar-on-a-secret-adani-amit-shah-meeting-hindutva-u-turn-and-his-lok-sabha-mistake" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acknowledged to an interviewer</a> before the state election. “Everyone wants power here. Ideology has been sidelined for power.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ajit Pawar, center, a Maharashtra politician who aligned himself with the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Once power became everything, Mr. Deshmukh found himself trapped.</p><h2 id="link-41b65b">By Any Means</h2><p>Resort politics is such a feared practice that mere rumors can send rival parties running to protect themselves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the southern state of Karnataka, home to the cash-rich tech hub of Bengaluru, Mr. Modi’s party brought down the government in 2019 by getting a dozen governing-party lawmakers to flee to a hotel in Mumbai, then controlled by the B.J.P. The defectors remained there until their party leader resigned and the government fell.</p><p>In Madhya Pradesh, in central India, the B.J.P. coaxed an opposing senior political leader into resigning from the government in 2020. He brought with him about 20 lawmakers, many of whom decamped to a resort in Bengaluru, a city run by the B.J.P. Madhya Pradesh is now a B.J.P. fortress.</p><p>The practice of resort politics <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/the-history-of-resort-politics-in-india-1120326.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">goes back decades</a>, to the time when the Congress party, run by the Nehru-Gandhi family, started losing its long dominance of Indian politics and an era of coalition politics began. Often, it was used not to bring down a government, but to keep one intact.</p><p>More recently, on at least two occasions, whispers that the B.J.P. was on a poaching hunt led other parties to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/world/asia/india-congress-sachin-pilot.html" title="">lock up their own lawmakers</a> in resorts for days, until the threat had dissipated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The B.J.P. uses its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/world/asia/india-election-donations.html" title="">deep pockets</a> to win allies and keep them on board. Equally important is the party’s control over feared national investigating agencies, determining who remains in politics, who profits from its vast riches and who winds up sidelined in a jail cell.</p><p>In states like Jharkhand and the capital region, Delhi, where the B.J.P.’s attempts to break smaller parties have not worked, elected leaders have ended up in jail, paralyzing local governance.</p><p>Suhas Palshikar, a veteran political scientist based in Pune, said the B.J.P.’s orchestrated fragmentation of politics in Maharashtra fit a pattern in its push for hegemonic control.</p><p>“They want to establish state-level governments by whatever means,” he said, “because they know that their overall social and political dominance can sustain only if they have control over the state governments.”</p><h2 id="link-399fe3f">Desperate to Escape</h2><p>The car ride that delivered Mr. Deshmukh into a weeklong ordeal landed him first at a resort in Gujarat, Mr. Modi’s home state, where the prime minister has close to absolute power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Orange Megastructure hotel in Gujarat, where lawmakers from neighboring Maharashtra decamped as they worked to bring down their state government.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Two dozen rebel members of his party, the Shiv Sena, gathered at a hotel named the Orange Megastructure, a favorite of the B.J.P. official who ran Gujarat.</p><p>Thirty-five rooms were booked (some lawmakers had come with their assistants, and at least one with her husband). More than 200 police officers were called in to lock down the hotel. Racks of clothes were wheeled in.</p><p>The defecting lawmakers had set off from Mumbai with Mr. Deshmukh and at least two other lawmakers they hoped to bring to their side.</p><p>Both of the others tried to escape before they reached the hotel in the diamond-trading city of Surat. One bolted from a car during a traffic jam. After walking for miles, he persuaded a truck driver headed to Mumbai to give him a ride.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I was sweating, it was raining, I was getting wet,” said the lawmaker, Kailas Patil.</p><p>Mr. Deshmukh, 50 — a colorful first-time lawmaker who during an interview with The New York Times took off his shirt and asked a reporter to feel his flexing pecs (“Like a rock,” an aide said) — became a headache to the mutineers only after the group had reached the hotel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Deshmukh, 50, a first-time lawmaker, said he became a headache to the mutineers only after the group had reached the hotel.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Inside the resort, the breakaway lawmakers issued demands to the Shiv Sena leaders back in Mumbai: They would not return until Uddhav Thackeray, leader of both the party and the state, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-uddhav-thackeray-eknath-shinde-shiv-sena-crisis-7985485/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dissolved his coalition</a> and stepped aside for a new governing coalition with the B.J.P.</p><p>Mr. Deshmukh was in touch with Mr. Thackeray, according to his own account, and wanted to leave right away. But the hotel gates were locked, and outside was a wall of police officers. Eknath Shinde, the Shiv Sena leader who had lured Mr. Deshmukh to Surat, showed his temper when Mr. Deshmukh said he would break the window and jump out.</p><p>“Shinde got mad and shouted at someone, ‘Bring me the pistol; I will finish myself here,’” Mr. Deshmukh recalled. “I said, ‘Sir, even if you kill me and kill yourself, I am still not staying.’” Mr. Shinde did not answer requests for an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The two men had been brought to this point by months of maneuvering by the B.J.P., propelled by cash and coercion.</p><p>The B.J.P. was once an ally of Mr. Thackeray’s father, a cigar-in-hand political cartoonist who had founded the Shiv Sena with an army of Hindu vigilantes.</p><p>Mr. Shinde, a onetime auto-rickshaw driver who dresses in immaculate whites, was being groomed as an alternative to Mr. Thackeray, who had been painted as soft and inaccessible by the B.J.P. as he tried to move the Shiv Sena toward the mainstream.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of Maharashtra’s chief minister, Eknath Shinde, at an election rally in Mumbai this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atul Loke for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>When the B.J.P. began courting Shiv Sena lawmakers, according to several with knowledge of the discussions, some were paid <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/they-offered-me-rs-50-crore-to-switch-sena-mla-udaysingh-rajput/articleshow/92480776.cms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of dollars</a> to switch their allegiance. “In cash,” said Arvind Sawant, a Shiv Sena lawmaker in Maharashtra. The figures could not be independently verified.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Many had another powerful incentive to align with the B.J.P.: They were under investigation by the B.J.P.-controlled central government. Before the rebellion, Shiv Sena lawmakers had publicly <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-reading-between-the-lines-of-sena-mla-pratap-sarnaiks-letter-7369115/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged Mr. Thackeray</a> to “patch up” with the B.J.P. so “the harassment” would stop.</p><p>B.J.P. leaders, as well as the security officials involved in the Surat episode, declined to discuss details of the case, including allegations of cash payments. C.R. Patil, the B.J.P.’s chief in Gujarat, played down his own role in the episode but acknowledged the party’s contribution. “It wasn’t my doing — it was the party’s,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Shinde’s associates denied that Mr. Deshmukh and other lawmakers had been kidnapped. “They weren’t children that we could have thrown in a car and taken by force,” said Bharat Gogawale, a lawmaker and Shinde lieutenant during the coup.</p><h2 id="link-51ed229c">Political Fractures</h2><p>On the night of the uprising, when Mr. Deshmukh was finally allowed to leave the hotel in the predawn hours, dozens of police officers broke away from a security cordon and followed him in the rain-slicked dark.</p><p>But as he waited for a ride promised by leaders of his party trying to save their government, he said, the police tossed him into a vehicle and took him to a government hospital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The hospital where Mr. Deshmukh said he was injected with sedatives as he tried to escape Gujarat.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“I kept telling the doctors, ‘I am not sick; I am a lawmaker,’” Mr. Deshmukh recalled.</p><p>Around 5:30, before the sun came up, Mr. Deshmukh was pinned to the hospital bed, he said, and injected with sedatives.</p><p>“Some tears came out of my eyes,” Mr. Deshmukh said. “Then I passed out.”</p><p>The next day in the local newspapers, the police in Gujarat — a dry state — were quoted as saying that the lawmaker had been found so drunk and unruly that he had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.</p><p>Eventually, he asked Mr. Shinde to let him travel home and calm his wife, who had lodged a missing-person complaint with the police, as well as supporters who were angered by his treatment. If Mr. Shinde let him go, Mr. Deshmukh said, he would rejoin the rebels afterward. But as the plane chartered for him landed, and Mr. Deshmukh saw hundreds of his supporters, he told Mr. Shinde’s men they could either take a hike or get beaten up, according to his own account.</p><p>A week into the uprising, after the mutinous faction had hopped from one resort to another across three B.J.P.-run states, Mr. Thackeray finally resigned. He was replaced by Mr. Shinde.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“I don’t want to play these games,” Mr. Thackeray said in a televised statement. The insurgents danced on the tables at a Goa resort.</p><p>Not long after, the B.J.P. went after another Maharashtra party, the secular Nationalist Congress Party, getting its No. 2, Ajit Pawar, to split from his aging uncle, who had built the party over decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sharad Pawar, center, 83, founder of the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra with his lawmaker daughter, Supriya Sule.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>An early verdict on the Maharashtra chaos came this spring, in national parliamentary elections. The B.J.P. lost more than half of its seats in the state. Mr. Pawar, the party’s new ally, fared even worse in the face of a wave of sympathy for his 83-year-old uncle.</p><p>But for Mr. Shinde, the chief benefactor of the 2022 rebellion, the results in the general election were promising. His faction won enough seats to keep him as the face of the governing coalition for the state election this week, where he improved in his showing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Numbers from the campaigning period show how much money and muscle govern Maharashtra’s politics.
