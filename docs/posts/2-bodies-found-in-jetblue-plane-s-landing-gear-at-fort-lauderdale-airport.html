The bodies were discovered during a routine post-flight maintenance assessment of the plane, the airline said.</p><p>Paramedics pronounced the two people dead at the scene, according to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. It was unclear how long the people had been in the landing gear compartment.</p><p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages Kennedy Airport, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how the individuals may have gained access to the aircraft.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, Carey Codd, a public information officer with the sheriff’s office, said the two individuals were both men but said their identities were not yet known. He said the Broward County Medical Examiner’s Office would conduct autopsies to determine the cause of their deaths.</p><p>Landing gear compartments, located under an aircraft’s wings and at the front of the plane, have long been used by people attempting to travel undetected on airplanes. The airline did not say whether the two people who were found dead on Monday were stowaways.</p><p>Such attempts to hide in landing gear compartments have proven deadly in the past. The compartments open and close upon takeoff and landing to deploy and retract wheels and other landing components, and other stowaways <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/world/europe/stowaway-london-garden-heathrow.html" title="">have fallen to their deaths</a> from the openings, sometimes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/stowaway-death-jose-matada-british-airways-heathrow" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">landing in public spaces</a> along flight paths.</p><p>Those who can stay within the compartment risk being crushed by landing gear when it is withdrawn back into the aircraft, along with other hazards, including severe temperatures, pressure changes and lack of oxygen. Many stowaways die of hypothermia.</p><p>As recently as Christmas Day, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/us/body-found-united-airlines-wheel-well-maui-hawaii.html" title="">a body was discovered</a> in a wheel well of a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Hawaii.
