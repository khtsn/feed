They weren’t going to see Gaelic football or hurling. Instead, the 30-something dads were there for a sold-out watch party hosted by the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>Soon they would be inside, eating wings, dogs and tater tots and washing it all down with pints of Guinness as they watched a telecast of the Steelers playing the Colts in Indianapolis.</p><p>The N.F.L. has played only one game in Ireland — a preseason contest in 1997. So, for now, the next-best N.F.L. experience De Lappe and Murphy can get is attending a gathering with more than 800 other avid fans twirling Terrible Towels. Their dream is a trip to the United States to see the Steelers play in the Super Bowl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Steelers lost to the Colts in Indianapolis, but the fans in Dublin enjoyed food and Guinness.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shane De Lappe, a Steelers fan in Ireland, said his dream is to see the team in the Super Bowl in person.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I would sell a kidney for it,” De Lappe said. “The two of us are Steelers fans, so hopefully we’ll get over there in the next few years.”</p><p>Short of that, they would certainly take a regular-season game in Ireland. If the enthusiasm of the fans at the watch party is any guide, the Steelers and the N.F.L. could expect to sell out Croke Park’s 82,300 seats if a game in Dublin were announced. Many of them watch games on the NFL Network’s RedZone streaming service, play fantasy football and travel to London and the United States to see games. Boys are hooked on the Madden NFL video game and watch clips of games on YouTube.</p><p>“He got the gear, then the RedZone and that’s it,” said Chris Bull as his 11-year old son, Ruari, wearing a Ja’Marr Chase Bengals jersey, stood nearby. “He took an American football to school for show-and-tell.&#34;</p><p>Bull, Paul Keane and Ben Deans, all neighbors in Dublin, brought their sons to the watch party and have held sleepover parties to watch the Super Bowl with their friends.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Despite the demand for all things N.F.L. in Ireland, however, the league is playing a longer game. It is moving at a deliberate pace to ensure that sponsors, media partners and other key pieces — like a critical mass of committed fans — are in place before teams and dates are chosen for a game.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans at the watch party got a chance to mingle with Steely McBeam, the team’s mascot.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It’s about putting roots down,” Henry Hodgson, center, who oversees the N.F.L.’s operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, said of events like the watch party.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The goal is not to be the traveling circus and turn up and then go away again,” Henry Hodgson, who oversees the N.F.L.’s operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, said at the watch party, which featured the former Steelers players Willie Parker and James Farrior, and the team’s mascot, Steely McBeam. “It’s about putting roots down.”</p><p>The N.F.L. is well established at home, so it has been expanding overseas for decades in search of new fans and revenue. Teams have been playing regular-season games in London since 2007 — the final London game this season is between the Jacksonville Jaguars and the New England Patriots on Sunday — and the league has increased the number of games and locations in recent years to include Mexico, Germany and Brazil. Next year, a game will be played in Madrid for the first time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The league can increase the number of international games next year to as many as nine, up from five this year. Last month, Commissioner Roger Goodell said the N.F.L. could ultimately play up to 16 games a year overseas, though it might require adding an 18th regular-season game.</p><p>But unlike prior international efforts dating back to the 1980s, when teams played preseason games around the globe and the league ran a spring league in Europe, the N.F.L. is now relying more on teams to lay the foundations in different countries.</p><p>The Los Angeles Rams, for instance, have focused on Australia, Japan and other Pacific Rim countries, while the Miami Dolphins have forged ties in Brazil, Spain and other countries with ties to South Florida. The Kansas City Chiefs made inroads in Germany because the soccer team FC Dallas, which is owned by the Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, has an alliance with Bayern Munich. The Chiefs generate more than a million euros ($1.1 million) in revenue in the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the past two years, the Steelers executive Dan Rooney III and his team have made a half-dozen trips to Ireland and Northern Ireland.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“It’s about growing the game of football and growing the Steelers brand,” Rooney said of the team’s outreach.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The Steelers have focused on Mexico, where the team became popular during their heyday in the 1970s, and Ireland, for personal reasons: The Rooney family, which has owned the team since Art Rooney founded it in 1933, emigrated from the island in the 1840s. In 1976, Dan Rooney, Art Rooney’s son, co-founded The Ireland Funds, a philanthropic group that fosters stronger ties between Ireland and the United States and reconciliation with Northern Ireland. He was U.S. ambassador to Ireland from 2009 to 2012, and hosted flag football games at his residence on July 4 instead of baseball games. (He also found a statue of a raven there and had it buried on the grounds, not wanting any reminder of the Baltimore Ravens, the Steelers’ rivals.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In the last two years, his grandson, Dan Rooney III, and his operations team have made a half-dozen trips to host watch parties and flag football clinics in Ireland, and Newry, the Rooney’s ancestral home in Northern Ireland. He has also forged relationships with business leaders, sponsors and media partners in the country.</p><p>“It’s about growing the game of football and growing the Steelers brand,” Rooney, the team’s director of business development and strategy, said in Dublin in September.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Steelers have held flag football and kicking clinics in Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Rooney family’s ancestral home.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Willie Parker, a former Steelers running back, has been part of the team’s efforts in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>American football is barely played in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but according to league estimates, 350,000 fans on the island<span>  </span>follow or watch N.F.L. games out of a combined population of about seven million. The N.F.L. has grown in popularity thanks to easy access to streaming packages, fantasy football and game clips on YouTube. N.F.L. games are shown on Sunday evenings when few other sports are being played, though given the time difference, viewership drops for the late games. Interest jumped this year after Charlie Smyth, a Gaelic football player from Northern Ireland, was signed as a kicker on the New Orleans Saints’ practice squad.</p><p>“The internet makes the world smaller,” said Michael McQuaid, who co-hosts the Irish Steelers Podcast<span>  </span>and started a Steelers fan group. “There’s been a real shift now that there are many more fans here. The discussion now is how to create a Super Bowl-style event.”</p><p>The Steelers, who last played overseas in 2013, are eager to play in Ireland. Last month, Goodell quipped that a day doesn’t go by that he doesn’t hear from the Rooneys about the possibility of a game in Dublin.</p><p>“I have no doubt we will be playing in Ireland,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c39lyxwdpw3o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Goodell said last week</a>. “I don’t know if it’ll be next year but it’s coming soon.”</p><p>Peter McKenna, who runs Croke Park, the home of Gaelic sports, said he was sure that tickets would sell out quickly if a game was announced in Dublin. Many of the ticket buyers would probably be Steelers fans from the United States, using the chance to see their N.F.L. team as an excuse to visit Ireland. College teams have played in Dublin for decades and drawn sizable crowds, including in August, when 27,000 fans flew across the Atlantic to see Florida State play Georgia Tech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Florida State and Georgia Tech played in front of a big crowd in Dublin in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Moran/Sportsfile, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peter McKenna, who runs Croke Park, said he was sure that a Steelers game in Dublin would sell out quickly.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But McKenna, Irish business leaders and the Steelers acknowledge that many steps large and small remain. The airport must make space for charter jets. The teams will need buses, hotels and training facilities, as well as additional security. The stadium locker rooms would need to be expanded.</p><p>“The N.F.L. player is a massive man,” McKenna said, adding that league officials toured the stadium this summer.</p><p>The government is also trying to determine the economic benefits of an N.F.L. game and whether they outweigh the costs. Local authorities would have to provide technological services and power for broadcasters, among many other services.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“We’re still in the exploratory stage,” said Paul Kelly, chief executive of Failte Ireland, the national tourism authority running that analysis. “To bring any major event, you are looking at the fees and support services, and it’s a multimillion-euro investment. But they bring significant benefit in return through taxes.”</p><p>In addition to the travel and gameday logistics, the league wants to ensure that playing in Ireland accelerates business. The Steelers have been producing localized content on social media and bringing alumni to visit Ireland. The team has two media deals in Ireland, including one that broadcasts their preseason games. A game could draw even more lucrative deals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>N.F.L. games are shown on Sunday evenings in Ireland, when few other sporting events are taking place.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Jacksonville Jaguars and the Jets have joined the Steelers in increasing marketing efforts in Ireland.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“I don’t think you need to be laser-focused on a linear return on your investment,” said Paul McCann, chief executive of a Dublin-based technology services company, Ergo, that is exploring a potential sponsorship with the Steelers. “The buyers of our services are C-suite and I.T. people who are usually sports crazy, so it’s a good connection” to be linked to the Steelers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The Jacksonville Jaguars and the Jets are also making entrees into Ireland on top of their marketing efforts in Britain. Like the Steelers, the Jaguars have taken former players to Ireland and hosted football clinics, and in April, they had an Irish fan announce one of the team’s draft picks.</p><p>“It’s definitely a growth market, and it’s famous for its love of football,” said Sarah Brookes, who represents the Jaguars in London. “Soccer is incredibly popular because it’s a global sport, but there is a huge proportion of fans who follow N.F.L. football instead of soccer.”</p><p>The Steelers, though, with their deep ties to Ireland, appear to have the inside track to be the first team to play a regular season game here.</p><p>“They’ve taken a long-term sustainable approach,” said Mick O’Keefe, chief executive of Irish operations for Teneo, a firm helping the Steelers with their strategic planning and communications in Ireland. “They didn’t come in wham bam and say, hey, we’re here and do a smash-and-grab.
