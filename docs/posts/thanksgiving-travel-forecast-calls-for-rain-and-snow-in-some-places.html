Out West, another storm may take aim at California on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>A mild storm developing across the Midwest on Monday will spread toward the East Coast on Tuesday. Forecasters expect it to bring mostly nuisance rain that may slow down some travelers.</p><p>Tropical rainfall will surge into California again through Tuesday, less than a week after a strong atmospheric river hit some places in Northern California with over a foot of rainfall. This week’s event should be weaker, affecting areas farther south in Central and Southern California, rather than in places that are still saturated from last week. Any rain that falls in Los Angeles should be lighter, while the heavier rain of a few inches is likely to fall over areas farther north, like Santa Barbara.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It’s important to check the weather forecast along your entire route and to stay off the roads if rain or snow makes travel too dangerous, Aixa Diaz, a spokeswoman for AAA, advised.</p><p>“Try to have a Plan B,” Ms. Diaz said, adding that if it’s possible, try to leave a day earlier or later to avoid being on the road during the worst of the storms. “Ultimately your loved ones and your family and friends, they want you to get there safely.”</p><p>Last Thanksgiving, Ms. Diaz said over half a million people were rescued by AAA, and the inclement weather this week could make it “rough.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Out West, the moisture from another atmospheric river,<span>  </span>a powerful type of storm that affects the West Coast, will surge inland, producing feet of snow over the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and into the central Rocky Mountains.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While rain comes down over the East and West Coasts, Michael Whitaker, the Federal Aviation Administration administrator, said during a news conference last week that airports were expected to be the busiest on Tuesday before Thanksgiving. He said that the F.A.A. was closely watching the weather, which is the greatest source of flight delays.</p><p>If your flight is significantly changed, delayed or canceled, the Department of Transportation’s new rule, which went into effect last month, now entitles you to a refund from your airline.</p><p>Brenda Orelus, who has been a flight attendant for 10 years, said one of the best ways to avoid travel disruptions is to check the weather forecasts for your flight&#39;s departure point, layovers and destinations well ahead of any delay announcements. If inclement weather is on the way, she recommends rebooking for an early morning flight or another day entirely to avoid being stuck.</p><p>“You can just option out of all the anxiety and say, ‘Hey, can I fly tomorrow?’” she said. “They’ll be happy to take you off.”</p><p>As the week progresses, weather in the Midwest and East Coast is expected to worsen. By late Wednesday, a storm system will establish over Tennessee, likely strengthening as it moves east into Thanksgiving Day. Precipitation will likely spread across much of the East on Thursday, including some potential for snow in the interior Northeast, especially in the higher elevations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Forecasters said Monday morning that the exact amount, precise timing and location of rainfall and snow were still questionable.</p><p>While Ms. Diaz said she would usually recommend traveling on Thanksgiving Day to avoid traffic and to get the best deals on flights, this year she expected the weather to cause a “ripple effect” of flight delays and possible emergencies on the road.</p><p>“This is the most number of people we’ve ever had traveling over Thanksgiving,” she said.</p><p>“Control what you can” this week by preparing for the worst outcomes, Ms. Diaz said, which include potentially being stuck in a vehicle or at the airport for long periods of time.</p><p>Ms. Orelus said she always keeps a coat and neck pillow with her in case she needs to nap during delays, as well as a portable charger. But she said, most importantly, “pack your patience.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
