    <h1>Videos That Purport to Show Drones in New Jersey Likely Show Planes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Starting in mid-November, a mystery began to take hold in northern New Jersey, when residents of Morris County began posting videos that appeared to show brightly lit flying objects hovering or soaring across the night sky, in some cases above their homes.</p><p>Many believed they were drones, and various theories followed, with people claiming they were part of secret government programs or even alien invasions. Within weeks, residents across several states began reporting hundreds of<span>  </span>sightings, and posting videos and photographs of their encounters.</p><p>To better understand what some New Jersey residents have likely been seeing — as well as how perceptions of objects in the night sky can be distorted — The New York Times mapped local airports, tracked air traffic patterns and, along with aviation experts, analyzed hundreds of videos of aircraft purportedly filmed in or near Morris County in November and December.<span>  </span></p><p>The vast majority of the videos appeared to show planes or helicopters, moving across a part of the state that brims with airports. None of the videos analyzed by The Times conclusively showed drones, though in some cases that remains a plausible explanation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>One video in particular, filmed in Somerset County, N.J. and posted on Facebook on Dec. 4, is an example of how difficult it can be to deduce what an object might be. It shows a helicopter and a second flying object, purported to be a drone; experts were unable to determine exactly what the object was, although they said it resembled a plane.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/autossell/helicopter-drone-NJ/helicopter-drone-NJ-threeByTwoLargeAt2X-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A video filmed in Somerset County, N.J., posted on Facebook on Dec. 4, shows a helicopter and a second flying object.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Ellen Clarke, via Facebook</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation into the wide range of purported drone sightings nationwide, and on Monday said that of the 5,000 tips they have received, many were piloted aircraft. Others were smaller planes and lawful commercial or hobbyist drones, or law enforcement drones. Only 100 tips required further examination. The F.B.I. and other federal authorities have said that the sightings do not pose a threat to public safety threat or homeland security.<span>  </span></p><p>One key factor fueling the confusion, drone and aviation experts said, is that it’s exceedingly difficult for the human eye to gauge the distance, size, and movement of flying objects at night. The red-and-green collision lights on aircraft as well as various flight tracking applications can provide observers with insights, although both have limitations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="nj-drones-scrolly-embed" data-id="100000009883448" data-source-id="100000009883448"><div slug="nj-drones-scrolly-embed" data-sourceid="100000009883448" id="embed-id-100000009883448">

Hobbyist drones are common in the U.S. and legal to fly during the day and at night, following a 2021 rule change by the Federal Aviation Administration that relaxed restrictions on night flights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>More than one million drones were <a href="https://www.faa.gov/node/54496" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registered with the F.A.A</a>. as of Dec. 2. Hundreds of thousands are registered to hobbyists, and an approximately equal share are registered commercially, such as for film production, real estate and environmental research. Many police departments also use drones. Federal officials have said that they <a href="https://www.defense.gov/news/releases/release/article/4006538/dhs-fbi-faa-dod-joint-statement-on-ongoing-response-to-reported-drone-sightings/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expect the number of drones in use to continue to rise</a> nationwide.</p><p>It can be extremely difficult to discern whether an object in the sky at night is a plane, a helicopter, a drone or something else, experts said.</p><p>Greg Pratt, a former air traffic controller and surveillance pilot for the F.B.I., who now teaches law enforcement officers how to identify and respond to drones, said that at night “your depth perception is totally unreliable,” even for those with training in identifying drones.</p><p>For that reason, it can also be challenging to gauge a flying object’s size. Something very big that is very far away, like a plane, can easily be mistaken for something smaller flying at close range, like a drone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>One video filmed in Morris County purportedly captured a drone flying close to the ground. In reality, it appears to be a United Airlines flight to Newark thousands of feet in the air.</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/autossell/Soccerball_screenshot/Soccerball_screenshot-superJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">This object, spotted over Mendham, N.J., on Dec. 3, appears to be a passenger jet flying at about 5,000 feet, according to a Times visual and flight tracking data analysis.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Alessandro Mannino</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Determining the direction of a flying object at night is also extremely difficult. The human eye has a harder time comparing the object to reference points, like the horizon or tree lines, at night than it does when it’s light out. “If you do not have something to compare against, you personally can’t tell it’s moving,” said Tombo Jones, director of the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership’s drone test site. Objects that seem to be hovering in place nearby might, in fact, be quite far away and moving very quickly.</p><p>Light patterns can offer clues. Planes and helicopters are subject to strict F.A.A. rules about what lights they must shine at night. Drones are required to shine just one light at night. So long as it is visible for three miles in the dark, a drone can display any type or configuration of lights, according to Scott Harrigan, the president of Harkin Aerial, a drone services company in Oyster Bay, N.Y. </p><p>Many drones flown in the U.S. have a similar look because the large majority are produced by a company called DJI. Its commonly purchased quadcopter models often feature a consistent lighting configuration — two red lights at the front and two green lights at the rear. The lights flash and are designed to help a pilot orient a drone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-14"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/autossell/Plane_annotation/Plane_annotation-superJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">All crewed aircraft feature a consistent lighting pattern as prescribed by the F.A.A and seen in this video.

From the ground, this pattern most often appears as a bright red flashing anti-collision light, and red and green navigation lights on the left and right wingtips, respectively. They also feature white landing lights underneath the front of the aircraft when it is preparing to land or has recently taken off. The lights seen in the videos do not appear to feature the common DJI lighting configuration.</p><p>Where the naked eye fails, flight tracking applications can help determine whether an object is a drone or a plane, and government officials have encouraged residents to consult them. Local law enforcement officers have also used them to investigate the sightings, cross referencing their observations with aircraft that appear on the applications. </p><p>The vast majority of aircraft, including this U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III seen over Brick Township, N.J., on Dec. 12, which was initially believed to be a drone, correctly report their position and are visible on flight tracking applications.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-16"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/19/autossell/IMG_7961-0-00-20-25/IMG_7961-0-00-20-25--verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">This U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III seen over Brick Township, N.J., on Dec. 12, was initially believed to be a drone.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>However, flight tracking does not capture every aircraft and the challenges judging distance at night make it easy to misinterpret the data.</p><p>While most airplanes appear on flight trackers, some do not. Small and old aircraft may not be equipped with the device the programs use to monitor planes’ locations. More than 30 percent of U.S. civil aircraft are not equipped with these devices.</p><p>An F.A.A. spokesperson confirmed those numbers, and added that “aircraft equipped with ADS-B are required to transmit at all times, with limited exceptions, like sensitive government missions.”</p><p>In three videos, New Jersey residents are seen or heard checking a flying object against a flight-tracking application. When they don’t see a plane in their vicinity, they take it as confirmation that they are looking at a drone. The Times’s analysis showed that in all three cases, the objects appeared to be planes.</p><p>Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, <a href="https://x.com/AndyKimNJ/status/1867582643346571730" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on social media</a> on Dec. 13 about his recent excursion with local law enforcement officers after dark to investigate the sightings. Parked near the Round Valley Reservoir in Hunterdon County, Mr. Kim said he and the officers often saw between five and seven lights that didn’t seem to appear on flight tracking apps. He said that they appeared to be flying low and had solid white lights or flashing red and green lights, and that the experience had made him more concerned about the U.S.’s drone detection capabilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>But, the next day, Mr. Kim <a href="https://x.com/AndyKimNJ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted that he had spoken</a> with pilots and flight experts who showed him more detailed flight tracking maps. The “deeper analysis” led Mr. Kim to conclude “that most of the possible drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes.”</p><p>Some reports of drone sightings remain unexplained and the F.B.I. investigation is ongoing. At a briefing to state lawmakers on Dec. 11, a state police official said that an officer had flown a helicopter over a drone, according to Brian Bergen, a state assemblyman who was present. The police were unable to stay with the drone for long, eventually peeling off because of safety concerns, Mr. Bergen recounted.</p><p>The state police have not commented about the episode publicly, and a spokesman referred questions about it to the F.B.I.
