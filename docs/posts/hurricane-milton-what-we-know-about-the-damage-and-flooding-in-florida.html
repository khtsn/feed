Some homes in the storm’s path were leveled — by one early estimate, more than 120 were destroyed — while other structures nearby remained intact. On the Atlantic Coast, far from the Sarasota region where the storm made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, there was severe damage from winds.</p><p>At least 12 deaths have been linked to Milton and hundreds of people have been rescued from hard-hit areas.</p><p>Nearly <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/florida" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three million customers in Florida were still without power</a> on Thursday evening as emergency crews continued restoration efforts throughout the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s how Milton affected different regions of the state.</p><h2 id="link-636448d9">Tampa Bay was spared from the worst of the storm surge but still was damaged by wind and rain.</h2><p>The Tampa Bay region did not experience disastrous storm surge, which many forecasters feared. Still, there was serious flooding in many communities along the west coast, where as much as 18 inches of rain fell, and some areas were battered.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/hurricane-milton-photos-tropicana-field-siesta-key.html?smid=url-share" title="">Before-and-after images</a> taken along the Gulf Coast showed residential streets and lawns under water, and fallen trees and debris scattered about.</p><p>In Sarasota, Clearwater and other communities, rescuers pulled people from flooded or damaged buildings and vehicles. </p><p>And in St. Petersburg, gusts of more than 100 miles per hour tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays’ Tropicana Field baseball stadium and smashed a 500-foot crane onto a building occupied by the Tampa Bay Times newspaper. The water system was another problem the city faced on Thursday — many residents were advised to boil their water until crews made repairs.</p><h2 id="link-31c2f82a">Areas of Central Florida suffered flooding.</h2><p>Significant flooding from swollen rivers and extensive power outages occurred in Central Florida after Milton moved over the region on Wednesday night. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some counties were still almost entirely without power on Thursday evening. In Highlands County, <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/county/314" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">93 percent of customers</a> did not have electricity. </p><p>Still, officials in the region said it had escaped catastrophe. In Orlando, Milton left its mark in the form of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OrlandoPolice/posts/pfbid04kstKTcso1RTbv2Spdsb3SybTznkwC8S4cMxeTSG6BLjo4pQyBn6PHUiS5cPqsCul" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downed street poles</a> and trees.

Also in that county, the sheriff’s office confirmed that four deaths were linked to the storm, including two people who died after trees fell on homes. </p><p>Patricia Mazzei<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jenna Russell<!-- -->, <!-- -->Kate Selig<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- -->, <!-- -->Annie Correal<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jennifer Reed<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Hurricane Milton</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Falsehoods Disrupt Recovery:</strong> Experts warn that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/media/hurricane-milton-helene-conspiracy-theories.html">weather-related disinformation</a> can rapidly escalate into real-world risks and distract from aid.</p></li><li><p><strong>What It Was Like in the Eye:</strong> Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/weather/hurricane-milton-eye-sarasota.html">our reporter’s account of a harrowing night in Sarasota, Fla</a>. — different from anything she has experienced as a native of New England.</p></li><li><p><strong>Over 3 Million Without Power:</strong> Downed power lines and scattered debris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/weather/hurricane-milton-power-outages-map-florida.html">caused widespread power outages in Florida</a> that may prove difficult for utility companies to repair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Would His Houseboat Survive?:</strong> A man’s boat had survived several storms the last three years.
