At least seven people were killed and hundreds were rescued from hard-hit areas. </p><p>More than <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/florida" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three million customers in Florida were still without power</a> on Thursday afternoon as emergency crews continued restoration efforts throughout the state.</p><p>Here’s how Milton affected different regions of the state. </p><h2 id="link-636448d9">Tampa Bay was spared from the worst of the storm surge but still was damaged by wind and rain. </h2><p>The Tampa Bay region appeared to have been spared from the worst of the storm surge. Still, there was still serious flooding in many communities along the west coast, where as much as 18 inches of rain fell, and some areas were battered. </p><p>“While we certainly escaped the worst of the storm surge, we certainly didn’t escape the worst of the wind and the rain last night,” said Bob Gualtieri, the Pinellas County sheriff, at a Thursday news conference. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Gualtieri said his department had received many water rescue calls overnight, but the stormy conditions proved too unsafe for emergency workers to be deployed. </p><p>In Sarasota, emergency workers rescued residents of an apartment complex where floodwaters rose to their first-floor doorknobs. </p><p>And in St. Petersburg, gusts of more than 100 miles per hour tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays’ Tropicana Field stadium and smashed a 500-foot crane onto a building occupied by The Tampa Bay Times newspaper. Other problems the city faced on Thursday included ones to its drinking water system — many residents were advised to boil their water until crews made repairs. </p><h2 id="link-31c2f82a">Areas of Central Florida suffered flooding. </h2><p>Central Florida experienced significant flooding and extensive power outages after Milton moved over the region on Wednesday night, though officials there said the region had been spared worst-case scenarios.</p><p>“I won’t marginalize the impacts that we’ve had, but relatively speaking, when we look around the state, we did not have the kind of catastrophic damage that we saw that impacted our state with Hurricane Helene and even now with Hurricane Milton,” said Jerry Demings, the mayor of Orange County, which includes Orlando. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>More than 88,500 customers lost power in the county during the storm, officials said at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=915166747137306" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Thursday news conference</a>, and while the county fared well in the storm compared to other parts of the state, Mr. Demings said there some areas experienced significant flooding. </p><p>The mayor estimated that some 600 buildings in the county had been badly damaged. </p><h2 id="link-a9f7933">There were damaging tornadoes on the east coast.</h2><p>Tornadoes spawned by Milton killed at least five people in St. Lucie County on the eastern side of the state and damaged dozens of homes in Martin County to the south of St. Lucie. </p><p>Erick Gill, a spokesman for St. Lucie County, said “more than one” of the victims resided at Spanish Lakes Country Club Village, a retirement community of mobile homes north of Fort Pierce. The authorities were still working to identify victims.</p><p>Many coastal communities on this side of the peninsula were also still reeling from the deluge of rain and surging tides on Thursday.</p><p>Officials in Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach, were still trying to reach people who were left stranded in homes in areas cut off by flooded roadways. Also in that county, the sheriff’s office confirmed that two people died after trees fell on homes during the storm.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Hurricane Milton</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Falsehoods Disrupt Recovery:</strong> Experts warn that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/media/hurricane-milton-helene-conspiracy-theories.html">weather-related disinformation</a> can rapidly escalate into real-world risks and distract from aid.</p></li><li><p><strong>What It Was Like in the Eye:</strong> Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/weather/hurricane-milton-eye-sarasota.html">our reporter’s account of a harrowing night in Sarasota, Fla</a>. — different from anything she has experienced as a native of New England.</p></li><li><p><strong>Over 3 Million Without Power:</strong> Downed power lines and scattered debris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/weather/hurricane-milton-power-outages-map-florida.html">caused widespread power outages in Florida</a> that may prove difficult for utility companies to repair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Would His Houseboat Survive?:</strong> A man’s boat had survived several storms the last three years.
