Its path of destruction was uneven, though, and in many areas, repairs were well underway by Friday.</p><p>Some places near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as farther inland, were inundated, though not to the degree that officials had feared. Many homes in the storm’s path were leveled — by one early estimate, more than 120 were destroyed — while other structures nearby remained intact. At least 14 deaths have been linked to the storm.</p><p>“We did not get the worst-case scenario,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Friday. “But we did get hit, and we’re going to have to work to bounce back.”</p><p>Here is what we know about the storm and its impact.</p><h2 id="link-206bde22">How bad was the damage from the hurricane?</h2><p>The damage varied from one county to the next. The Tampa Bay region did not experience the disastrous storm surge that many forecasters had feared. Still, there was serious flooding along the Gulf Coast, which received as much as 18 inches of rain. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/hurricane-milton-photos-tropicana-field-siesta-key.html?smid=url-share" title="">some areas were battered</a> by strong winds, particularly barrier islands in the direct path of the storm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In St. Petersburg, winds gusting to more than 100 miles an hour tore part of the roof off Tropicana Field, the home stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays, and smashed a 500-foot construction crane onto a building housing the offices of The Tampa Bay Times.</p><p>Throughout the state, around 1,200 people were rescued — mostly from flooded homes and vehicles — by state emergency workers and the Florida National Guard, which activated more than 6,500 troops, one of the largest responses to a natural disaster in state history.</p><p>Farther east, tornadoes generated by the hurricane were a deadly menace. Occurring on the opposite side of the peninsula from where Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm, the tornadoes tore through several communities ahead of the main body of the hurricane.</p><h2 id="link-194c89d4">Are tornadoes common during a hurricane?</h2><p>It is not unusual for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/hurricane-milton-tornadoes.html" title="">major hurricanes to spawn tornadoes</a>, because their outer rain bands often contain thunderstorms that can generate strong winds.</p><p>Tornadoes that accompany tropical systems are usually weak, but the ones that ripped across Florida on Wednesday were more intense than usual, meteorologists said. They were strong and lasted for a long time, cutting winding paths through several counties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That is why more than 100 structures were damaged before Milton had even come ashore, with fatal results: Tornadoes are thought to have killed at least six people in St. Lucie County, on the Atlantic Coast about 65 miles north of Palm Beach.</p><p>Some of those victims lived in a retirement community of mobile homes north of Fort Pierce, according to relatives of the victims.</p><h2 id="link-7cb460c3">Did Florida residents evacuate in time?</h2><p>As Milton churned toward Florida early in the week, the warnings from officials were dire — and they appeared to work.</p><p>The storm prompted one of the largest evacuations in state history. Some people fled on crowded highways in the days before the storm made landfall, while others made their way to shelters closer to home.</p><p>As Milton moved off into the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, officials credited the warnings for getting people out of harm’s way. “We know lifesaving measures did make a difference,” President Biden said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Another factor that probably lessened the severity of destruction is that Florida has had plenty of practice in preparing for hurricanes, and has instituted relatively strong building codes. Health care facilities in the path of the storm appeared to have fared better than expected, with most hospitals escaping serious damage.</p><p>Still, the storms that hit Florida may be getting stronger with time. Milton delivered at least 20 percent more rain and 10 percent stronger winds than a similarly rare storm would have done in a world that humans had not warmed by burning fossil fuels, <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/yet-another-hurricane-wetter-windier-and-more-destructive-because-of-climate-change/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scientists said on Friday</a>.</p><h2 id="link-606e34a">Are there still power outages across Florida?</h2><p>More than 2 million customers in Florida were still without power on Friday night, according to <a href="http://poweroutages.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poweroutages.us</a>, about two-thirds of the peak outage figure during the storm.</p><p>The good news, according to state officials, was that electricity infrastructure across Florida had generally not suffered enough damage to require a total rebuild. Melissa Seixas, the president of Duke Energy Florida, said on Friday that the necessary repairs to her company’s facilities would take days, not weeks.</p><h2 id="link-373f0966">What about cleanup and recovery?</h2><p>Debris cleanup efforts are underway in many parts of Florida, but not just because of Hurricane Milton. Mr. DeSantis said on Friday that some communities seemed to have more debris leftover from Hurricane Helene, which barreled through the state about two weeks ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Gasoline is still scarce in some areas, including Tampa, where long lines on Friday made it a chore to keep vehicle fuel tanks filled. Still, the steady hum of chain saws and generators filled the air along much of the Gulf Coast.</p><p>And while some communities were slowly getting back to normal, dangerous conditions remained. Forecasters said on Friday that river flooding was expected to continue for days, possibly weeks, in Central Florida and the Tampa Bay region.</p><p>Patricia Mazzei<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jenna Russell<!-- -->, <!-- -->Kate Selig<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- -->, <!-- -->Annie Correal<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jennifer Reed<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kate Christobek<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacey Fortin covers a wide range of subjects for the National desk of The Times, including extreme weather, court cases and state politics all across the country.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jacey-fortin">More about Jacey Fortin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
