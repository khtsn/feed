                  <p>Artemijs Rjabovs, CEO of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid1152469497">Passion UA</a>, has claimed that the organization has an option to purchase <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20903/senzu" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1313957595">Senzu</a> at the conclusion of the IEM Cologne Major if all parties are satisfied, in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgWdZlXXhrY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interview</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8686/leniniw" data-tooltip-id="uid474527279">Konstantin <span>&#34;⁠leniniw⁠&#34;</span> Sivko</a>.</p>
                  <p>&#34;The negotiations were tough because, if I’m correct, this is the first time The MongolZ sell a player,&#34; he said, in comments translated by HLTV staff.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>Later, Rjabovs alleged that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid1152469497">Passion UA</a> even outbid regional giants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4608/natus-vincere" data-tooltip-id="uid209481908">Natus Vincere</a> for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/20903/senzu" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1313957595">Senzu</a>: &#34;There were rumors about NAVI and the money they were willing to spend, and we agreed with The MongolZ on a little bit higher sum than what NAVI were offering.&#34;</p>

                  </a>
                  <p>The Latvian executive also revealed that Passion owner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/22619/zinchenko" data-tooltip-id="uid222166787">Oleksandr <span>&#34;⁠Zinchenko⁠&#34;</span> Zinchenko</a> called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19869/try" data-tooltip-id="uid329811730">Santino <span>&#34;⁠try⁠&#34;</span> Rigal</a> several times to convince him to join the project, and succeeded despite the Argentine AWPer being the subject of interest from three top-ten teams.</p>
                  <p>&#34;It was very important that [try] would join us,&#34; Rjabovs said, &#34;because we see what potential he has, how he solo carried Imperial at the Major, and we really lacked the consistency that a sniper needs to provide.&#34;</p>

                  <p>And Rjabovs certainly sees it in those terms: &#34;Two years ago: who were we?,&#34; he said. &#34;We were playing United21, and now we will have Senzu, HLTV No. 13. When I was speaking with JT, I told him he doesn’t speak English well but it will be fine, and he said &#39;the most important thing to me is that he shoots well.&#39;&#34;</p>
