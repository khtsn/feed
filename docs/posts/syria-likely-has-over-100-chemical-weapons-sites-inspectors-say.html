The figure is far higher than any that Mr. al-Assad has ever acknowledged.</p><p>The sites are suspected to have been involved in the research, manufacturing and storage of chemical weapons. Mr. al-Assad <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons-arsenal.html" title="">used</a> weapons like sarin and chlorine gas against rebel fighters and Syrian civilians during more than a decade of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/world/middleeast/syria-recovery-aleppo-douma.html" title="">civil war</a>.</p><p>The number of sites, and whether they are secured, has been a mystery since rebels toppled Mr. al-Assad last year. Now, the chemicals represent a major test for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/middleeast/syria-government-al-shara.html" title="">caretaker government</a>, which is led by the group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, but it has renounced its links to Al Qaeda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The stakes are high because of <a href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/chemical/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how deadly the weapons are</a>, particularly when used in densely populated areas. Sarin, a nerve agent, can kill within minutes. Chlorine and mustard gas, weapons made infamous in World War I, burn the eyes and skin and fill the lungs with fluid, seemingly drowning people on land.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Douma, Syria, at the site of a suspected chemical attack in 2018.

The current government allowed a team from the watchdog to enter the country this year to begin work documenting the sites, according to people with knowledge of the trip.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Syria remains in a precarious spot, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/middleeast/syria-violence.html" title="">violence erupted in the coastal region</a> in recent weeks between government forces and groups aligned with Mr. al-Assad. And despite promises, the new government has not yet appointed an ambassador to the watchdog — a key first step that is seen as a sign of a country’s commitment. Syria’s defense ministry declined to answer written questions about the weapons, saying without elaboration that the questions were not under its purview.</p><p>In the early years of the civil war, Mr. al-Assad’s government declared the locations of 27 sites to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or O.P.C.W., which sent inspectors to visit and shut them down. But Mr. al-Assad continued to use chemical weapons until at least 2018, and <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/case-studies/2018/04/19/methodology-tracked-illegal-shipment-sarin-precursor-belgium-syria/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research showed</a> that his government kept importing essential precursor chemicals.</p><p>The current estimate of more than 100 sites comes from the watchdog and has been circulated recently among experts and international nonproliferation analysts. The organization said it had arrived at the number based on outside researchers, nonprofit groups and intelligence shared by its member countries.</p><p>Some sites are probably hidden in caves or other places that are tough to find using satellite images, according to researchers, former organization staff members and other experts. That increases the likelihood that some weapons are not secured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“There are many locations that we don’t know about because the old regime was lying to the O.P.C.W.,” said Raed al-Saleh, the leader of the Syria Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, a volunteer group that says it is working with the government to try to dismantle chemical weapons sites.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Receiving treatment for a suspected chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta area of Syria in 2018.

Inspectors also want to collect evidence for their investigations into Mr. al-Assad’s repeated use of chemical weapons. International observers, independent researchers and Syrian humanitarian groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/13/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-attacks-maps-history.html" title="">have documented</a> dozens of attacks, with thousands of people, including children among the victims. The most notorious was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/world/middleeast/blasts-in-the-night-a-smell-and-a-flood-of-syrian-victims.html" title="">2013 sarin gas assault</a> on the area of Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, the capital.</p><p>Last year, Israel launched airstrikes on several Syrian regime facilities where chemical weapons were known to have been held. But it is unclear whether those strikes destroyed chemical weapons.</p><p>Mr. Shikhani and others said they worried that the strikes merely created environmental contamination and destroyed evidence. International groups hope that chemical evidence will answer key questions about the Assad government’s research and help with international prosecutions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The Israeli attacks that happened right after the fall of Assad are probably likely to not have put a dent in some of this, and potentially also obscured efforts toward accountability,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>Sarin gas is prohibited under international law. The rules are murkier for other chemicals. Chlorine gas, for instance, can be created using common household cleaning products. That makes it nearly impossible to regulate the sale of precursors.</p><p>Syria’s chemical weapons program began in the 1970s with the help of hundreds of government scientists, many of whom were trained in Germany and other parts of Europe, according to a Syrian former senior government chemist who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.</p><p>The scientist worked in the chemical weapons division of the military’s Scientific Studies and Research Center. That center, which is under international sanctions, worked on conventional, chemical and nuclear arms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inspecting the site of a possible chemical weapons attack in 2013 in Zamalka, Syria.

They have heard such assurances in Syria before.</p><p>Syria first agreed to get rid of chemical weapons more than a decade ago. But as inspectors conducted their work, they became convinced that Mr. al-Assad had no intention of revealing complete information about his stockpiles.

Two Syrians who were in the convoy accused the government of misleading them and assuring them the route was safe. Other staff members recalled being constantly afraid that the government was eavesdropping on their conversations or spying on them.</p><p>Mr. al-Assad’s government also covered up attacks in which it used sarin and chlorine gas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/25/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-attack-douma.html" title="">on its own people</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In the town of Zamalka, near Damascus, headstones mark the names of many residents killed during the war, and the dates of their deaths.
