And none is more affected by geopolitics.</p><p>That’s because the United States consumes more olive oil than any other country except Italy, but produces very little of it. About 97 percent of the olive oil sold in America is imported, most of it from Spain and Italy.</p><p>So President-elect Donald J. Trump’s repeated vows to impose hefty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">tariffs</a> on imported goods have unsettled the $14 billion global industry. Mr. Trump sees tariffs as a twin-engine machine that can be used <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/us/politics/trump-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">both</a> to protect American businesses from competition and to punish uncooperative trading partners — and he has used them against European olive oil producers <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2020/01/23/inenglish/1579785432_071027.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">before</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But many olive oil producers say tariffs will force them to raise prices at a time when Americans are already reeling from inflation at the grocery store. Since 2021, the average price of a liter of olive oil at an American supermarket has nearly doubled, from about $10 per liter to nearly $20, according to the Nielsen research firm.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Top producers grow and press olives in many countries, to guard against turbulent geopolitics and climate change.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Filippo Berio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump hasn’t specified which products, or countries, will be subject to tariffs, though he has threatened to impose a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico. During his first administration, olive oil bottled in Spain — which supplies nearly half of the world’s olive oil — was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/airbus-tariffs-wto.html" title="">subject</a> to a 25 percent tariff as part of a continuing trade dispute. Under President Biden, that tariff was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/business/US-EU-Airbus-Boeing.html?searchResultPosition=14" title="">suspended</a> in 2021, but could be reinstated.</p><p>“It’s clear Trump thinks that tariffs are a very useful tool and he’s going to use them,” said Joseph Profaci, executive director of the North American Olive Oil <a href="https://www.aboutoliveoil.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Association</a>, a promotional group funded by both domestic and international producers. “I’m not going to say that he’s wrong, but we now have an opportunity to try to persuade him that olive oil really shouldn’t fit into that scheme of economic policy.”</p><p>The talk of tariffs comes just as producers around the world who export olive oil to the United States were taking their first easy breaths since March 2020, when the global shutdown of the hospitality industry in response to Covid-19 sent demand plummeting.</p><p>Before the pandemic, U.S. sales of olive oil had hit a new peak, quadrupling between 2000 and 2020 from 100,000 to 400,000 metric tons. But in both 2021 and 2022, the Mediterranean region — especially Spain, which produces 45 percent of the world’s olive oil — experienced extreme heat and drought that devastated the harvest and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/business/olive-oil-price.html" title="">pushed</a> prices up. Worldwide consumption dropped precipitously.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This year, the outlook was brightening. The 2024 harvest in the Mediterranean region, which begins in September, has been strong (except in Italy, where the pathogen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/world/europe/fear-of-ruin-as-disease-takes-hold-of-italys-olive-trees.html" title="">Xylella fastidiosa</a> continues to kill off millions of trees each year). Significantly lower prices were predicted to take effect this winter, when the new oil will arrive in markets everywhere.</p><p>Then Mr. Trump was re-elected, upending expectations for 2025 and beyond. If tariffs go into effect, will they improve the outlook for American producers and consumers?</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the first Trump administration, olive oil bottled in Spain was subject to a 25 percent tariff. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Filippo Berio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Samantha Dorsey, who has managed the pioneering California producer <a href="https://www.mcevoyranch.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McEvoy Ranch</a> in Petaluma for 23 years, said the company supports any government policy that helps farmers and promotes American food security. But she doesn’t see any immediate benefit for domestic olive oil producers from tariffs.</p><p>“This kind of change takes longer than one election cycle to accomplish,” she said.</p><p>This is partly because olive trees are slow growers; it takes at least five years from planting for a tree to bear full fruit, so ramping up production would take time (though such efforts are underway in California, <a href="https://www.oliveoiltimes.com/production/u-s-producers-weathered-a-difficult-season-and-emerged-with-good-results/118973" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Texas</a> and <a href="https://www.oliveoiltimes.com/production/georgias-largest-olive-oil-producer-gears-up-for-its-very-early-harvest/121215" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, among other places). More than tariffs, she said, the cost of domestic olive oil is affected by inflation, rising labor costs and climate change around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A giant global producer like Filippo Berio is better protected from the vagaries of markets, climate and geopolitics. Marco DeFeo, the company’s head of U.S. marketing, said the company learned during the last Trump administration to maintain robust sources outside the European Union.</p><p>In the previous round of tariffs, only bottled oil was taxed, but bulk oil was exempt. So Filippo Berio, which has bottling plants in the United States, could bring in oil from all over the world, including from its growers in Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey (places that had a banner year), and all of those would be exempt from tariffs.</p><p>Leandro Ravetti is the technical director of Boundary Bend, an Australian producer that began making olive oil in California in 2014. Its <a href="https://cooc.com/boundary-bend-cobram-estate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cobram Estate</a> extra-virgin oil has been marketed aggressively, scooping up prizes and quickly making the company one of the biggest producers in the United States. He said the European Union’s subsidies for agriculture, and its prohibitive import fees, create an unfair advantage in the global market.</p><p>“If we want to sell our California oil or our Australian oil in Europe, not only we are competing against a subsidized price, but also we have to pay extra,” he said. “All we want is a level playing field.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Skyler Mapes and her husband, Giuseppe Morisani, grow olives on his family farm in Calabria for their quarterly subscription service, Exau.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Francesco Guerra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Skyler Mapes disagrees, saying tariffs would be unfair to small European producers, who receive no subsidies. Ms. Mapes is the co-founder of <a href="https://exauoliveoil.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Exau</a>, a quarterly olive oil subscription service that sells directly to North American consumers. She and her husband, Giuseppe Morisani, divide their time between Austin, Texas, and his native Calabria, where they produce organic extra-virgin oil on his family farm. They have just finished their seventh harvest; the olives are at the mill, or frantoio, waiting to be crushed and bottled.</p><p>“There’s no way we can hurry up the process to ship in advance of the inauguration,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Mapes said tariffs could actually punish producers in the United States because state-of-the-art milling technology is produced only in Europe. Importing necessary equipment like two-phase extractors and malaxers would become prohibitively expensive. (Malaxing is the process of kneading the paste of crushed olives to release the oils; it is also used for extracting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/dining/buttermilk-often-maligned-begins-to-get-its-due.html" title="">buttermilk</a> from butter.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Small European producers rarely receive government subsidies, so Ms. Mapes of Exau said that tariffs would unfairly punish her business.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Francesco Guerra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Profaci of the North American Olive Oil Association said his group was contemplating an effort to have olive oil reclassified as a fresh product, like orange juice, that could be exempt from tariffs, and looking to corresponding groups, like the <a href="https://hassavocadoboard.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hass Avocado Board</a> and the <a href="https://www.mango.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mango Board</a>, for recent lessons on marketing an imported food as an American staple.</p><p>Mr. Ravetti and other producers said that if the federal government really wanted to help domestic producers, the U.S. Department of Agriculture could create legally enforceable standards for olive oil, similar to existing ones for butter and other foods, that help keep adulterated or substandard products off the market. (Australia implemented such a system in 2011.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/world/europe/olive-oil-fraud-italy-spain.html" title="">Fraud</a> has long been rampant across the industry. In the United States, any brand can use packaging that suggests a premium product while bottling cheap or even rancid oil, from anywhere in the world.</p><p>“The temptation is always there” for bad actors, he said. “They are looking at an expensive product that is relatively easy to get adulterated or bought at a cheaper price, and selling it with very little risk of consequences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-18"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Moskin covers everything related to restaurants, chefs, food and cooking for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julia-moskin">More about Julia Moskin</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/18/dining/olive-oil-tariffs.html">97</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Our reporters and editors traveled to nearly every state for our annual list of America’s best restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-restaurants-america.html">These are our 50 favorite places for 2024</a>.</p></li><li><p>We launched New York Times Cooking 10 years ago.
