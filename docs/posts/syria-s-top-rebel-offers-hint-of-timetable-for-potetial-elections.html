    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Syria’s de facto new leader has said it could take up to four years to hold elections, offering the first potential timetable for a transition of power following the overthrow of the country’s longtime ruler, President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/syria-hts-jolani.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">Ahmed al-Shara</a>, who has been setting up an administration in Damascus after leading the rebel offensive that toppled Mr. al-Assad, told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel that it will take time to set the conditions for a vote after decades of dictatorship.</p><p>A new constitution must be drafted first, he said, which “may take two or three years.”</p><p>“It should not be fast food,” he told the broadcaster, in an interview that aired on Sunday. “It should be drafted with great care.”</p><p>Beyond <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/16/world/syria-assad-rebels-news?searchResultPosition=8#syria-al-sharah" title="">reiterating</a> that committees would be formed and specialized experts would be consulted, Mr. al-Shara did not offer much clarity on what the electoral process would look like. He noted though that “valid elections will require a comprehensive population census,” which also “requires time.”</p></div></div>
