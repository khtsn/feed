She will call for a tax incentive to build starter homes, seek to cap the cost of insulin at $35 for all Americans and attempt to reduce the cost of health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Taken together, her plan represents more of a reboot of President Biden’s economic policy than a radically fresh start — a new sales pitch focused on its most popular aspects, not a new vision. Many of the policies reiterate or build on proposals in Mr. Biden’s most recent presidential budget. Harris campaign officials released scattered details, leaving key questions unanswered — like the income cutoff for families to qualify for a new $6,000 child tax credit for newborns, or what exactly would qualify as grocery-store “price gouging” under a federal ban.</p><p>Campaign officials did not detail how Ms. Harris would pay for her spending and tax-cut proposals in their release ahead of the speech. But they said her overall plan would reduce projected federal deficits, like Mr. Biden’s latest budget proposed to do, largely by “asking the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations to pay their fair share.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>In terms of emphasis, her speech is expected to shift away from Mr. Biden’s focus on job creation, particularly in manufacturing, and more toward reining in the cost of living.</p><p>And she will also try to paint a strong contrast against former President Donald J. Trump, describing him as a friend to billionaires and chief executives who will not help the middle class. Ms. Harris has been attacking Mr. Trump’s proposal to impose new tariffs of up to 20 percent on all imported goods, saying it would amount to a tax increase on working families.</p><p>Concerns about rising inflation and high prices are at the top of voters’ minds. But Mr. Biden sometimes struggled to balance empathy for those frustrations alongside big-picture indicators like low unemployment and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/business/economy/us-gdp-economy-inflation.html" title="">fast growth</a> that reflect a strong economy.</p><p>Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has tried to tie Ms. Harris to Biden administration policies that he said fueled inflation. Voters still give the former president higher marks on the economy than Ms. Harris. (The root causes driving higher prices are far more complex than Mr. Trump has suggested, and inflation has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/cpi-inflation-july.html#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Price%20Index%20reading,over%2Dyear%20increase%20since%202021." title="">slowed</a> significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic.)</p><p>Now, thanks to her late ascent to the top of the ticket, Ms. Harris has a chance to quickly redefine her vision for the economy without the burden of being a true incumbent.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Many of her proposals expand on policies previously pitched by Mr. Biden and would require congressional legislation, which could be an uphill battle unless Democrats win clear majorities in the House and the Senate in November.</p><p>In Raleigh, Ms. Harris will call for the restoration of a $3,600 child tax credit for lower-income and middle-class families. Mr. Biden’s 2021 stimulus legislation funded a one-year expansion of the child credit to those levels, but it expired at the end of that year, and Democrats could not muster the votes to extend it. Mr. Biden’s most recent budget called for another temporary extension.</p><p>Ms. Harris appears to be calling to make the expansion permanent. Depending on which families qualify for the credit, that move that could add nearly $1 trillion to federal budget deficits over the next decade if it is not offset by spending cuts or other tax increases, according to the <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/tax-extensions-wipe-away-presidents-budget-savings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center for a Responsible Federal Budget in Washington</a>.</p><p>The vice president will also propose a more lucrative credit for parents in the first year of a new child’s life. Taken together, those plans would slice heavily into the projected $3 trillion of deficit reduction in Mr. Biden’s budget, unless Ms. Harris plans more tax increases or spending cuts than Mr. Biden proposed.</p><p>Other proposals could also cut significantly into Mr. Biden’s proposed deficit savings — or erase them entirely — by increasing federal spending. To address the national housing shortage, Ms. Harris plans to call for the construction of three million new housing units in the next four years, an increase from the two million new homes that Mr. Biden promised during his re-election campaign.</p></div></div><div><div><p>She will provide up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers and expand an existing tax incentive for developers who build affordable rental housing. She will also a propose a $40 billion fund to invest in local solutions to the housing crisis, doubling the investment sought by Mr. Biden. Ms. Harris would offer that assistance to any eligible first-time buyer who has paid rent on time for two years.</p><p>Last year, about 1.5 million homes were purchased by <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/highlights-from-the-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers#homebuyers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first-time buyers</a>, according to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/quick-real-estate-statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statistics from the National Association of Realtor</a>s. Harris campaign officials estimate her plan would help four million first-time buyers over four years, which would suggest a cost of at least $250 billion over a decade.</p><p>Ms. Harris will also seek to remove tax benefits for Wall Street investors who bulk buy single-family rental homes, as well as to prevent corporate landlords from using algorithmic price-setting tools to increase rents by large margins.</p><p>On health care, Ms. Harris is following Mr. Biden’s lead in trying to cap insulin prices at $35 and out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs at $2,000 for all Americans. Those limits apply just to seniors and are among Mr. Biden’s most popular accomplishments as president. She also intends to work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans.</p><p>Before Mr. Biden dropped out, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/politics/biden-inflation-greedflation-economy.html" title="">many Democrats had urged him</a> to lean more into an argument that corporate greed, or “greedflation,” was driving price increases in many sectors, although the economic evidence for that is mixed. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Harris’s newly revealed agenda suggests she may be more aggressive, at least rhetorically. Standing alongside Mr. Biden on Thursday at an event celebrating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/harris-biden-drug-prices-medicare.html" title="">a victory on prescription drug prices</a>, she reminded the audience of her efforts as the attorney general of California.</p><p>“I took on pharmaceutical companies for deceptive marketing and illegally inflating the cost of drugs,” Ms. Harris said. “And we won billions of dollars.”</p><p>At the same time, she will have to guard against attacks from the right. Mr. Trump has argued that Ms. Harris’s economic plans are dangerously liberal, even though many of them are broadly popular with voters, surveys have found.</p><p>“She is running on the Maduro plan,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference.html" title="">said</a> at a news conference in Bedminster, N.J., on Thursday, referring to Nicolás Maduro, the autocratic left-wing president of Venezuela. “We call it the Maduro plan. Like something straight out of Venezuela or the Soviet Union.”</p><p>Although Ms. Harris will need help from Congress to deliver on her agenda, there are indications that members of both parties could work together, particularly on issues like housing.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Jim Parrott, who served as a senior adviser on the National Economic Council during the Obama administration, said there had been some bipartisan consensus in recent years that housing supply was an issue.</p><p>“Both sides of the aisle agree that we have a housing affordability problem,” Mr. Parrott said.</p><p>Jeanna Smialek<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Tankersley writes about economic policy at the White House and how it affects the country and the world.
