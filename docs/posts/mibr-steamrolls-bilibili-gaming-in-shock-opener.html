<p>Expectations were surely measured for both sides: BLG has never made a dent internationally, but landed in France as regional champions for the first time in their history. MIBR, meanwhile, is capping off what has been an incredible year for the team.</p>

<p>MIBR were known as one of the worst teams of the Americas in their first two years, but offseason changes morphed them into a top contender this year, with two consecutive third-place finishes and a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025" target="_blank">Toronto</a> presence nailing them enough points to be in Paris fighting for the world title.</p>

<p>But in France? They look like one of the best teams in the world. With just 11 rounds lost in two maps, MIBR flawlessly took down BLG, China&#39;s #1 seed. They won BLG&#39;s pick of Haven 13-2 and went on to finish the match on Corrode with a 13-9 win.</p>

<p>MIBR also fought for regional pride. Only one of their counterparts won their opening match in what was one of the biggest upsets of the first round of groups. The Brazilian squad came in and steamrolled China&#39;s #1 seed in one of the most lop-sided matches of the tournament so far.</p>

<p>The match looked to get off to, quite literally, an even start: the teams were tied up 2-2 in the first few rounds of Haven, BLG&#39;s pick. MIBR got two more, prompting their opponents to take a timeout. But MIBR kept winning rounds.</p>

<p>And they kept winning. And winning. In the blink of an eye, BLG were staring at the defeat screen faster than they could say it. Those two rounds they got in the beginning of the map were the only ones they got.</p>

<p>Somehow, Corrode went down very similarly. The match was neck-and-neck until MIBR suddenly shifted gears and cruised to a win. It took them until the second half to do so, when an ace from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/8480/aspas">
		aspas	</a>
</span> firmly put MIBR in control of the match and let them ride out a 13-9 win.</p>

<p>The Brazilian&#39;s ace felt like pointing a big neon sign at his name to remind everyone who the former world champion is. On Corrode alone he got up to a 1.52 rating, thanks to accruing 22 kills across a stunning +11 differential.</p>

<p>Somehow, that wasn&#39;t even his or his team&#39;s best rating of the match. That happened on Haven, expectedly, where <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/21668/verno">
		Verno	</a>
</span> recorded a flat 2.0 rating and aspas himself a higher 1.56 rating. Both of them owe these figures to how little they died, especially Verno: in 15 rounds, he died just three times.</p>


<p><em>He never left.</em></p>

<p>Upsets are not news in the VCT. Dozens of them have happened across the many international  tournaments and regional matches, but they often have an asterisk to them. It could range from the losers having an off day, the winners having a great day, the nature of the competition, among so many others.</p>

<p>Not many of those games are framed quite like this one. MIBR spent the past two years in the dumps. Their first LAN outing saw them debut against a title contender in <span data-ref-id="4">

</span>. It&#39;s been a rough and long trek for this squad and the name on their chests.</p>

<p>But now that they have one of the best teams of their group — maybe the entire tournament — out of their way, what can MIBR cook up for Champions Paris?</p>
