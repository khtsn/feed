Looking grim, murmuring “incredible,” she walked briskly out of the courtroom before the judges had given her exact sentence.</p><p>She did not address the dozens of camera crews that awaited her outside the courtroom, but she was expected to speak on French television later on Monday evening.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen, 56, was also sentenced to four years in prison, with two of those years suspended, and a fine of 100,000 euros, or about $108,000. She has long denied any wrongdoing in the case, which involved accusations that her party, the National Rally, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/le-pen-eu-france-embezzlement-trial.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">illegally used several million euros</a> in European Parliament funds for party expenses between 2004 and 2016.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She is widely expected to appeal the verdict, which would put most of her sentence on hold. But the court ruled that her electoral ineligibility is effective immediately. As a result, only a successful appeal before the 2027 deadline to enter the race would allow her to run.</p><p>That is not impossible, but it will be difficult. The appeals process is slow in France, and even if a new trial took take place before the 2027 election, it is unclear whether the prosecution’s case would be overturned.</p><p>Some politicians, even those opposed to Ms. Le Pen, have expressed fears that barring her from competing in the presidential race, despite her party’s popularity, could fuel a democratic crisis. The ruling does nothing to prevent her protégé, Jordan Bardella, 29, from running.</p><p>The verdict could usher in a period of renewed political turmoil if Ms. Le Pen decides to lash out against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/europe/france-government-no-confidence-vote.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">France’s fragile government</a> or if anger spills over into the streets. The government struggled to pass a budget this year and could still be toppled at any time by lawmakers in the lower house, where Ms. Le Pen’s party is the single largest.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
