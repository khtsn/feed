decisive steps to curb abuse of the prescription painkillers that had fueled Americaâs overdose crisis. The company said it was âputting the brakes on the opioid epidemicâ by making it harder to get potentially dangerous amounts of the drugs.</p><p>The announcement, which came after pressure from federal health regulators, was followed by similar declarations from the other two companies that control access to prescription drugs for most Americans.</p><p>The self-congratulatory statements, however, didnât address an important question: Why hadnât the middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers, acted sooner to address a crisis that had been building for decades?</p><p>One reason, a New York Times investigation found: Drugmakers had been paying them not to.</p><p>For years, the benefit managers, or P.B.M.s, took payments from opioid manufacturers, including Purdue Pharma, in return for not restricting the flow of pills. As tens of thousands of Americans overdosed and died from prescription painkillers, the middlemen collected billions of dollars in payments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The details of these backroom deals â laid out in hundreds of documents, some previously confidential, reviewed by The Times â expose a mostly untold chapter of the opioid epidemic and provide a rare look at the modus operandi of the companies at the heart of the prescription drug supply chain.</p><p>The P.B.M.s exert extraordinary control over what drugs people can receive and at what price. The three dominant companies â Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Optum Rx â oversee prescriptions for more than 200 million people and are part of health care conglomerates that sit near the top of the Fortune 500 list.</p><p>The P.B.M.s are hired by insurers and employers to control their drug costs by negotiating discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/business/prescription-drug-costs-pbm.html" title="">a Times investigation this year</a> found that they often pursue their own financial interests in ways that increase costs for patients, employers and government programs, while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/business/drugstores-closing-pbm-pharmacy.html" title="">driving independent pharmacies</a> out of business.

The company didnât want doctors to have to provide additional justification for prescribing a powerful narcotic, and it didnât want strict limits on the number of pills that could be dispensed.</p><p>The approach worked. Purdue repeatedly boasted in internal reports that prescribers and patients faced few or no restrictions on access to the drug.</p><p>What could have been a backstop against overprescribing instead became a sales tool, records show. After striking deals with P.B.M.s, drugmakers touted the favorable coverage â no second-guessing or paperwork requirements from insurers â as part of an effort to get doctors to write more prescriptions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even as the epidemic worsened, the P.B.M.s collected ever-growing sums. The largest of the middlemen bought competitors and used their increasing leverage not to insist on safeguards but to extract more rebates and fees. From 2003 to 2012, for example, the amount Purdue was paying P.B.M.s in rebates roughly doubled to about $400 million a year, almost all of it for OxyContin.</p><p>The documents reviewed by The Times â including contracts, invoices, emails, memos and financial data â span more than two decades, beginning with the debut of OxyContin in 1996. Many came from a <a href="https://industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/opioids/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public repository</a> of records unearthed during court cases and investigations. The Times also obtained more than 200 previously confidential documents from plaintiffs in litigation against drugmakers, P.B.M.s and others.</p><p>In the public assignment of blame for the opioid epidemic, the P.B.M.s have largely escaped notice. Drugmakers, distributors, pharmacies and doctors have paid billions of dollars to resolve lawsuits and investigations. But more recently, the largest P.B.M.s have been in the legal cross hairs.</p><p>In statements, the P.B.M.s said they had long worked to prevent opioid abuse, while also ensuring that people in serious pain had access to the drugs. They said that for years they had offered their clients â employers, insurers and state and federal programs like Medicaid â the option to impose restrictions on opioids.</p><p>Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts, said most clients had instituted some sort of safeguards for opioids. âUltimately, our clients control their formularies and all aspects of their drug benefits,â she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But this often presented the clients with a fraught choice: If they added restrictions, they could lose the rebates that helped make coverage affordable.</p><p>In addition, documents show that P.B.M.s sometimes collaborated with opioid manufacturers to persuade insurers not to restrict access to their drugs.</p><p>âOur work behind the scenes is paying off!â one Purdue executive emailed a colleague in 2003, recounting how she had worked with P.B.M.s that later became part of CVS Caremark and Express Scripts to persuade insurers to lift restrictions on OxyContin.</p><p>The opioid manufacturer Mallinckrodt similarly credited its collaboration with P.B.M.s with preventing two large insurance companies from imposing restrictions in 2015. âThis is a best practice of how to reverse a negative decision,â a Mallinckrodt executive emailed colleagues.</p><p>Spokeswomen for Purdue and Mallinckrodt declined to comment.</p><p>Employees at Express Scripts and Optum Rx at times raised concerns that rebates were trumping safety considerations, internal emails show.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2017, for example, an Optum Rx executive proposed immediately restricting access to the painkiller Opana ER because it was going to be pulled from the market for safety reasons. It was important to prevent new patients from beginning to use the drug in the months before the withdrawal took effect, he wrote.</p><p>But another executive objected. âWe currently get rebates,â he wrote, âand that would put our rebates at risk.â</p><h2 id="link-662880c0">Squelching the Pushback</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The years following the 1996 rollout of OxyContin proved to be a critical period in the nascent opioid epidemic.</p><p>In response to rising costs and news coverage about addiction and abuse, some insurers began restricting access to the drug, requiring doctors to seek authorization before they could write some prescriptions or limiting the number of pills that could be prescribed to a patient each month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For Purdue, this posed a serious threat. The restrictions, the company noted in an internal planning document, will âcreate barriers to OxyContin being able to achieve significant growth.â</p><p>To knock down these barriers, Purdue needed to win over the middlemen, which held sway over insurers and other clients that counted on the rebates that the P.B.M.s shared with them.</p><p>Purdue forged what executives described internally as a âpartnershipâ with Express Scripts and a âspecial arrangementâ with Merck-Medco, one of the nationâs largest P.B.M.s at the time. Together, the drugmaker and the middlemen disseminated purportedly independent guidance on pain management, including a mailing to doctors from Express Scripts that was meant to, in Purdueâs words, âsquelch the anti-OxyContin pushback.â</p><p>In 1999, when Purdue struck a similar deal with AdvancePCS, the third of the big P.B.M.s at the time, a Purdue sales executive, James Lang, celebrated: âWe want to make OxyContin a billion-dollar drug in two years. This will help.â</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>âThis is amazing,â Purdueâs president, Richard Sackler, replied.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Purdue didnât want doctors to have to provide additional justification for prescribing OxyContin, its blockbuster painkiller.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Frey/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Rebates formed the cornerstone of the relationships. In 2001, as OxyContin abuse made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/05/business/sales-of-painkiller-grew-rapidly-but-success-brought-a-high-cost.html" title="">national headlines</a> and regulators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/us/us-asks-painkiller-maker-to-help-curb-wide-abuse.html" title="">began trying to crack down</a>, Purdue paid rebates of more than $31 million to Merck-Medco and $25 million to Express Scripts. By 2003, Purdueâs total rebates to P.B.M.s reached almost $200 million. (Merck-Medco later became part of Express Scripts, and AdvancePCS became part of CVS Caremark.)</p><p>Because the P.B.M.s often shared a portion of the rebates with the insurers and employers that hired them, these clients had a financial incentive not to impose restrictions. Purdue and the P.B.M.s sometimes reminded clients of this when they considered limiting access.</p><p>In a 2003 email, a Purdue executive, Bernadette Katsur, listed insurers that had abandoned planned restrictions on OxyContin â âproof of our success in working behind the scenes,â she wrote.</p><p>By teaming up with AdvancePCS, she wrote in another email, âwe have eliminated many attemptsâ to restrict access to the painkiller. Another Purdue manager relayed a Merck-Medco executiveâs account of the power of rebates: âThe reason they have been able to keep various clients from placingâ restrictions on OxyContin âhas been the value of the rebates to them.â</p><p>An important test came in 2003. At a meeting with Purdue, an executive for the insurer UnitedHealthcare raised concerns about abuse of OxyContin, noting that some patients were being prescribed as many as 1,000 pills a month. The insurance company planned to limit prescriptions to 60 pills; doctors would need to call to get authorization for higher amounts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>For help, Purdue turned to Merck-Medco, the P.B.M. that UnitedHealthcare had hired to handle prescription drug benefits for its customers. The effort culminated in a meeting at UnitedHealth Groupâs offices. A Merck-Medco official delivered a presentation on the âpotential loss of rebatesâ to the insurer if it went forward with the limit, an executive for the P.B.M. reported to Purdue. âThat information convinced the UHG team to change,â he wrote.</p><p>The insurer imposed a limit of 124 pills, more than double what it had previously planned.</p><h2 id="link-20f9c671">Removing Barriers</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Harris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Other drug companies adopted similar tactics â a playbook that would prove effective even as the opioid epidemic spread.</p><p>A manager at the drugmaker Mallinckrodt succinctly explained the access game to colleagues in 2012, after a group of large insurers imposed restrictions on one of the companyâs painkillers. âWe need to remove the barrier to growth, and that will require us to âpay to play,ââ the manager wrote.</p><p>Express Scripts, the P.B.M. for the insurance plans, helped arrange a ârebate enhancement,â and the insurers loosened the restrictions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Purdue and other leading drugmakers focused on avoiding two types of restrictions. The first was the requirement that doctors provide additional evidence to insurance companies or P.B.M.s that powerful painkillers were warranted.</p><p>In 2014, a large Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in New Jersey imposed such a requirement on Mallinckrodtâs drug Xartemis XR because of âsafety, policy and chronic use concerns,â the drugmaker noted in an internal presentation. But after âassertive actionâ by Mallinckrodt and a P.B.M. called Prime Therapeutics, the Blue Cross Blue Shield plan âquickly reversed the decision.â</p><p>A second priority for opioid manufacturers was to ease limits on the number of pills that could be dispensed. As some insurers tried to slow the flood of pills fueling the epidemic, manufacturers pushed for limits that were often well above the Food and Drug Administration-approved dosing guidelines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A manager at the drugmaker Mallinckrodt discussed the need to âpay to playâ to avoid restrictions on its opioids.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Neeta Satam for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Purdue argued that P.B.M.s should allow patients to get at least 320 milligrams of OxyContin per day.
