    <h1>Best Practices</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Every app I use is trying to get me to start a streak. My Kindle praises me when I read a few days in a row. The New York Times Games app gives me gold stars if I do the crossword puzzle every morning. The clothing resale site Poshmark offers me a vague promise of “rewards” if I keep listing my old pants at a regular cadence. I like to think of myself as a person who can’t be swayed by shallow blandishments, but I am attracted to these incentives. I’m a pleaser. If there’s a good grade to be gotten, I want the A.</p><p>In her recent Times story <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/well/mind/habit-building-streak.html" title="">about the benefits of streaks</a>, Nell McShane Wulfhart humbly admits that she has run at least a mile a day for seven years and counting. I read this with a combination of awe and self-recrimination. She even ran her mile when she had Covid! She once ran it naked in a hotel room! This commitment to consistency and fitness seems noble, almost heroic. What am I doing with my life (besides selling my old pants)?</p><p>Well, I am flossing my teeth. I haven’t flossed every single day for seven years, but I have flossed every day since the last time I went to the dentist, which was several months ago, and the pride I feel in this streak is completely out of proportion with the size of the achievement. I wouldn’t dare miss a day at this point, not because I’m worried about tartar buildup, but because of how wildly good it feels, at the end of even the worst day, to be able to say, “Well, at least I have my flossing streak.” I’m aware this sounds pathetic, but it works for me.</p><p>Once you’re on a roll, each day that you add to your streak feels like a prize, an economist told Wulfhart. Of course you want to continue — there’s so little in life that offers regular, guaranteed wins. Then there’s the loss-aversion motivator: “Research shows that once you’re on a streak, the fear of losing it is stronger than the motivating power of just gaining another day,” Wulfhart writes. Yes, it feels good to tick off another day of flossing, but the idea of losing my months of perfect performance, the disappointment I’d feel in myself if I went back to being a mere mortal with no special dental regimen, keeps me at it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>We learn to love streaks as children, when good habits are gamified and there’s no feeling so pleasurable as seeing the accumulation of metallic star stickers on a chart. Do we ever outgrow this? It’s tempting to observe the patterns of one’s life and think, Where might I start a streak? You’re looking for things you’re already doing that you could continue to do regularly. You’re actively identifying things you can do that will make you proud of you.</p><p>Streaks are really just rituals dressed up in the language of self-optimization. A meditation streak is the same as a meditation practice, only with different framing. Whether we call the activity a streak or a practice, a ritual or a ceremony, it’s serving a similar purpose: adding structure, purpose, predictability, meaning to our days.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><p>Politics</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump gave Elon Musk a golden key emblazoned with the White House insignia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Knicks watch party in Central Park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kent J.

Strangers high-five at the bodega; Manhattan avenues transform into St. Peter’s Square.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And if the Knicks win tonight, they will somehow, shockingly, sit one victory away from the N.B.A. finals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/13/nyregion/with-run-against-the-odds-knicks-turn-fans-into-believers.html" title="">for the first time since 1999</a>. And if they lose, well, that will be the end of another heartbreaking season.</p><p>It’s that double helix — joy and despair, woven together — that characterizes the Knicks right now. That there’s any joy at all is a glorious change, since the Knicks have overdosed on despair for the last 25 years. (I happen to have moved to New York 26 years ago. You can send me condolence baskets.)</p><p>The Knicks have been on an intoxicating run for weeks now, and blue-and-orange caps are sprouting on city sidewalks like spring flowers. Through six weeks of playoffs, the city has rejoiced in the team’s stunning comebacks and <em>did-you-see-that?!!</em> heroics. But this Knicks team is also deeply maddening. We’ll be groaning for years about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6374286/2025/05/22/knicks-collapse-pacers-game-1/" title="">that fourth quarter when they fell asleep on the court</a> and gave up a 14-point lead in three minutes.</p><p>Intoxicating and maddening, both. Doesn’t that characterize life in New York, too? There is no place more electric; there is no place more grueling. It wouldn’t make sense for New York basketball fans to back a team that makes winning look easy because nothing is easy here. Watching these Knicks can feel like taking a long, hard look in the mirror. Sometimes you like what you see. Sometimes you don’t.</p><p>If the Knicks manage to beat the Pacers, it will almost certainly be thanks to their everyman superstar, Jalen Brunson. If most N.B.A. heroes look like Hercules in a tank top, Brunson, at 6-foot-2, could be just another commuter on the A train. His herky-jerky style of play is maddening for opponents. And it’s intoxicating for us.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Gregory-Rivera for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>The Met’s redesigned Rockefeller wing — filled with works from Africa, the Americas and Oceania — reopens today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/arts/design/michael-rockefeller-metropolitan-africa-oceania-americas.html" title="">See inside</a>.</p></li><li><p>Koyo Kouoh had spent months preparing the Venice Biennale’s main exhibition before she died this month.

It is, centrally, a documentary about Pavement, a band that made some of the best rock music of the 1990s. But it’s so much more, and so much stranger. Part of the movie is a jukebox musical, like Green Day’s “American Idiot.” Another part is a glossy, melodramatic Hollywood biopic. And another is a feature on a pop-up museum exhibition about the band. All three of these elements are parodies, spoofing the silly ways we mythologize the music of our youth; all three also evoke genuine emotion. Pavement’s music is a tangle of irony and sincerity, of incredible effort and cool detachment. It’s fitting that the movie about them is the very same.</p><p>Here is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/movies/pavements-documentary.html" title="">our review of the film</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/movies/pavements-movie-film-alex-ross-perry.html" title="">an interview with its director</a>.
