Tim Walz of Minnesota, had generally avoided news media interviews for weeks after she replaced President Biden as the Democratic nominee and added Mr. Walz to the ticket.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last month, Ms. Harris’s top aides said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/us/politics/kamala-harris-media-strategy.html" title="">she would soon embark on a robust media tour</a>, though one unlikely to place her in front of many aggressive inquisitors. Her campaign, like that of former President Donald J. Trump, believes that the traditional strategy of interviews with broadcast networks and national newspapers is outdated and not worth the accompanying risks, because swing voters tend to get their political news from less traditional sources.</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-takeaways.html" title="">Ms. Harris’s first cable television sit-down</a> was with Stephanie Ruhle of MSNBC, a friendly face who days earlier had expressed her preference for Ms. Harris over Mr. Trump.</p><p>Likewise, many of those interviewing Ms. Harris this week have openly backed either her or Mr. Biden.</p><p>Mr. Colbert hosted fund-raisers for Mr. Biden in 2020 and again this year. Mr. Stern endorsed Mr. Biden in 2020 and hosted him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/us/politics/biden-howard-stern-trump.html" title="">for a warm interview in April</a>.</p><p>Mr. Walz will appear on Tuesday on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Mr. Kimmel last month endorsed Ms. Harris for president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s campaign had already announced that she and Mr. Walz would appear in an interview with the CBS News program “60 Minutes” that is set to air on Monday night. The campaign had also said that Ms. Harris would participate on Thursday in a Univision town-hall event in Las Vegas.</p><p>The vice president has also recorded an interview on Call Her Daddy, a popular podcast about sex, dating and relationships. The interview, which focuses on abortion rights and other women’s issues, is set to be released on Sunday evening.</p><p>Both Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz will campaign on Wednesday in Arizona on the first day of the state’s early voting period. Ms. Harris will return to Arizona for an event on Friday.</p><p>At each of her stops, Ms. Harris is expected to urge supporters to return their ballots without delay, an exhortation she made on Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/kamala-harris-trump-gas-cars-evs-michigan.html" title="">during a rally in Flint, Mich</a>.</p><p>“If you have received your ballot, please do not wait,” Ms. Harris said. “Fill it out and return it today.” She added, “Folks, the election is here.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
