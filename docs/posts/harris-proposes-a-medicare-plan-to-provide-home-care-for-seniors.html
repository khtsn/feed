    <h1>Harris Proposes a Medicare Plan to Provide Home Care for Seniors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most people have no choice but to rely on a family member to care for them because they cannot afford the cost of care, which can surpass the expense of an assisted living facility. Agencies can charge <a href="https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about $30 an hour</a>, according to Genworth, a long-term care insurance company. Others end up spending most of their assets and seeking care in a nursing home, where Medicaid does not have waiting lists.</p><p>Judy Feder, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, who <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Public-Catastrophic-Insurance-Paper-for-Bipartisan-Policy-Center-1-25-2018.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a recent paper</a> on a possible Medicare home-care benefit, said such a policy would fill a major gap in Medicare, and relieve financial and physical burdens on family members. The private market for long-term care insurance has not functioned well, she said: “It’s a catastrophic, unpredictable event for which you need insurance.”</p><p>The Biden administration wanted to offer more help, including for home health care, as part of its big domestic policy bill, but the effort was axed from the bill during congressional negotiations. That approach, estimated to cost $150 billion over a decade, was more modest. It would have provided additional funding to state Medicaid programs to reduce waiting lists for home care.</p><p>The Harris proposal would be much broader because it would not be limited to Americans enrolled in Medicaid, who must be poor to qualify.</p><p>A Medicare benefit would be more universal, though that does not mean it would be free to everyone who uses it. A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-home-care-benefit-for-medicare/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent paper from the Brookings Institution</a> sketched out some possible design considerations, including requiring higher cost sharing for families with more wealth and restrictions on paying family members to provide the care. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-home-care-benefit-for-medicare/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Brookings plan</a>, which would provide a benefit targeted at lower-middle-class Americans, was estimated to cost around $40 billion a year.</p></div></div>
