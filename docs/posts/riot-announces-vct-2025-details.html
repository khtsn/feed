		<p>Riot has <a href="https://twitter.com/VALORANT/status/1826095631125168211" target="_blank">unveiled details</a> on the 2025 Valorant Champions Tour calendar and changes to the overall circuit. The revamped system includes new formats, an expanded calendar spanning from January to October, and will implement the new <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/363225/riot-reveals-challengers-and-ascension-changes-for-2025" target="_blank">Ascension changes</a>. Additionally, Riot has revealed the next locations for Masters and Champions, as well as announced plans for new in-game cosmetics based on the VCT.</p>

<p>In 2025, Bangkok and Toronto will each host a Masters event, while Champions will take place in Paris. Riot also confirmed Champions will be held in China for 2026 and the Americas for 2027.</p>

<p><img src="https://owcdn.net/img/66c594bc2dbb1.jpg" alt="VCT 2025 calendar"/>
<em>VCT 2025 will run from January through October with a reworked format</em></p>

<p>The 2025 season will begin in January with Kickoff. The new year brings a new format, as each region will seed their 12 teams directly into a double-elimination bracket, forgoing the group stage and play-in stage from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/295579/vct-kickoff-format-and-points-distribution-revealed" target="_blank">2024</a>. The top two teams from each tournament will qualify to Masters Bangkok. </p>

<p>For the regular season, Stage playoffs will expand to eight teams, compared to the six from 2024. In Stage 1, the top three teams from each region will qualify to Masters Toronto, for a total of 12 teams. Unlike this year, Stage 1 results will not affect the Stage 2 standings. Eight teams will advance to the playoffs, with the top teams qualifying directly to Champions 2025. </p>

<p>The final Champions slots from each region will be determined based on championship points, which have been reworked for 2025. Riot will confirm further details on their points system at a later date. </p>

<p>Finally, Riot will update the Classic skins for team bundles, as well as release a new capsule similar to the LOCK//IN skins from 2023. </p>

			<p>W Toronto. But why tf is kickoff still a thing. 8 teams is criminal for an international tournament, especially when we only have 3 major tournaments a year. </p>
<p>Also two teams make champs by winning in split 2??? I think I liked 3 teams making it through points better. That favors consistency over a good run. </p>
<p>Shorter off-season hella nice tho </p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4022171">
		
		
		<div>
			
			<p>only 1 team made it through points in 2024.</p>
<p>Kickoff is a thing because its optimal to having a masters without an overlly long time of qualification. The masters being 8 teams is also to make the event shorter. </p>		</div>

			<p>Thanks for the correction on points, forgot about that.</p>
<p>I understand your point about about masters being shorter, but I still really don&#39;t like that. I would rather there be a full split to start the year and full 12 team tournament. Wasting one of three majors we get a year is a horrible decision.</p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4022705">
		
		
		<p>Think it boils down to money. Riot doesn&#39;t wanna do more than they&#39;re already doing. Viewership tanked in League of Legends and so they&#39;re probably afraid it&#39;ll eventually happen to Valorant too.</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4022727">
		
		
		<p>riot also kinda cant, throughout the entire year there is something riot related, they literally dont have extra time in a year</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div></div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4022722">
		
		
		<p>Problem with that is, your the need to miss a qualification for another event, and then cram all the work to compensate for the longer masters or you stream multiple games at the same time.</p>

		<p>Agreed. I think then I would prefer something like lcq for champs instead of the split two. But that comes with it&#39;s own issues</p>

		<p>The regional knifes from Lock IN were really good, hopefully they make something similar like that. And it&#39;s a good thing that the bundles get a fresh design too</p>
