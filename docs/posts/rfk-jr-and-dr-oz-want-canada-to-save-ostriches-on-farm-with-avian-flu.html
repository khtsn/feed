The birds were in contact with a deadly virus: H5N1, a type of avian flu.</p><p>Canada ordered the birds to be culled after the avian virus spread through Universal Ostrich Farms in Edgewood, British Columbia, a town in the province’s interior, north of Washington State.</p><p>The plight of the wobble — a term sometimes used to describe a group of ostriches — has divided Canadians, but the birds have won allies across the border, namely top officials in the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy last week urged the Canadian authorities not to kill the ostriches but to do further testing to try to better understand the virus.</p><p>“We believe significant scientific knowledge may be garnered from following the ostriches in a controlled environment,” Mr. Kennedy said in a letter to the head of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which ordered the culling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert F.

But testing revealed it was the H5N1 virus, and just over a month later, 69 of the 468 ostriches on the farm had died.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Tests by officials from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed a few of the birds had died of the same virus.</p><p>The agency ordered the farm’s owners, Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski, to eradicate the surviving birds, but they argued that the animals should be kept alive to test their antibodies in order to potentially develop treatments for the virus.</p><p>The couple lost a legal battle in federal court to keep the birds alive.</p><p>“When they issue an order to euthanize all of our healthy ostriches,” it “crossed the total moral line,” Katie Pasitney, Ms. Espersen’s daughter, said in an interview.</p><p>Shayan Sharif, a professor of immunology at the Ontario Veterinary College who specializes in avian viruses, said, however, that the condemned ostriches were of limited scientific value because there had already been similar studies in other parts of the world.</p><p>Still, he added, “I know that those animals are near and dear to a lot of people, especially their owners.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Pasitney, 43, grew up on the 65-acre farm, which has been raising ostriches for 30 years, at first for meat and oil derived from the bird’s liver. More recently, she said, the farm has switched its focus to research, partnering with scientists to study the birds and their immune systems.</p><p>Despite the potential presence of the virus, protesters have descended on the farm, which is under quarantine, holding news conferences and filming visits by food safety inspectors dressed in white coveralls and masks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Mehmet Oz, who oversees Medicare and Medicaid, has offered to relocate the doomed birds to his 900-acre Florida ranch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Canadian officials have said that they will not announce a date for the cull, which will be contracted out to a team that will use carbon dioxide gas to euthanize the ostriches, Ms. Pasitney said. The food inspection agency did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>People opposed to the cull are using walkie-talkies to surveil the road leading to the farm for any signs of “a dumpster and a convoy of vehicles coming out here to kill our healthy animals,” Ms. Pasitney said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Pasitney said she was moved by the support of Trump officials, and by a special guest who visited the farm, a 13-year-old girl.
