Plumes of thick, acrid smoke rose above the city skyline after a wave of missiles shook the area, sending schoolchildren running for cover miles from the blasts as Israeli surveillance drones buzzed overhead.</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli military said that it had conducted “intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah terrorist targets” in the Dahiya area. “The targets include command centers, weapons production sites and additional Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure.”</p><p>The Lebanese authorities said they were assessing the extent of casualties and damage from the Dahiya strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After the strikes, the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 14 towns and villages in southern Lebanon, the second wave of such alerts in 48 hours after nearly a month without them. Some of the towns had already been emptied and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-border-photos-video.html" title="">largely leveled</a> by Israel’s ground offensive, which began last month.</p><p>Israel’s military said on Tuesday that it had struck about 100 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon over the past day. Elsewhere in Lebanon, at least 23 people were killed in Israeli strikes, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Strikes from Lebanon killed two people in northern Israel on Tuesday, the Israeli authorities said.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces said in the statement that Hezbollah “systematically embeds its terrorist infrastructure into the heart of civilian areas,” calling it “a further example of Hezbollah’s cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians as human shields.”</p><p>Hezbollah has been attacking northern Israel nearly every day since last October, when the Iran-backed militant group launched cross-border assaults in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza.</p><p>During that time, it has fired more than 14,000 rockets toward Israel, according to the Israeli military, but Israel’s air-defense system has intercepted most of them. Still, the threat has forced a broad evacuation of Israel’s north.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Monday, the attacks continued, with Hezbollah firing 200 projectiles into Israel, according to Israel’s military. On Monday night, Israel launched one of its farthest strikes into northern Lebanon since the war began, killing eight people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.</p><p>The flurry of strikes amounts to an escalation from both sides. And the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah this week has been larger than usual. The deepening of the conflict comes despite what appeared to be growing efforts at a diplomatic settlement. Since the confrontation began last year, Lebanese and United Nations officials say, 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than a fifth of the population has been displaced.</p><p>Last week, a senior Israeli official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html" title="">visited Russia</a> to gauge if the country could assist in enforcing a truce in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, repeated calls for a cease-fire in a meeting with Egypt’s president. And on Monday, Israel’s new foreign minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/middleeast/gideon-saar-israel-foreign-minister.html" title="">Gideon Saar</a>, said that the United States had renewed efforts to broker talks, adding, “There is progress.”</p><p>But that stance was soon contradicted by his predecessor, Israel Katz, who was named defense minister last week. In <a href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1856219485469839367" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an online post</a> on Tuesday, Mr. Katz said he had met with Israeli generals and told them to continue the offensive against Hezbollah.</p><p>“In Lebanon, there will be no cease-fire and there will be no respite,” he wrote. “We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved. Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel’s right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/12/multimedia/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/12/multimedia/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/12/multimedia/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A person stands on debris from a building near green hills." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/12/multimedia/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/12/multimedia/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/12/multimedia/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/12/multimedia/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw/12mideast-crisis-lebanon-kjpw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d717ce22-a267-5c98-8a6c-44449956e2f6" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destruction in the Lebanese town of Almat, north of Beirut, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Here’s what else is happening:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gaza aid deadline: </strong>The U.S. deadline for Israel to increase the flow of aid to Gaza expires this week.

The United Nations has said that Israel has continued to restrict many aid shipments into Gaza, including nearly all aid into the north Gaza region, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-north-gaza-hamas-war.html" title="">under an intense siege</a> since October.</p><p>Israeli officials said on Tuesday that the Kissufim crossing into Gaza had been opened in an effort to increase the flow of aid.
