Plumes of thick, acrid smoke rose above the city skyline after a wave of missiles shook the area, sending schoolchildren running for cover miles from the blasts as Israeli surveillance drones buzzed overhead.</p><p>The Lebanese authorities said they were assessing the extent of casualties and damage from the Dahiya strikes.</p><p>Hours later, the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 14 towns and villages in southern Lebanon, the second wave of such alerts in 48 hours after nearly a month without them. Some of the towns had already been emptied and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-border-photos-video.html" title="">largely leveled</a> by Israel’s ground offensive, which began last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel’s military said on Tuesday that it had struck about 100 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon over the past day. The claim could not be independently verified. Elsewhere in Lebanon, at least 11 people were killed and six others wounded in Israeli strikes, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.</p><p>Hezbollah has been attacking northern Israel nearly every day since the latest confrontation between the adversaries began last October, when the Iran-backed militant group launched cross-border assaults in support of Hamas in Gaza.</p><p>In that time, it has fired more than 14,000 rockets toward Israel, according to the Israeli military, but Israel’s vaunted air-defense system has intercepted most of them. Still, the threat has forced a broad evacuation of Israel’s north. Hezbollah fired 200 projectiles into Israel on Monday, according to Israel’s military.</p><p>The flurry of strikes amounts to an escalation from both sides. The exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah this week has been larger than usual. And on Monday night, Israel launched one of its farthest strikes into northern Lebanon since the war began, killing eight people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.</p><p>The deepening of the conflict comes despite what appeared to be growing efforts at a diplomatic settlement. Since the confrontation began last year, Lebanese and United Nations officials say, 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than a fifth of the population has been displaced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last week, a senior Israeli official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html" title="">visited Russia</a> to gauge if the country could assist in enforcing a truce in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, repeated calls for a cease-fire in a meeting with Egypt’s president. And on Monday, Israel’s new foreign minister, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/middleeast/gideon-saar-israel-foreign-minister.html" title="">Gideon Saar</a>, said that the United States had renewed efforts to broker talks, adding, “There is progress.”</p><p>But that stance was soon contradicted by his predecessor, Israel Katz, who was named defense minister last week. In <a href="https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1856219485469839367" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an online post</a> early Tuesday, Mr. Katz said he had met with Israeli generals and told them to continue the offensive against Hezbollah.</p><p>“In Lebanon, there will be no cease-fire and there will be no respite,” he wrote. “We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved. Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel’s right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own.”</p><p>Mr. Mikati’s embattled Lebanese government has been pushing to fully put in place a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/middleeast/un-resolution-1701-explained.html" title="">U.N. resolution that ended the last major war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006</a>. The agreement, though widely considered a resounding failure in the years since, is today viewed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/us-diplomacy-israel-lebanon.html" title="">Lebanese and U.S. officials</a> as a potential road map for peace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destruction in the Lebanese town of Almat, north of Beirut, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Here’s what else is happening:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gaza aid deadline: </strong>The U.S. deadline for Israel to increase the flow of aid to Gaza expires this week. On Oct. 13, U.S. officials gave Israel 30 days to increase relief deliveries to the territory, suggesting it could risk losing some U.S. support. The United Nations has said that Israel has continued to restrict many aid shipments into Gaza, including nearly all aid into the north Gaza region, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-north-gaza-hamas-war.html" title="">under an intense siege</a> since October.</p><p>Israeli officials said on Tuesday that the Kissufim crossing into Gaza had been opened in an effort to increase the flow of aid. The crossing, which connects the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis to Israel, had been closed since 2005.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Nicas is a foreign correspondent for The Times, covering the conflict in the Middle East from Jerusalem.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-nicas">More about Jack Nicas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
