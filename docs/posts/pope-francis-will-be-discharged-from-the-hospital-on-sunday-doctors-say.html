He used noninvasive mechanical ventilation during the night, alternating with high-flow oxygen therapy during the day.</p><p>On March 10, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis had improved enough to no longer be considered in imminent danger from pneumonia and other infections, but said he would require more days of in patient treatment.
