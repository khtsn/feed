Truman has been lost in the Red Sea.</p><p>The jet was landing on the flight deck of the Truman on Tuesday when the aircraft’s arrestment system, which helps the aircraft stop on the runway, failed, “causing the aircraft to go overboard,” according to the United States Central Command.</p><p>The two pilots aboard the plane, an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet <a href="https://www.blueangels.navy.mil/assets/docs/resources/faq.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worth at least $67 million</a>, ejected and sustained minor injuries. They were rescued by a helicopter and no one else was injured.</p><p>The accident came about a week after another F/A-18 Super Hornet and a tow tractor fell off the Truman when the crew lost control of the plane, the Navy said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/middleeast/us-navy-fighter-jet-houthis-red-sea.html" title="">That mishap occurred</a> when the aircraft carrier was maneuvering to better position itself against the threat of Houthi missiles and drones, according to Defense Department officials with knowledge of the incident.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For more than a year, the Houthis have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">firing projectiles and launching drones</a> at commercial and military ships in the Red Sea, in what the militia group has described as a show of solidarity with Gaza residents and Hamas.</p><p>On Tuesday, the United States and the Houthis in Yemen reached <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/us/politics/trump-houthis-bombing.html" title="">a deal to halt American airstrikes</a> against the group after it agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea.</p><p>“They have capitulated, but more importantly, we will take their word,” President Trump said. “They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore.”</p><p>The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, <a href="https://x.com/SeanParnellATSD/status/1919935706027241478" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that the loss of the fighter jet on Tuesday was under investigation and that “the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group remains fully mission-capable.”</p><p>“We can confirm that this aircraft was not struck by the Houthis,” he said.</p><p>On March 15, Mr. Trump ordered the U.S. military to begin an air campaign, called Operation Rough Rider, against the Houthis, following some strikes under the Biden administration. The campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/military-targets-houthis-yemen.html" title="">has cost well over $1 billion</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>American forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/military-targets-houthis-yemen.html" title="">have hit more than 800 targets</a> in Yemen during the campaign, according to the U.S. military.</p><p>In addition to the two lost planes, there have been several other major accidents involving the Truman since it deployed to the Middle East in September.</p><p>In February, the carrier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/middleeast/us-navy-carrier-commercial-ship-collision.html" title="">collided with a merchant ship</a> near Port Said, Egypt, damaging both vessels. And in December, an F/A-18 Super Hornet flying from the aircraft carrier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/us/us-fighter-jet-red-sea.html" title="">was shot down by the U.S.S. Gettysburg</a>, a guided-missile cruiser that was accompanying the Truman. The two pilots aboard the plane were safely recovered.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
