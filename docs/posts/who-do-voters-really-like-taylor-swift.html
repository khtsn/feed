    <h1>Who Do Voters Really Like? Taylor Swift.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ms. Swift posted her endorsement <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Instagram</a>, writing that she was supporting Ms. Harris “because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”</p><p>The Times has never polled voters about Ms. Swift before, but it appears that her decision has quickly divided Americans along partisan lines.<span>  </span>Among Democrats, 70 percent view her favorably, compared with 23 percent of Republicans.</p><p>Among those with an unfavorable view, of course, is former President Donald J. Trump, who, over the weekend, wrote in a post on Truth Social: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”</p><p>It’s worth wondering whether a well-selected lyric — say, “And it would’ve been sweet, if it could’ve been me” — from Trump might have elicited at least some sympathy from Swifties, who, through her songs, are intimately familiar with heartbreak and rejection.</p><p>According to the Times/Inquirer/Siena poll, 47 percent of voters view Mr. Trump favorably, while 51 percent view him unfavorably. Ms. Harris is viewed favorably by 48 percent of voters and unfavorably by 49 percent.</p></div></div>
