</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>P.B.M. executives deny that they are underpaying small pharmacies. And they say they are not to blame for drugstore closings, which they attribute to other factors like changing consumer habits and high labor costs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>To some extent, the P.B.M.s are simply doing their jobs, the most important of which is to reduce drug costs for their clients. It is those clients’ money that P.B.M.s use to pay pharmacies. In theory, the less P.B.M.s pay small drugstores, the more they save for employers and governments. That, in turn, can lower insurance premiums for workers and people covered by government programs like Medicare.</p><p>“There is an inherent tension between the interests of retail pharmacies and the employers, unions and other entities that offer prescription drug benefits,” said Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts.</p><p>David Joyner, the president of Caremark who this past week was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/business/cvs-ceo-karen-lynch.html" title="">promoted</a> to be chief executive of CVS, said the benefit manager’s priority was to save money for employers, not to keep independent drugstores afloat by paying them more than necessary.</p><p>“I think today you would argue that there are more pharmacies than we probably need,” he said.</p><p>But that apparent frugality often benefits the P.B.M.s in ways that have nothing to do with their clients’ interests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The benefit managers have a variety of methods to extract profits, such as charging fees to clients. But there are quieter ways, too. At the same time that P.B.M.s are reimbursing pharmacies at rates below their costs, the benefit managers are often charging employers much higher prices and pocketing the difference, according to insurance paperwork reviewed by The Times.</p><p>Another source of profits is the P.B.M.s’ own pharmacies. Caremark’s owner, CVS, operates the country’s largest chain of retail drugstores. And the parent companies of all three big P.B.M.s — Express Scripts is part of Cigna, and Optum Rx is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group — also own warehouse-based pharmacies that send prescriptions to patients through the mail.</p><p>The P.B.M.s have been poaching customers from rival pharmacies. For example, they push and in some cases require patients to stop filling certain prescriptions at local drugstores and to instead fill them via the benefit managers’ mail-order pharmacies. That tactic has hastened the demise of some local drugstores, according to pharmacy owners.</p><p>In Confluence, Pam Miller, 68, gets her insurance through Medicare and has Express Scripts as her P.B.M. Since Mr. Jacobs’s pharmacy closed, she has started using Express Scripts’ mail-order service to fill her seven regular prescriptions.</p><p>For each of those medications, Express Scripts has been paying itself more than it was paying Yough Valley Pharmacy, according to her insurance paperwork. In the case of one drug, nortriptyline, Express Scripts had been paying Yough Valley Pharmacy about $9 for a three-month supply. When Ms. Miller switched to Express Scripts’ mail-order pharmacy, the P.B.M. paid itself more than $26.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/09/multimedia/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/09/multimedia/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/09/multimedia/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A row of houses along a road lined with utility poles." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/09/multimedia/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/09/multimedia/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/09/multimedia/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/09/multimedia/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk/00pharmacies-pbms-06-jgfk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>For residents of Confluence, Pa., the nearest pharmacy is now 14 miles away.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Sessions said Express Scripts sets its payment rates based on several factors, including changes in how much it costs pharmacies to buy drugs.</p><p>The evidence that P.B.M.s pay their own pharmacies more than independent drugstores for the same medications is not just anecdotal. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c326d5596e76f58ee234632/t/667a03dc16a9fb18a1b13614/1719272422304/3AA_Washington_Report_20240620.pdf#page=5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One study</a>, paid for by a pharmacy association, found that the markup that P.B.M.s were charging on brand-name drugs was 35 times higher when the drugs were sold through their own mail-order pharmacies than when the drugs were sold by independent drugstores.</p><p><a href="https://www.medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jun23_MedPAC_Report_To_Congress_SEC.pdf#page=124" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government</a> <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/pharmacy-benefit-managers-staff-report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a> have identified a similar phenomenon.</p><p>Those extra costs are borne by taxpayers or employers and can be passed on to patients in the form of higher premiums — at odds with the benefit managers’ mandate of lowering drug costs.</p><p>P.B.M. officials said that the studies were based on cherry-picked examples and that they often paid independent pharmacies more than they paid themselves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Independent pharmacies gain public sympathy when they spotlight instances when a specific drug is dispensed without much profit, while concealing other instances when a different drug is dispensed with a substantial profit,” said David Whitrap, a spokesman for CVS Caremark.

Vice President Kamala Harris has promised that as president she would <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf#page=26" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crack down</a> on “abusive practices by pharmaceutical middlemen who squeeze small pharmacies’ profits.”</p><p>A recent Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/pharmacy-benefit-managers-staff-report.pdf#page=44" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> quoted from an internal document that investigators obtained from one of the P.B.M. conglomerates. In the document, an executive at the company, which the F.T.C. report did not name, wrote to colleagues that “we’ve created plan designs to aggressively steer customers to home delivery where the drug cost is ~200 times higher.” Separately, the F.T.C. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/health/ftc-drug-price-inflation-insulin.html" title="">recently sued</a> the largest P.B.M.s, accusing them of improperly inflating insulin prices.

Rents are increasing. So are labor costs. People have grown more comfortable getting everything from laundry detergent to medications delivered through the mail, sapping pharmacies of long-running revenue streams. And independent drugstores don’t enjoy the economies of scale that allow larger chains to save money on things like software systems and drugs. (Even CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/business/walgreens-store-closures-earnings.html" title="">have been closing</a> hundreds of stores.)</p><p>In some cases, P.B.M. officials said, they pay rural pharmacies higher rates than they pay those in more densely populated areas. “We have been working to ensure pharmacies are paid fairly,” said Elizabeth Hoff, a spokeswoman for Optum Rx.</p><p>Yet the top P.B.M.s — which have come to dominate the prescription drug market only over the past decade — are in many cases dealing decisive blows.</p><p>The benefit managers decide which pharmacies are available to patients through their insurance.

Because the top P.B.M.s collectively control the overwhelming majority of prescriptions, pharmacies that forfeit their business could not survive.</p><p>But agreeing to those contracts can also spell trouble, according to pharmacists nationwide.

She lives on the outskirts of town on a desolate road with few neighbors. She often called Ms. Ralston with questions. Every three months, an employee would meet Ms. Rugg, who uses a walker, in the parking lot and load her medications into her car so she wouldn’t have to go inside. When she learned the pharmacy was closing, she cried. She now gets her medications delivered.</p><p>The nearest pharmacy is now 14 miles away in Farmington, Pa. The pharmacist there estimated that 20 to 30 patients had skipped their medications for at least a week by the time they came to him after Yough Valley Pharmacy closed.</p><p>Compared with some other communities, Confluence has been lucky. Mainline Pharmacy, another independent drugstore about 25 miles away, is delivering prescriptions to many people’s homes. But Mainline, too, is struggling with low P.B.M. reimbursements, and it closed nine of its 11 stores in March.</p><p>The Confluence grocery store has repurposed the space that Mr. Jacobs’s pharmacy once occupied. Now there is a row of casino-style machines. The shelves that held pill bottles contain packs of cigarettes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-41"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The grocery store that housed Confluence’s only pharmacy, shown in February, has found other uses for its space. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><p>Susan C.
