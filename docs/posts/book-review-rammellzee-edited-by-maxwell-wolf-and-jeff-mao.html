In the ’80s he began experimenting with new materials and a more formal studio practice, producing large-scale paintings, frescoes, sculpture, music, performance art and the elaborate costumes he wore to embody otherworldly, gender-fluid characters, like “Chaser the Eraser” and “Shun-U.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Tower of Panzerism, The S.S.

He had an on-and-off friendship with Jean-Michel Basquiat, who helped produce his 1983 vinyl single “Beat Bop,” and he had a small part in the 1984 film “Stranger Than Paradise,” whose director, Jim Jarmusch, called him an overlooked genius.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rammellzee in his apartment in New York City’s TriBeCa neighborhood, c. 1991.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Monica Fritz
