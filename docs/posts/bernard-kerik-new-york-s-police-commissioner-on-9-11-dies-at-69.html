Kerik, the New York City police commissioner who was hailed as a hero for overseeing the department’s response to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, only to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/nyregion/10man.html" title="">fall from grace</a> after he pleaded guilty to federal corruption and tax crimes, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 69.</p><p>Kash Patel, the director of the F.B.I., announced Mr. Kerik’s death in a post on X. He said the former commissioner died “after a private battle with illness.”</p><p>A cocksure high school dropout with a black belt in karate, shaved head and bulging biceps, Mr. Kerik vaulted to senior public posts as a disciple of Rudolph W. Giuliani after serving as Mr. Giuliani’s bodyguard during his successful 1993 mayoral campaign.</p><p>In 1997, after Mr. Kerik had risen through the ranks of the Police Department from a street cop in Times Square and narcotics investigator, Mr. Giuliani promoted him to correction commissioner. In that position, he curbed sick-time abuse by prison guards and reduced violence by inmates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Kerik’s appointment as police commissioner in August 2000 was not well received, in part because he had been so rapidly promoted despite his lack of a college degree, which uniformed police officers ordinarily needed for promotion to captain and above. His highest rank before becoming commissioner was detective third grade. He later went on to earn a degree in 2002.</p><p>During his 16-month tenure as police commissioner, crime continued the decline that had been largely achieved by two of his predecessors, Raymond W. Kelly and William J. Bratton. Morale among officers improved. So did relations between the department and Black and Hispanic New Yorkers who had been alienated by incidents of police abuse.</p><p>But Mr. Kerik was accused of heavy-handed management and abuse of power as commissioner until Dec. 31, 2001, when Mr. Giuliani’s mayoral term ended.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kerik, right, who was then New York’s police commissioner, with the city’s mayor at the time, Rudolph W.

He and Mr. Giuliani rushed to the site to speed the evacuation of the World Trade Center. They were showered by debris from the collapse of the towers and were temporarily trapped in a nearby building.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Among the honors bestowed on Mr. Kerik was his appointment as a Commander of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>After leaving the Police Department, Mr. Kerik made millions of dollars as a security consultant for the former mayor’s firm, Giuliani Partners, whose clients included companies and foreign governments seeking advice on crisis management and counterterrorism.</p><p>Mr. Kerik later established his own consulting firm, which advised King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Bharrat Jagdeo of Guyana and the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates, among others. More recently, he was a security consultant to the monarchy in Qatar.</p><p>After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush appointed Mr. Kerik interior minister for that nation’s provisional authority. He recruited thousands of police officers and assembled a SWAT team to pursue kidnappers and insurgents.</p><p>But his career was soon derailed by a series of embarrassing public setbacks.</p><p>In 2004, he was named by the president to head the Department of Homeland Security. But he withdrew one week later because, he said, he had employed an undocumented immigrant as a babysitter and neglected to pay payroll taxes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That admission triggered several investigations.</p><p>It was revealed that while he was married with two children and living in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, he had rented an apartment in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan to conduct an extramarital affair with Judith Regan, who had published his best-selling memoir. The apartment had originally been donated by a developer for use by rescue workers at the World Trade Center site.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kerik after being nominated to run the Homeland Security Department by President George W.

He was fined $221,000.</p><p>In 2007, he was accused of tax fraud. The federal indictment was based, in part, on information provided by his former friend, Larry Ray, who was later accused of operating a sex cult at Sarah Lawrence College in Westchester.</p><p>Mr. Kerik was charged with making false statements to government investigators involving his failure to report a $250,000 interest-free loan from Eitan Wertheimer, an Israeli billionaire, while he was serving the Iraqi provisional government, and $236,000 that he had received earlier from Steven C. Witkoff, a New York real estate magnate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2009, he pleaded guilty to two counts of tax fraud, one count of making a false statement on a loan application and five counts of making false statements to the federal government while being vetted for senior positions. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/nyregion/19kerik.html" title="">He was sentenced</a> to four years in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/nyregion/18kerik.html" title="">prison</a> and served three.</p><p>His name was stripped from the Manhattan jail complex, better known as the Tombs, that had been rebranded in his honor.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/nyregion/bernie-kerik-pardon.html" title="">2020,</a> after Mr. Kerik was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/nyregion/bernard-kerik-pardon.html" title="">granted a full pardon</a> by President Trump, he joined Mr. Giuliani in falsely blaming fraudulent voting for the president’s loss to Joseph R. Biden Jr. in that year’s election. </p><p>In 2021, he submitted documents to the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that incriminated him in other efforts to overturn Mr. Biden’s election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Kerik remained a staunch Trump supporter. Just last month, he complained in The Washington Times about “the repeated attempts of President Trump’s political enemies to use the law and the agencies ostensibly in charge of enforcing it to attack and silence him.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kerik, a staunch supporter of President Trump, appeared at a trial for Mr. Trump in 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Bernard Bailey Kerik was born on Sept. 4, 1955, in Newark, the son of Donald Kerik Sr., a Ford Motor Company machinist. His paternal grandfather had migrated to Pennsylvania from Ukraine, became a coal miner and changed the family name from Kapurik.</p><p>His mother, Patricia Joann (Bailey) Kerik, was Irish American. In his memoir, he described her as a prostitute who abandoned him when he was 3 and was mysteriously murdered, probably by her pimp, six years later.</p><p>Mr. Kerik was raised in Paterson, N.J. He attended Eastside High School but dropped out in 1972. In 1974, he enlisted in the Army and served in the military police in South Korea. While stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, he received a General Educational Development certificate; in 2002, after leaving the Police Department, he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in social theory by Empire State College of the State University of New York.</p><p>Beginning in December 1981, he worked for the Passaic County sheriff in New Jersey. He was a chief investigator for a hospital in Saudi Arabia from 1982 to 1984, but he was fired after directing the security staff to surveil women with whom the hospital administrator was romantically involved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He joined the New York Police Department in 1986 and earned dozens of medals as he rose through the ranks. In 1994, he went to work for the Department of Correction. Four years later, Mr. Giuliani named him commissioner, a job he held until he returned to the Police Department.</p><p>He was the author of a memoir, “The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice” (2001), and “From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey From Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate 84888-054” (2015). He also wrote a crime novel, “The Grave Above the Grave” (2018).</p><p>Mr. Kerik was married three times after having a daughter with a woman in South Korea in 1975 while he was serving in the Army. He abandoned the two of them when his tour of duty ended. Decades later, the mother learned of his whereabouts when she saw him on television.</p><p>In his memoir, he lamented that his behavior was “a mistake I will always regret, and I pray to God that one day I can make it right.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kerik at the 2024 Charlie Daniels Patriot Awards in Nashville.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jason Kempin/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>His first marriage, to Linda Hales in 1978, ended in divorce in 1983. He had a son, Joseph, with his second wife, Jacqueline Llerena; their marriage lasted from 1983 to 1992. In 1998, he married Hala Matli. The couple had two daughters, Celine and Angelina, and lived in Franklin Lakes, N.J. His wife, son and daughters survive him.</p><p>Mr. Kerik, who had a radio show on WABC after serving with the city, was a fervent booster of both the Bush and Trump administrations.</p><p>“With the exception of the birth of my children, today is one of the greatest days of my life,” Mr. Kerik said when Mr. Trump granted him a pardon in 2020.</p><p>Trying to place his roller-coaster career in context, Mr. Kerik told New York magazine in 2005: “I made some major mistakes, and they catch up to you. I didn’t focus enough on ethical issues. But I still believe that my successes over my 30-year career outweigh the errors in judgment.”</p><p>Francesca Regalado<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sam Roberts is an obituaries reporter for The Times, writing mini-biographies about the lives of remarkable people.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
