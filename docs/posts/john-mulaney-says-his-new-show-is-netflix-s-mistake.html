</div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The comedian reminded viewers that he’d had an earlier show with a similar concept: a six-episode live series called “Everybody’s in L.A.” that ended last May. While fans enjoyed its unpredictability, the show’s name was a turnoff in Netflix screen tests, he said: “It turns out that people around the country don’t like L.A.”</p><blockquote><p>“After the fires, I said, ‘Maybe they like us more now,’ so we tested it again, and it turns out, no. People still didn’t.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p><p>“Netflix actually picked up this show by accident. They thought that it was a true-crime documentary because I look like a disappeared boy.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mulaney also referred to his much-scrutinized personal life with his wife, the actress Olivia Munn, and their two young children before moving on to the night’s guests.</p><blockquote><p>“Yes, I have two children now. One was controversial; one you all seem to be cool with, so thank you so much for that.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-cc9eea4">The Punchiest Punchlines (Bad Education Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump just announced he’s firing 50 percent of the Department of Education.
