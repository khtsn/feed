(Again)</h2><p>Netflix launched its new late-night show, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/arts/television/john-mulaney-everybodys-live-netflix.html" title="">“Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney,”</a> on Wednesday. In his monologue, Mulaney promised 12 episodes of a “jazzlike, unpredictable talk show.”</p><blockquote><p>“I’m not gonna lie — we’ve been working on this episode all day. Some crew got here as early as 9 a.m.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p><p>“I can’t do coke or Adderall anymore, so I’m making it your problem. Will this show get my heart rate up to the level where I feel alive? We shall see.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The comedian reminded viewers that he’d had an earlier show with a similar concept: a six-episode live series called “Everybody’s in L.A.” that ended last May. While fans enjoyed its unpredictability, the show’s name was a turnoff in Netflix screen tests, he said: “It turns out that people around the country don’t like L.A.”</p><blockquote><p>“After the fires, I said, ‘Maybe they like us more now,’ so we tested it again, and it turns out, no. People still didn’t.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p><p>“Netflix actually picked up this show by accident. They thought that it was a true-crime documentary because I look like a disappeared boy.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mulaney also referred to his much-scrutinized personal life with his wife, the actress Olivia Munn, and their two young children before moving on to the night’s guests.</p><blockquote><p>“Yes, I have two children now. One was controversial; one you all seem to be cool with, so thank you so much for that.” <em>— JOHN MULANEY</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-cc9eea4">The Punchiest Punchlines (Bad Education Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump just announced he’s firing 50 percent of the Department of Education. Even worse, Trump said, ‘Don’t worry, the other 60 percent will still have jobs.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Trump, really, he’s Thanos-ed the Department of Education.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“The new secretary of education is Linda McMahon, who’s married to Vince McMahon of the W.W.E. Could you imagine getting fired by the wife of the disgraced wrestling meathead? Don’t let the folding chair hit you on the way out.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“Here’s a math problem. OK? If the Department of Education has 4,000 employees, and the president cuts 50 percent of the work force, how many edibles do I need to get through the next four years?” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“The Trump administration said 50 percent of the Department of Education staff will be eliminated, shocking the staff, who exclaimed, ‘Wow, that’s almost a third!’” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><blockquote><p>“We just learned that the Department of Education is being cut almost in half. Now, if they want to rob us, they’ll have to do it the old-fashioned way: pretending to meet us at a rest stop for sex and then stealing my wallet.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Jesse Eisenberg discussed producing the documentary “Secret Mall Apartment” on Wednesday’s “Tonight Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1a7073d0">What We’re Excited About on Thursday Night</h2><p>Natasha Rothwell, the returning star of “The White Lotus,” is set to appear on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>How we talk (or why we don’t) with the ones we love is a theme of Lucy Dacus’s new album.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Photo Illustration by The New York Times; Background: Brian Rea; Inset: Jerod Harris/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
