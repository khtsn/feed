You could see the rest of the traffic was allowed to go by. We were pulled over by soldiers and told that we were not allowed to proceed any farther. Much later in the afternoon, I was actually getting ready to catch a plane out of San Salvador back here later yesterday evening, and all of a sudden I got word that I would be allowed to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia. And they brought him to the hotel where I was staying. He spoke several times about your 5-year-old son who has autism. Five-year-old son, who was in the car in Maryland when Kilmar was pulled over by U.S. government agents and handcuffed. His 5-year-old son was in the car at that time. He told me that he was taken to Baltimore first. I assume that was the Baltimore detention center. He asked to make a phone call from there to let people know what had happened to him. But he was denied that opportunity.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/18/multimedia/18dc-vanhollen-thfc-copy/18dc-vanhollen-thfc-copy-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, shared details of his visit with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador last month.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Allison Bailey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robert-jimison"><img alt="Robert Jimison" title="Robert Jimison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robert-jimison" itemprop="name">Robert Jimison</a></p><div><p>Robert Jimison, who traveled to El Salvador to accompany Senator Chris Van Hollen, reported from Dulles International Airport.</p></div></div></div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-04-18T16:33:32-04:00"><span>April 18, 2025</span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Senator Chris Van Hollen said on Friday that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, reported having been traumatized inside a maximum-security prison in El Salvador before being transferred to another detention facility, where he remains in isolation.</p><p>The Maryland Democrat, who traveled to El Salvador to press for Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release and ended up meeting with him in San Salvador, said that Mr. Abrego Garcia had been transferred nine days ago from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, to a lower-level facility in Santa Ana.</p><p>“He said that the conditions were better at this new detention center, but he was still in a total blackout,” Mr. Van Hollen said in an interview before arriving back in Washington. “No news from the outside world. Can’t speak to anybody at all.”</p><p>At a news conference at Dulles International Airport after returning, Mr. Van Hollen said that Mr. Abrego Garcia had told him that during his nearly three weeks at the maximum-security prison, “he was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cell, but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>During their meeting Thursday evening, Mr. Abrego Garcia shared details with Mr. Van Hollen about his initial arrest and his time at CECOT, which El Salvador’s government says holds some of the most dangerous criminal gang members. </p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia described having been detained and taken to Baltimore, where he had asked to make a phone call but had been denied. He was then taken to a detention facility in Texas before being handcuffed and shackled, put on a plane with blacked-out windows with other deportees and eventually deposited at CECOT. </p><p>There, he was placed in a cell with around 25 other prisoners, according to Mr. Van Hollen.</p><p>“He said that he felt very sad to be in a place that’s meant for criminals,” Mr. Van Hollen said in the interview, referring to Mr. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who entered the United States illegally but was given a deportation reprieve in 2019. “That’s not who he is.”</p><p>The account came as a partisan battle over Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case continued to rage. President Trump and his team have portrayed the deported man as a dangerous gang member, and have ridiculed Democrats for objecting to his removal. The White House has insisted that Mr. Abrego Garcia will not be allowed back into the United States, despite a Supreme Court order that the Trump administration must facilitate his return. </p><p>Mr. Van Hollen and other Democrats have railed against the administration for depriving Mr. Abrego Garcia of due process and defying the court’s ruling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a social media post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Van Hollen, saying he “looked like a fool” for flying to Central America.</p><p>At the airport following his return, Mr. Van Hollen said that the administration’s efforts to demonize Mr. Abrego Garcia were an attempt to distract from its refusal to adhere to the rule of law, and from the principle that everyone living in the United States — even those who are not citizens or who are accused of crimes — should have constitutional rights.</p><p>“This case is not only about one man, as important as that is,” Mr. Van Hollen said. “It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the foundational principle of due process that the Constitution guarantees to everyone who resides in the United States.”</p><p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador indicated in a social media post acknowledging the meeting between Mr. Van Hollen and Mr. Abrego Garcia that his government would not heed the calls to return to the man to the United States. </p><p>After more than a month with no access to television, internet or media of any kind from beyond the walls and gates of the prison, Mr. Abrego Garcia had been heartened to learn of the attention his case had garnered in the United States, Mr. Van Hollen said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I told him that everyone from his family to his labor unions, to people through Maryland and in fact millions throughout the country were calling for him to have his full rights restored,” Mr. Van Hollen said. “He was clearly strengthened by the fact that people were fighting to ensure that his rights are protected.”</p><p>In the interview, the senator said that Mr. Abrego Garcia grew emotional when hearing about his wife, mother and children, and showed particular concern for his 5-year-old son, who has autism and was with him when he was detained.</p><p>“He immediately started welling up and tearing and crying — you could physically see the teardrops rolling down his cheek,” Mr. Van Hollen said. “And he said that what he was most worried about was how they were doing, which I found extraordinary given the fact he’d been illegally abducted, sent to CECOT and is still illegally detained.”</p><p>The Bukele administration’s brief release of Mr. Abrego Garcia for the meeting with Mr. Van Hollen was a remarkable about-face. </p><p>From the moment the senator arrived in El Salvador, Mr. Bukele’s lieutenants had blocked his requests to visit Mr. Abrego Garcia. Vice President Félix Ulloa rejected an in-person appeal from Mr. Van Hollen on Wednesday. The next day, a blockade manned by military personnel was erected in the middle of a road, to cut off the senator’s route to CECOT.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But Mr. Van Hollen’s persistence led to something of a breakthrough. Just hours after being stopped by the military, he got word that he would be allowed to see Mr. Abrego Garcia after all. The two met on the terrace of a luxury hotel in San Salvador.</p><p>Mr. Bukele’s decision to orchestrate the meeting appeared to be an attempt to appease growing concerns about the case without conceding ground. Mr. Van Hollen said the Salvadoran president’s team had deceptively stage-managed the encounter, at first suggesting that it take place beside the hotel’s swimming pool. Aides placed beverages that looked like cocktails in front of the two men, to be visible in photographs.</p><p>“Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ &amp; ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” Mr. Bukele wrote in a social media post, which included photos of the meeting.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Van Hollen said that neither he nor Mr. Abrego Garcia had touched the drinks.</p><p>“They want to create this appearance that life was just lovely for Kilmar, which of course is a big, fat lie,” he told reporters.</p><p>Mr. Abrego Garcia, who wore a collared shirt and baseball hat for the meeting, was returned to prison immediately afterward.</p><p>Chris Cameron<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, <!-- -->Tim Balk<!-- --> from New York and <!-- -->Annie Correal<!-- --> from Mexico City.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>11</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>U.S. Deportee In El Salvador Is in Isolation, Senator Says<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/christopher-van-hollen-jr">Christopher Van Hollen Jr</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/nayib-bukele">Nayib Bukele</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</strong><strong>:</strong> Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/maryland-el-salvador-senator-van-hollen-abrego-garcia-deportation.html">traveled to El Salvador to press for the release of Abrego Garcia</a>, a state resident mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, which defied a Supreme Court order to retrieve him.</p></li><li><p><strong>Told to Leave:</strong> The Biden administration allowed 900,000 people to use an app to schedule appointments to cross the border.
