		<p>Day three of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">the VCT Pacific 2025 Stage 2 playoffs</a> is over, with the first two teams officially eliminated from the playoffs. Both teams that lost in the upper bracket and were sent down to lowers won games to keep their hopes alive, but in two very different ways.</p>



<p>In the first match of the day, two teams were not only fighting for their hopes of winning Stage 2, but also for their Champions hopes. <span data-ref-id="0">

</span> also had a little more on the line due to their Ascension-team status.</p>

<p>The series began on Lotus, with Nongshim running their double Controller comp alongside Deadlock and Neon, as DFM ran double Duelist with Raze and Yoru instead. After winning the pistol and converting the bonus, Nongshim rocketed to an 8-1 lead, with <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/31827/dambi">
		Dambi	</a>
</span> leading the charge on his signature Neon. DFM was able to get three rounds in a row to end their defense half, only down 8-4.</p>

<p>However, when Nongshim won the second pistol, that put DFM in a tough position; the defense half looked just as strong as the attack half, as <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/31828/francis">
		Francis	</a>
</span> stepped up to secure Lotus 13-6. </p>

<p>Ascent was next, which on paper was ideal for Nongshim as Lotus was their opponent&#39;s map pick. Swapping the Deadlock for Killjoy, Nongshim ran a similar composition to their Lotus, keeping Dambi on Neon. DFM opted for a more standard Ascent composition, with <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/6672/meiy">
		Meiy	</a>
</span> moving on Jett with double Initiator to assist. After winning their first pistol of the series, DFM seemed to finally find its footing. That was highlighted by a clean attack side by both <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/48577/gyen">
		gyen	</a>
</span> and Meiy, with the latter showing exactly why he was one of the best duelists in VCT Pacific statistically.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXS0vVlJzQY?si=tVDoI5h02IURl8Ob&amp;clip=UgkxZVjZeh83Mx9Ijzv-9jM1L0klFWXXpsOt&amp;clipt=ELCcnQMY6MWgAw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>Meiy gets four kills entering and defending A site against Nongshim.</em></p>

<p>The only rounds Nongshim was able to convert included DFM&#39;s bonus and two others, meaning they had to enter the half down 9-3. Not an impossible deficit to overcome, but with how defense-sided Ascent still is, DFM were in a comfortable position moving to the defense side with a big lead.</p>

<p>So, when the second half began with both a Nongshim pistol win and a bonus conversion, that 9-3 lead disappeared in a flash. Nongshim reached a 10-9 lead before DFM was able to get their first defense round win. The attack revolved around a well-thought-out Viper wall on A site, which Nongshim seems to have mastered regionally. This was the rare Ascent game where both teams dominated the attack side and struggled on defense, with <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/488/rb">

</span> and Dambi leading Nongshim to a near-perfect attack side and a 13-10 map win. The series was over, with the 2-0 sweep marking the final DFM game in VCT 2025. </p>

<p>As for Nongshim Redforce, their Champions hopes rely on running through the lower bracket, as they will face T1 in their second of four potential lower bracket matches.</p>



<p>The second match of the day had less immediate importance for the Champions picture for both teams, as both teams had paths to Paris qualification even if they lost. However, a win from Gen.G would make Paris nearly confirmed. If RRQ won, that kept them in the running with both points or a top-two finish in these Stage 2 playoffs.</p>

<p>Haven was the beginning of this series, with Gen.G picking this map while using double Controller and <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9196/t3xture">
		t3xture	</a>
</span> on Neon. RRQ ran double Duelist with Neon and Yoru, and the firepower helped them win the first pistol. After losing the bonus round, Gen.G was able to fight back thanks to t3xture stepping up on attack. Even as RRQ tied the map 5-5, Gen.G won the final two rounds to have a 7-5 lead at the half. After not only winning the second pistol but converting the bonus, Gen.G got to a lead that RRQ were unable to come back from, closing out Haven 13-10 to take the 1-0 series lead.</p>

<p>Next up was Sunset, and for their map pick, RRQ could not have had a worse start. The Waylay and Breach composition was getting picked apart by the Neon and Deadlock attack from Gen.G. Add to that a great performance from <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/34974/karon">
		Karon	</a>
</span>, and Gen.G were up 10-2 at the half. It looked like a formality that Gen.G would win the series and move on, but their defense side left a lot to be desired. RRQ saw an opening and took it, while <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/24895/jemkin">
		Jemkin	</a>
</span> looked a lot more comfortable with Waylay on the attack side. Just as Gen.G did to them in the previous half, RRQ won pistol, converted the bonus round, went on a run, and ended near-perfectly to win map two 13-11. Not only did they tie the series after being down 10-1, but Jemkin aced the final round to secure the comeback win.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXS0vVlJzQY?si=TJAQ56WUa2nE8tkN&amp;clip=UgkxssHQkp7WgxKB62XTz_RLXQqMpDI2qZo4&amp;clipt=EP75uQgY27K9CA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>Jemkin aces on Waylay to end the Sunset comeback against Gen.G.</em></p>

<p>That meant Corrode would be the decider, and Gen.G tried to shake off their poor defense half on Sunset to start Corrode strong. After winning pistol, Gen.G lost their antieco to an amazing round from <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/8497/monyet">
		Monyet	</a>
</span>. That could have been the start of the collapse, but they were able to finish their attack half only down 7-5, which looks solid on paper considering how defense-sided Corrode has been since its introduction to VCT. Yet, for the second map in a row, Gen.G struggled on defense, this time against the Neon and Waylay attack RRQ showed off. It was a full team effort from RRQ, as they only lost the bonus round and quickly won Corrode 13-6 and the series 2-1, keeping their regional win streak over Gen.G.</p>

<p>This knocks out Gen.G from the Stage 2 playoffs, while RRQ will face off against DRX in the lower bracket to see if they can keep their Champs hopes alive.</p>
