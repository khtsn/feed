Even that level was just a drop in the bucket, she said, but the medical evacuations trickled to a halt after Israel closed the border crossing. The petition demands that Israel create a transparent process for applications for medical evacuations.</p><p>“People don’t know where to turn,” Ms. Lustigman said. Even when people apply for evacuations, there does not appear to be a reasoned approach to when permission is granted, with some critically ill patients still waiting while less sick individuals who applied later are allowed out, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We didn’t ask Israel to treat people, just to move them in a humane tempo,” Ms. Lustigman said. The petition did not specifically seek that patients be transferred abroad, only that they not be blocked from access to medical care, but Israel prefers “due to security reasons” that they travel to a third country, she said.</p><p>An unstated reason might be Israeli public opinion, she added. “There is a very strong public objection to the petition as it is,” she said.</p><p>Nonetheless, Ms. Lustigman argued, Israel has responsibility for civilians because it controls Gaza and its borders. “The state is subject to fundamental principles of Israeli law, the principles of administrative law, the Basic Laws, and the rules of natural justice,” Ms. Lustigman noted, and it has obligations under international treaties.</p><p>The Supreme Court set urgent hearings about the matter over the summer. Lawyers for Israel expressed agreement on the need for medical evacuations but sought more time in court to show the state was complying. And some permits were granted in the interim. At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/world/middleeast/gaza-medical-evacuation-children.html" title="">19 sick children</a>, most of them cancer patients, were permitted to leave Gaza for treatment in late June.</p><p>But the court’s order on Tuesday puts the focus on the state, the defense minister and the authority responsible for humanitarian coordination in Gaza, known as COGAT, to clarify how the process works. The state has argued at hearings that there is a system, Ms. Lustigman said, but has yet to convincingly show it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Israel has until Nov. 11 to provide a response, based on the court’s order. The justice ministry declined to comment on the order. COGAT and the defense ministry did not immediately respond to queries.</p><p>“Every day that passes with sick and injured individuals in Gaza left without medical treatment means human lives, children, and infants are in jeopardy,” Ms. Lustigman and her colleague, Tamir Blank, a lawyer for Physicians for Human Rights Israel who worked on the petition, said in a statement on Tuesday. “The state is obligated to allow access to medical treatment so that those who can still be saved may be saved.”</p><p>For many patients, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/rafah-palestinians-gaza-trapped.html" title="">it is already too late</a>. After months of waiting, Fida Ghanem, 42, was granted a permit by Israel and Egypt to leave Gaza for urgent lymphoma treatment in the spring, just before Israeli forces seized the Rafah crossing. With the crossing closed, she died in Gaza in June. The border crossing is still shut.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
