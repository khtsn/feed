I said good morning to my “Little Mintita” and had a cup of coffee. Then I combed my hair and saw that my beard wasn’t looking great, so I had to line it up. And we’re looking clean. I then left to get some drinking water, and when I got back I watched TikToks on my phone with my ultra-fast Wi-Fi. But then I remembered I had to wash my polo shirt. I put my headphones on, filled the bucket with water, dipped it in, added some soap and started washing it. When I was done, I squeezed the water out of it, and I don’t know what they had to call this. We’ll just say “Da.” I cooked some lunch then and watched a movie, but I got so bored so I went to swim.

So after breakfast, I washed some of my clothes, and then I and my brother went to get some connection. But we left because it was hot. I feel like I’m burning. Had to go back to the tent. Then I got real bored, so I thought that I could hang out with some of my friends and do something. We decided to build a 15-minute hangout tent. Of course, we didn’t expect something big, but it came out good. Then we played Monopoly and as we were playing this interrupted us. We proceeded to play anyway, but I lost badly. Then I went back to the tent and did nothing. I waited until the sun set and I watched the sunset on the beach. What a beautiful scene.

Let’s get it. I started my day with going quote unquote, shopping in the market. And, well, the reason that I’m saying, quote unquote, is that there is literally nothing to buy. It’s like every single shop I went to was straight up empty, for lack of a better word. And I just ended up buying two onions for $5. Like what? Now, if you haven’t been following up with the news recently, the reason behind this situation is that the crossing point where aid and products used to come from has been closed for almost two weeks now. Now, there has been some news going around that is going to be open in the next couple of days, but well, nothing is guaranteed. I just hope the situation gets better soon, Inshallah. Once I got home, I started training for the handstand and I actually got some decent attempts today. I feel like I’m really close to mastering it. I just need to work a little bit on my balance and we’ll be good to go. After my handstand training session, I had some canned chicken for lunch, then I went on my way to the gym and today I can say my winter arc has officially started. It has been really cold for the past couple of days. And as you can see, this is my first time wearing full sleeve since I started my journey. And now, I just look like I’ve never went to the gym in my life. Anyways, I had a back and biceps workout today and man, the winter arc vibe just hits different. Once I got home, I had some canned chicken leftovers from my post-workout meal and around sunset I went out to get some internet to get some stuff done. And that was it for the day. If you would like to know more about my life as gym bro and the fitness lover here in Gaza, I have a lot of videos like this on my account where I tell you about my daily life, as well as some fitness skills that I’m trying to learn. So drop a follow to be a part of my journey, and I’ll see you in the next video.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/31vid-gaza-vlogger-35847-cover/31vid-gaza-vlogger-35847-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">@Gym_rat_in_gaza via Instagram.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Why not grab this opportunity to talk to the world?” he said in a recent interview from Khan Younis while refilling his supply of water. Mr. Faris said he had raised nearly $13,000 online since he started posting videos, and hoped to eventually evacuate his family from Gaza. He said his audience enjoyed it when he incorporated memes and jokes. “I like to add this touch of sense of humor,” he said.</p><p>But he struggles with the instability of being displaced from his home and the scarcity of healthy foods, he said. Finding stable internet connections can be a challenge, and he sometimes waits hours for a video to upload.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“What I want people to receive from my vlogs is that we are trying to cope with the situation,” he said.</p><p>The fighting has pushed most Gazans into shrinking areas designated by Israel as “humanitarian zones,” though U.N. officials and aid groups have said that no place in Gaza is safe and they fear <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/25/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas" title="">famine</a>.</p><p>Some viewers have criticized Mr. al-Halimy and others like him, accusing them of sharing misinformation, or questioning their struggle given their lighthearted messaging.</p><p>“I’m just showing you the 1 percent of my life — the 1 percent that I’m trying to have fun,” he said in a video posted in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@medohalimy/video/7374904194530069777" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">May</a>.

And you guys need to understand something: If I show you that I am actually enjoying my life and that I’m trying to have fun, that doesn’t mean that I’m actually happy. That doesn’t mean that I’m not suffering. That doesn’t mean that I’m not starving. All the things you see about the war that’s happening right now, it’s actually happening to me. I’m just showing you the 1 percent of my life. The 1 percent that I’m trying to have fun. I’m just showing you the part where I try to enjoy, where I try to have fun. I’m a positive person. That’s just me. I try to enjoy life no matter what’s happening, no matter what I’m going through. You guys have no idea what we’ve been through. We’ve been through hell. I’ve seen death more than three times during the last seven months, seven and a half months. I don’t know. And I’m telling you, it’s not a good experience. You do not want to try. I don’t wish this experience for anyone, even my enemies. I don’t wish that for them because what I’ve been through is — it’s not easy. Just imagine a life with no electricity. Very, very scarce amount of drinking water and not drinking water. Very scarce amount of food, which is not even food. It’s just canned food and it’s very scarce. You know, I haven’t had real chicken in so long. I haven’t had real meat, red meat, in so long. Like all of this real food, we haven’t had any of this in so long. We’re just having canned food, which is super unhealthy.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/01/01vid-gaza-vloggers-83183-cover/01vid-gaza-vloggers-83183-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">@medo_halimy via Instagram.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-31235c50">A Global Reach</h2><p>Even before the war, young Palestinians were adopting the lighter tone of online social media to conduct what Dr. Cervi calls “playful activism,” pointing to TikTok trends that incorporate humor to make political points.</p><p>The insistence on sharing everyday routines or incorporating a lighter tone into material about the war, she added, is its own form of defiance.</p><p>“It’s very political because they’re saying, ‘We’re surviving and we will keep on,’” she said. Framing these videos as lifestyle content, she said, makes it more likely that social media algorithms will share them with a broader audience.</p><p>Activists elsewhere have used playfully framed videos on social media platforms to share messaging about other causes, Dr. Cervi said, such as the struggle to combat the killing of women in Latin America.</p><p>Researchers say that social media postings not only can elevate causes, but also tend to simplify them by removing nuance and centering each creator’s perspective.

He said in July that his family had decided to stay together in Gaza, instead of being separated. His online following was growing fast, and he hoped to raise enough money for them all to leave.</p><p>On Aug. 25, he shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_GT2dmP5nO/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his final video</a> on Instagram. The next afternoon, according to a friend who was with him, Mr. al-Halimy was at a makeshift cafe in Khan Younis when he was struck in the head by shrapnel from an Israeli airstrike. His brother, Zeid al-Halimy, said that he died at a Khan Younis hospital.</p><p>The Israeli military said it was not aware of an airstrike in the area that day.</p><p>In the months since Mr. al-Halimy’s death, his followers have been rewatching his videos and have left dozens of tributes in the comments. Some vowed to plant mint in their own gardens to remember him, and a fund-raising effort for his family has surged to more than $137,000.</p><p>Weeks after his death, Ms. Taft, who had never met Mr. al-Halimy in person, said she still thought about him every day. She compared losing him to another recent blow, the death of a close school friend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“It’s the same feeling of loss,” she said.</p><p>Other Palestinians she followed online are never far from her mind.</p><p>“I’m wondering who the next one is going to be,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
