Those actions were part of a “buy-or-bury strategy,” the F.T.C. said.</p><p>Ultimately, the purchases coalesced Meta’s power, depriving consumers of other social networking options and edging out competition, the government said.</p><p>“For more than 100 years, American public policy has insisted firms must compete if they want to succeed,&#34; said Daniel Matheson, the F.T.C.’s lead litigator in the case, in his opening remarks. “The reason we are here is that Meta broke the deal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” he added.</p><p>The trial — Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/zuckerberg-testifies-meta-trial-ftc.html" title="">poses the most consequential threat to the business empire</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-free-speech.html" title="">Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder</a>. If the government succeeds, the F.T.C. would most likely ask Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, potentially shifting the way that Silicon Valley does business and altering a long pattern of big tech companies snapping up younger rivals.</p><p>Still, legal experts cautioned that it might be challenging for the F.T.C. to win. That’s because the government must prove something unknowable: that Meta, formerly known as Facebook, wouldn’t have achieved the same success without the acquisitions. It is also extremely rare to try to unwind mergers approved years ago, legal experts said.</p><p>“One of the most difficult things for antitrust laws to deal with is when industry leaders purchase small potential competitors,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior official in the Obama administration’s Department of Justice. Meta, he added, “bought many things that either didn’t pan out or were integrated. How are Instagram and WhatsApp different?”</p><p>The F.T.C.’s case against Meta is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/antitrust-google-amazon-apple-meta.html" title="">third major tech antitrust lawsuit</a> to go to trial in the past two years. Last year, the D.O.J. won its antitrust case against Google for monopolizing internet search. A federal judge is set to hear arguments over remedies, including a potential breakup, next week. The D.O.J. also completed a separate trial against Google for monopolizing ad technology, which is still being decided by a federal judge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Justice Department has also sued Apple, and the F.T.C. has sued Amazon, accusing the companies of antitrust violations. Those trials are expected to begin next year.</p><p>The case against Meta could affect its 3.5 billion users, who on average log onto Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp multiple times a day for news, shopping and texting. Instagram and WhatsApp have attracted more users in recent years as Facebook, Meta’s flagship app, has stopped growing.</p><p>F.T.C. Chairman Andrew Ferguson was in the courtroom to listen to the government’s opening statement. Meta’s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead, and Joel Kaplan, its chief global affairs officer, also attended.</p><p>Presiding over the case is Judge James Boasberg, 62, the senior judge in the federal court. He is already in the national spotlight for rejecting the Trump administration’s effort to use a powerful wartime statute to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants it deemed to be members of a violent street gang.</p><p>Judge Boasberg said he had never been a user of Meta’s apps, but was familiar with Facebook Live, which has been featured in criminal trials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>During what is projected to be an eight-week trial, the government and Meta are expected to tell competing versions of the company’s 20-year growth story.</p><p>The F.T.C.’s argument hinges on Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which forbids a company from maintaining a monopoly through anticompetitive practices.</p><p>The F.T.C. accused Facebook, as the company was previously known, of struggling to build a mobile app and fearing that Instagram would rapidly outpace it in popularity. The company overpaid when it purchased Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, the F.T.C. argued.</p><p>In 2014, as WhatsApp grew, Meta offered to buy the company for $19 billion — also far above its market value, the government said.</p><p>The F.T.C. plans to highlight a paper trial of emails between Meta executives, alongside other evidence, to argue that the company bought the start-ups because they were threats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In his opening remarks, Mr. Matheson mentioned documents, including what he described as a “smoking gun” 2012 email by Mr. Zuckerberg about the rise of Instagram. In the email Mr. Zuckerberg described the importance to “neutralize a potential competitor.”</p><p>Years after the acquisition, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in an internal email in 2018 that Instagram’s success risked cannibalizing user engagement on the flagship Facebook app, Mr. Matheson said. That resulted in decisions to not to promote Instagram on the Facebook app and to reduce ad loads on Instagram.</p><p>There’s “a real chance we may be causing network collapse of the more engaging and more profitable product to replace it with one that is less engaging and less profitable,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in the email to executives. </p><p>The F.T.C. lawyer said Meta bought WhatsApp to to keep it from being acquired by competitors like Google, who were trying to use a messaging service to launch a competing social network. The acquisition was intended to build a “moat” around the company’s monopoly in social networking, Mr. Matheson said.</p><p>At the center of the trial is differing definitions of the social networking market. The F.T.C. argued on Monday that Mr. Zuckerberg told users in 2006 that Facebook was used to connect “actual friends.” The F.T.C. has argued that the main competition to Facebook and Instagram is SnapChat. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Meta has disagreed, saying they face competition from TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube and other platforms that divert attention from Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>The government is set to call witnesses from Meta, as well as competitors, venture capitalists, economists and media industry executives. Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to be called as the first witness as soon as Monday. The F.T.C. said former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, and Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, will testify this week.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cecilia Kang reports on technology and regulatory policy for The Times from Washington.
