But analysts — and Mr. Sullivan on Thursday — cautioned that a deal was not yet sealed. Over the past year, repeated rounds of talks have seen hopes rise only to be dashed days later, with both Israel and Hamas blaming the other for the impasse.</p><p>From Israel Mr. Sullivan plans to travel on to Qatar and Egypt, the main countries, along with the United States, involved in mediating a deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“You can’t rest until it actually happens. It might not happen,” Mr. Sullivan said at the news conference, adding, “but I believe it can happen with political will on both sides.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has indicated “that he would like to see this done,” Mr. Sullivan said. He added, “We see movement from Hamas,” alluding to possible flexibility in some of the group’s core demands.</p><p>More than a year ago, a temporary cease-fire in Gaza allowed for the release of scores of hostages who had been captured during the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators calling for the release of hostages held in Gaza, outside the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv on Thursday during a visit by Mr. Sullivan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stoyan Nenov/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Attempts to reach another cease-fire and to secure the release of the remaining 100 or so hostages still in Gaza — at least a third of whom are presumed dead — have so far floundered.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The demands of both sides have been mutually exclusive: Hamas had been holding out for a permanent cease-fire that committed Israel to ending the war and withdrawing all its troops from Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu has publicly rejected ending the war until Hamas’s rule in Gaza is over.</p><p>But the latest talks aimed at breaking the long stalemate are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-cease-fire-talks.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">quietly advancing behind the scenes</a>, according to mediators and officials, with Hamas officials now considering the possibility of an extended Israeli presence along parts of two strategic corridors in Gaza.</p><p>Mediators have floated a deal beginning with a 60-day cease-fire, similar to the agreement Israel and Hezbollah reached to end the fighting in Lebanon that involves a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from the country’s south.</p><p>Mr. Sullivan said that the basic elements and framework of a three-<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/us/politics/biden-israel-remarks-speech.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">phase cease-fire and hostage deal laid out by President Biden in May</a> were “still alive and part of the discussions that are happening today.” He described that framework as a road map to ending the war and to “a future of Gaza without Hamas in power.”</p><p>He suggested that the current effort was meant to get agreement on the initial phase resulting in “images of hostages being welcomed home to their families,” to be followed by more negotiations aimed at moving from the first short-term cease-fire to the second phase, which, under the May proposal, would involve more exchanges as well as the end of all hostilities and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Details of the potential deal remain scant, however, with the negotiations taking place behind closed doors. After Mr. Sullivan’s meeting on Thursday with Israeli leaders, Mr. Netanyahu’s office put out a statement that made no mention of Gaza or a prospective cease-fire and hostage-release deal, focusing instead on the dramatic events in Syria.</p><p>Mr. Sullivan, for his part, attributed what he described as the “different character” of the current negotiations to Hamas’s increasing isolation.</p><p>“We believe Hamas was waiting for lots of other actors and forces to come to their rescue,” he said, but the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, Hamas’s ally in Lebanon, made it clear that the conflicts to Israel’s north and south had been “decoupled.”</p><p>The fall of the Assad regime in Syria has also changed the regional dynamics, he said, contributing to the cease-fire talks’ momentum. He also noted Israel’s military progress against Hamas’s infrastructure and the decimation of the group’s military and its senior leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man takes a selfie near an abandoned and partially destroyed Syrian Army helicopter in the military section of the airport in Aleppo, days after an offensive by a coalition of rebels led to President Bashar al-Assad fleeing the country.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Pressure from President-elect Donald J. Trump also appears to have injected a new sense of urgency into the process. Mr. Trump wrote last week on social media that there would be “ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East” if the hostages weren’t released by the time of his inauguration in January.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>With respect to the incoming administration, Mr. Sullivan said Biden administration officials have been coordinating with their successors and keeping them “apprised of how the negotiations are unfolding.”</p><p>In signs of serious intentions, David Barnea, the chief of Israel’s Mossad foreign intelligence service, and one of his country’s primary negotiators, traveled to Qatar for talks on Wednesday, returning to Israel before dawn on Thursday, and has been working with Egypt and Turkey, where some Hamas officials are now located, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>And the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed group in Gaza that is believed to be holding some of the hostages, sent a delegation including its chief, Ziad al-Nakhala, to Cairo on Wednesday to discuss developments related to a potential hostage deal.</p><p>But experts have also sought to temper expectations. While the Biden administration is clearly eager to close a deal and notch one more success before leaving office, other actors, they say, only have an interest in projecting seriousness so as not to be blamed by Mr. Trump for any failure of the process.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
