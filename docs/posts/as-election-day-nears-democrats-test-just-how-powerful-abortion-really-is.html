Wade was overturned in 2022. </p><p>But they remain less certain about how many of these newly engaged abortion rights voters will then support Democratic candidates.</p><p>“The central question is, how much does abortion persuade people to vote for Democrats?” said Angela Kuefler, a Democratic strategist working on several abortion rights measures. “The issue itself is still of utmost importance to people. It is still a big driver when it comes to their vote decision. The question is just the ceiling.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In Arizona and Nevada, the presidential race is tight, but measures enshrining abortion rights in state constitutions are expected to cruise to victory. In Montana, Democrats are struggling to hold a Senate seat but expect to pass a similar abortion rights referendum. And in Missouri, voters appear ready to back an abortion rights measure while also re-electing Senator Josh Hawley, one of the strongest opponents of abortion rights in Congress.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Missouri, voters appear ready to back an abortion rights measure while also re-electing Senator Josh Hawley, one of the strongest opponents of abortion rights in Congress.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cheriss May for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The result could be a strange split screen: Voters act to protect abortion rights in their states but also elect senators who have vocally supported restrictions, as well as former President Donald J. Trump, who has taken credit for overturning Roe.</p><p>There’s also the possibility that one or more of the measures could fail, an outcome that would be a first in the post-Roe environment.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe energized a new coalition of independents, liberals and some moderate Republicans behind Democratic candidates. Democrats embraced the issue as never before, marching to victories in midterm elections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Now, those new political tactics are being tested for the first time in the overwhelming heat of a presidential race.</p><p>There is little question that abortion rights remains one of the strongest election issues for Democrats. A series of polls have shown more voters prefer Ms. Harris on the issue over Mr. Trump, helping <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/harris-trump-election-gender.html" title="">drive a gender gap that is defining the race</a>.</p><p>But for a small yet potentially decisive percentage of voters, supporting abortion rights does not lead to checking the box for Ms. Harris.</p><p>About 12 percent of voters said they would vote for both Mr. Trump and an abortion-rights referendum, according to New York Times/Siena College surveys in Arizona and Florida. While the polls found that a slight majority of these voters trust Mr. Trump to handle the issue of abortion rights more than Ms. Harris, most of them also do not rank the issue as a top priority.</p><p>“If you are generally a pro-life Republican, who still wants some legal avenue for abortion, you’ll vote yes on that measure — but you’re still not a Democrat,” said Barrett Marson, a Republican strategist in Arizona who is supporting Ms. Harris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Trent Wichmann, 20, a student from Florida, said he planned to vote for the amendment because he believes a woman should be able to make her own decisions. But he also said he’s also going to vote for Mr. Trump.</p><p>“The main reason is his high focus on our borders. I think that is a huge problem,” he said.</p><p>Democrats are also facing an electorate that is not always well-informed.</p><p>In battleground states, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/upshot/abortion-biden-trump-blame.html" title="">one in five voters</a> wrongly blame President Biden for ending the constitutional right to an abortion, even though Mr. Trump was the one who appointed the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe.</p><p>Mr. Trump himself has struggled to settle on a clear position, equivocating before embracing the stance that the issue should be left to the states — a message quickly adapted by Republicans in key races — when he talks about the issue at all.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>All the same, Republicans are breathing easier in swing states without abortion rights measures on the ballot.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two years ago, there was an abortion measure on the ballot in Michigan. This year, in the swing state, there is not. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a state constitutional right to abortion and also elected Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, largely because of her support for abortion rights.</p><p>This year in Michigan, there is no abortion measure. Republicans argue that allows voters to focus more on economic issues like inflation and high housing costs where polling indicates that their party has an edge.</p><p>“People feel good about the fact that it’s a done issue in Michigan,” said Tudor Dixon, the Republican candidate who opposed abortion in cases of rape and incest and lost to Ms. Whitmer. “It changes every race because now we can focus on issues that affect every family.”</p><p>While abortion rights groups prevailed in all seven abortion ballot measures since Roe fell, they occurred during midterm and off-year elections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In presidential elections, the electorate expands, making the political environment more unpredictable for candidates.</p><p>“This is our first presidential year since the fall of Roe. It means that voters are turning out for a lot of other reasons beside the ballot measure,” said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which supports abortion rights ballot measures in red and purple states. “They may be making their partisan choices on immigration, on the economy, on infrastructure, on jobs.”</p><p>Some of the ballot initiatives themselves are also facing steeper challenges this year.</p><p>Ms. Hall sees a path to victory in all five states where her group is working — Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Montana and Nebraska — but noted that the measures in Florida and Nebraska face significant opposition.</p><p>To pass, the Florida initiative requires support from more than 60 percent of voters, a threshold higher than any previous measure had to meet. While voters have turned out in more conservative states, including Kansas and Ohio, to support abortion rights, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_abortion_ballot_measures" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they haven’t exceeded 60 percent in any of those states</a>.</p><p>In Nebraska, there will be two competing measures on the ballot — a first since Roe was overturned. One would enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution; the other would maintain the current ban on the procedure after 12 weeks, with limited exceptions. If voters pass both, the measure that wins the most support would be adopted in the state Constitution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For their part, anti-abortion activists say that even if all the abortion rights measures pass, their fight is far from over. They’re looking ahead to challenging the referendums in court and feel they can advance their agenda if Mr. Trump wins.</p><p>And as they survey the political landscape, they are hopeful that the political focus of Democrats on abortion rights may have hit a high-water mark.</p><p>“This isn’t something they will be able to do year after year,” said Kristi Hamrick, strategist for Students for Life. And, she said, “It will not be the end of what we can do state by state.”</p><p>Ruth Igielnik<!-- --> and <!-- -->Kellen Browning<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elizabeth Dias is The Times’s national religion correspondent, covering faith, politics and values.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/elizabeth-dias">More about Elizabeth Dias</a></span></p></div><div><p>Lisa Lerer is a national political reporter for The Times, based in New York.
