People keep asking if Trump is getting played by Putin, which is like asking if ‘Hava Nagila’ is getting played at a bar mitzvah.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“But both sides said the call went well, which makes sense, because they’re both on the same side.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“And, yeah, Russia actually described the call as ‘historic and epic.’ And nothing makes me feel safe like a happy Russia.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“But the White House said Putin agreed to a partial cease-fire. At least they think he did — it was tough to hear on the phone with Elon’s kids playing tag in the background.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-5f2d9576">The Punchiest Punchlines (Nine Months Later Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“Here’s some good news: Today, the Boeing astronauts who were stranded at the International Space Station for nine months finally returned to Earth.

I can’t wait.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Wait till they find out what’s been going on down here — they might go back up.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Trump, of course, took credit for the rescue mission. He says Joe Biden abandoned them, even though the rescue was planned by the Biden administration in August. Is there anything else from last summer he’d like to take credit for? Those gold medals Simone Biles won? She couldn’t have done that without him.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Still, it is nice to see Trump bring something down other than the stock market for a change.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Our co-president, Elon Musk, sent a SpaceX vehicle to bring the astronauts back.
