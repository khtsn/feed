Its editorial board will vanish, as will its clippable sports photos and pages of printed obituaries.</p><p>Its sister publication, The Jersey Journal, one of the earliest holdings in the Newhouse media family’s now-vast empire, will <a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/jersey-journal-requiem-closure-helene-stapinski-jersey-city.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cease to exist in print or online,</a> leaving Hudson County, N.J. — a hotbed for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/nyregion/bob-menendez-corruption-sentencing.html" title="">political corruption</a> — without a daily newspaper. Three other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/nyregion/nj-star-ledger-jersey-journal-newspapers.html" title="">affiliated papers</a>, The Times of Trenton, The South Jersey Times and The Hunterdon County Democrat, will stop printing and offer only digital news.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The decision to shut the outlets coincides with a steep <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/05/07/americans-views-on-the-financial-health-of-local-news/pj_2024-05-07_local-news-trends_5-04/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nationwide decline</a> in newspaper readership that has contributed to the closure of <a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/2024/report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 3,200 papers</a> in the United States since 2005, according to the Local News Initiative at Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism. (The Jersey Journal, which for 157 years has been based in New Jersey’s most densely populated county, was selling just <a href="https://www.nj.com/hudson/2024/10/after-157-years-of-keeping-hudson-county-informed-the-jersey-journal-to-close-in-2025.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2,600 papers</a> a day.)</p><p>But The Ledger’s demise also leaves New Jersey with what researchers say is the distinction of being only the second state in the country to have its primary paper move completely online. In 2023, The Ledger’s <a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parent company</a> similarly <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/11/alabama-media-group-shifts-to-all-digital-will-stop-publishing-newspapers-in-2023.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stopped printing a statewide newspaper</a> in Alabama as it beefed up its Pulitzer Prize-winning <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2023/05/alcom-wins-two-pulitzer-prizes-one-for-local-reporting-one-for-commentary.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online news site</a> there.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
