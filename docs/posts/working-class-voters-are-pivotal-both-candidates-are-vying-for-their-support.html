</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Yet America’s recent burst of inflation has put a serious dent in the nation’s economic confidence, and it has been especially tough for those on a tight budget. After decades of economic backsliding, many working-class voters are eager to hear that significant changes are coming — and are skeptical of the experts who say Mr. Trump’s promises to remake America might do little to benefit them.</p><p>The upshot is that Ms. Harris’s targeted economic proposals, many of which aim at the working class, may not be enough to change political reality. America’s blue-collar voters have been turning increasingly red in recent years, and they seem to be leaning in that direction once again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“Concrete, specific political promises are often not as powerful in the electorate as emotional appeals that tap into fears and anxieties,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J.

Mr. Trump appears to be poised to maintain that foothold on Tuesday.</p><p>A national <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/27/us/elections/times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">New York Times/Siena College</a> poll of the nation’s likely electorate taken in late October found that 64 percent of white voters without a college degree planned to cast a ballot for Mr. Trump, and just 34 percent for Ms. Harris. And while Ms. Harris retains much higher support among nonwhite voters without a college degree, support from Democrats has been slipping over time even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/upshot/trump-black-hispanic-voters-harris.html" title="">among minority voters</a>.</p><p>The reasons for the shift are complex. Some are economic — tied to the erosion of unions and a loss of manufacturing jobs — and others are cultural.</p><p>“Even before Trump appeared, white working-class culture began turning more conservative and Republican,” said Paul Clark, a professor at Pennsylvania State University who studies labor and employment relations. He said that being a Trump voter had increasingly become an identity: It often goes right along with owning a truck and a gun in battleground states like Pennsylvania.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump has branded himself as a “blue-collar billionaire” who embraces irreverence and wears trucker hats. He’s famously rich, which political scientists said made him an aspirational model for many voters.</p><p>But the shift also comes as Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris are offering very different visions of the economic future. And if the analyses are right, it may mean that the working class is poised to vote against its self-interest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump’s economic proposals amount to a bid to restore an economy of the past, when America was more industrial and more dependent on fossil fuels.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-27459549">‘Robin Hood in Reverse’</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s economic proposals amount to a disruptive bid to restore an economy of the past — one in which America was more industrial and more squarely dependent on fossil fuels.</p><p>The former president is pledging to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">lift tariffs even more</a> than he did in his first term. He has promised the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/elections/trump-deportation.html" title="">largest deportation operation</a> in American history.” And he says he will lower prices by encouraging domestic oil and gas production to drive fuel costs lower. He argues that cheaper fuel will lower the costs of other products and prod the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, though economists and oil analysts have voiced skepticism about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/us/politics/trump-economics-gas-tariffs-inflation.html" title="">the feasibility</a> of such plans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At the same time, Mr. Trump has proposed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-policy.html" title="">smorgasbord of tax cuts</a>, including no taxes on tips. Which proposals would actually pass and how much they might help the working class are unclear, because much depends on how they would be structured.</p><p>But several analysts pointed out that <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/the-2017-trump-tax-law-was-skewed-to-the-rich-expensive-and-failed-to-deliver" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the tax cuts</a> passed in 2017 provided the largest benefits for the rich — and that Mr. Trump’s other proposals could push up prices, which could hurt the poor and working class. Tariffs are generally passed along to domestic producers and customers, so raising them is likely to lift prices. Sudden deportations could lead to overnight worker shortages in construction or agriculture, further pushing up prices.</p><p>“I call it Robin Hood in reverse: It’s this shift in resources away from the poor and working class and up the chain,” said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who worked at the Treasury Department in the Biden administration.</p><p>But Joe LaVorgna, a former chief economist of the White House National Economic Council under Mr. Trump, said it was important to understand the tariffs as part of Mr. Trump’s broader economic package, not as a stand-alone policy.</p><p>“The intent is to re-industrialize,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President Kamala Harris’s vision is one of greater economic continuity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-255e6e2f">Building on Biden</h2><p>Ms. Harris’s economic vision is one of greater continuity.</p><p><a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Her campaign has said</a> that she would resist unfair trading practices, but also that she “believes in upholding and strengthening international economic rules.” She has pledged to continue the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/13/business/economy/norway-inflation-reduction-act.html" title="">sweeping efforts</a> to ramp up clean energy development. She has talked about cutting costs for families, but has focused on doing so by lowering drug prices and giving incentives to increase home buying.

More than a dozen Nobel P<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/24/us/sci-pol-nobel-winners-pdf.html" title="">rize-winning economists</a> have signed an open letter supporting Ms. Harris.</p><p>And a Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis has found that Ms. Harris’s policies would be comparatively good for the bottom three-fifths of the income distribution, while Mr. Trump’s would be better for the richest groups. And that is without taking into account the effects of tariffs or deportations.</p><p>“There is no question that Harris is much more focused on lower-income, middle-income,” said Kent Smetters, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and head of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. And while Mr. Trump’s proposals do slightly boost lower-income earnings, “nothing is paid for in the case of Trump.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Both Penn Wharton and the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have estimated</a> that Ms. Harris’s proposals would add to the deficit and national debt by much less than Mr. Trump’s.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris greeting Gerardo Ramirez from Teamsters Local 104 at a campaign rally in Arizona.

Two <a href="https://teamster.org/2024/09/teamsters-release-presidential-endorsement-polling-data/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later</a> surveys showed that roughly 60 percent preferred him and just 30 percent preferred Ms. Harris.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Part of the longer-term problem for Democrats may be that the nation’s bottom half has been falling behind for decades. Wealth inequality has widened substantially, and there are fewer opportunities for economic progress, especially for those without a college degree.</p><p>“Working-class people — some working-class people — feel that the Democrats have not offered a meaningful solution to the blah economic situation they’ve seen,” said Jared Abbott, the director of the Center for Working-Class Politics, which aims to push progressives to focus more on workers.</p><p>That is what’s keeping Paul Brown, 47, from voting at all. Mr. Brown, who is Black, was headed into a Dollar General in a Philadelphia suburb on Sunday. He has worked in food production in the past, but an injury is preventing him from working right now, and it has been hard to keep up with his bills.</p><p>He doesn’t believe that either candidate will bring real changes for people like him, and he hasn’t cast a vote since Barack Obama ran for office. But his friends are split between voting for Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump.</p><p>When they’re voting for the former president, it is often because they think his policies benefited them economically — especially pandemic stimulus checks that went out under both Mr. Trump and President Biden, but that only Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-18/trump-name-on-covid-stimulus-checks-was-legal-irs-documents-reveal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a point of signing</a>.</p><p>“I’m like: I don’t think that was Trump,” Mr. Brown said.
