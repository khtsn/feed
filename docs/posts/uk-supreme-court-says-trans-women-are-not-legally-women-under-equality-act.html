    <h1>UK Supreme Court Says Trans Women Are Not Legally Women Under Equality Act</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Supreme Court in Britain ruled on Wednesday that trans women do not<strong> </strong>fall within the legal definition of women under the country’s equality legislation.</p><p>The landmark judgment, which said that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex, is a blow to campaigners for transgender rights, and could have far-reaching consequences for how the law is applied in Britain to single-sex spaces, equal pay claims and maternity policies.</p><p>It follows a yearslong legal battle over whether trans women can be regarded as female under Britain’s 2010 Equality Act, which aims to prevent discrimination. And it comes amid intense, and at times bitter public debate over the intersection of transgender rights and women’s rights.</p><p>Announcing the decision on Wednesday, the deputy president of the court, Lord Hodge, said: “The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms ‘woman’ and ‘sex’ in the Equality Act 2010 refer to biological women and biological sex.”</p></div></div>
