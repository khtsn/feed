Sometimes, relatives dial in from north India, or even the United States. They wait for Umar Khalid, 37, an Indian political activist, to appear on the screen from jail.</p><p>“How are you, Ammi?” Mr. Khalid boomed one recent day, addressing his mother, Sabiha Khanam.</p><p>“Everyone get in the frame, please,” he urged when he was unable to see a face but could hear a familiar voice.</p><p>In early 2020, Mr. Khalid became one of the most prominent figures of India’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/world/asia/new-delhi-hindu-muslim-violence.html" title="">biggest and most energized protests</a> in a generation, a three-month outpouring of opposition to government proposals widely seen as anti-Muslim.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He was arrested later that year, and he has now languished in jail for four years without a trial, making him a symbol of the wide-ranging suppression of dissent under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It continues unabated even with Mr. Modi’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/world/asia/india-election-modi.html" title="">reduced mandate after elections</a> in the spring.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, left, and Sabiha Khanam, Mr. Khalid’s parents, on a video call with him on Tuesday at their home in New Delhi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saumya Khandelwal for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>To silence opponents like Mr. Khalid, Mr. Modi’s government has increasingly turned to a draconian state security law that in the past was used only to quell violent insurgencies. Activists and other dissenters targeted under the law can be held in pretrial detention almost indefinitely. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/05/world/asia/india-jailed-priest-dies.html" title="">Some have died</a> while awaiting bail. Even if they do move toward trial, defendants are often bogged down in years of legal battles.</p><p>Mr. Modi’s government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/world/asia/modi-india-gandhi-judiciary.html" title="">has worked to bend the judicial system to its will</a> and wield it as a weapon against a range of adversaries. When the dissenting voice is Muslim, as in Mr. Khalid’s case, the hammer brandished by the Hindu-nationalist government comes down even harder, activists and family members say.</p><p>Mr. Khalid was detained under the state security law after he made antigovernment speeches and participated in WhatsApp groups that were organizing protests. He was <a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/religious-prisoners-conscience/forb-victims-database/umar-khalid" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused of instigating riots</a> in Delhi that left more than 50 people dead. Most of the victims were Muslims who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/india-violence-hindu-muslim.html" title="">died at the hands of Hindu mobs.</a></p><p>Ever since, he and his family have been caught in a cruel routine.</p><p>Mr. Khalid’s application for bail was rejected three times in lower courts, said his father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas. His bail hearing in the country’s highest court has been postponed <a href="https://thewire.in/law/a-timeline-of-umar-khalids-bail-hearings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least a dozen times</a>. On at least two occasions, Mr. Khalid has been taken to court, only for the judge to recuse himself and send the defendant back to his cell.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Khalid, center, and other students in 2016 during a protest at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ravi Choudhary/Hindustan Times, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“As they say, the process is the punishment,” said Mr. Ilyas, Mr. Khalid’s father. “Sometimes the judge recuses himself, sometimes the lawyers are not available.”</p><p>In India today, “one has to pay a price for speaking the truth,” Mr. Ilyas said. “And it is very easy to frame someone with a Muslim name these days.”</p><p>Mr. Khalid challenged Mr. Modi just as the prime minister was riding high after a sweeping <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/world/asia/narendra-modi-election-win.html" title="">election victory in 2019</a>, which cemented his position as India’s most powerful leader in decades.</p><p>After the election, Mr. Modi moved swiftly on a slate of divisive policies advancing the longtime wishes of his Hindu-nationalist support base.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-jammu.html" title="">revoked the special autonomous status</a> of the Muslim-majority Kashmir region. He laid the foundation stone for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-jammu.html" title="">grand Hindu temple to be built</a> at a site long disputed between Hindus and Muslims. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--49S5Wx7n8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">His government announced</a> plans for a national citizen registry that was widely seen as potentially denying citizenship to Muslims.</p><p>Protests erupted after the government passed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/22/world/asia/modi-india-citizenship-law.html" title="">a law granting a path to Indian citizenship</a> to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from nearby countries who had been living in India. Muslims were pointedly excluded.</p><p>The government said the law was not about Indian Muslims, but instead about giving oppressed minorities in India’s neighborhood a new start.</p><p>But many Muslims in India saw the measure as part of a design. Once the citizen registry went into effect, they feared, they would be deprived of citizenship if they could not present proof of lineage in India.</p><p>The protests over the citizenship law spread quickly. In the Delhi neighborhood of <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/dynamic/render?uri=nyt://newsletter/9baec934-e0c7-4a13-b027-ab96a95031f8" title="">Shaheen Bagh, thousands of women</a> held a sit-in for months.
