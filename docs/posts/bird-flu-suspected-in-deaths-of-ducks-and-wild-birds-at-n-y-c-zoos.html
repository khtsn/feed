Kathy Hochul ordered all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/nyregion/nyc-bird-flu-markets.html" title="">live bird markets in New York City</a> and a few surrounding counties to close temporarily in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. “Safeguarding public health is all about being proactive,” she said in a statement.</p><p>The order, from the state’s Department of Agriculture and Markets, requires live bird markets that have not detected any bird flu cases to sell their inventories and disinfect their operations. Markets with detected cases must follow guidelines for quarantine and depopulation, the order said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The virus, called H5N1, has infected roughly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">156 million</a> commercial, backyard and wild birds across the country since January 2022. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the illness poses minimal risks to the general public’s health, and that it does not yet have the ability to spread readily among people.</p><p>The Wildlife Conservation Society, which also operates the Central Park Zoo, the Prospect Park Zoo and the New York Aquarium on Coney Island, said that, as a precaution, the organization had recently moved vulnerable bird species to separate, protected areas inside its parks. It has also limited the exposure of other animals in its care to wild birds and especially to waterfowl, which are known to be carriers of the virus.</p><p>“We have assessed and reviewed our protocols regarding risk to our birds from avian influenza,” the nonprofit said in a statement. “Our veterinarians and curators continue to closely monitor the situation in the region and are collaborating with city, state and federal agencies.”</p><p>The Bronx and Queens Zoos remained open on Saturday, the organization said, noting the low risk of visitors coming into contact with zoo birds or contracting the virus.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon at the Queens Zoo, Marck Vasquez and Jennifer Espinoza said they were sad to find that the swans, one of their favorite attractions, were not in their usual pond surrounded by wild birds, but instead alone in a separate enclosure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It feels empty,” said Mr. Vasquez, 21.</p><p>Nearby, another visitor, Chawsu, 36, who is originally from Myanmar, strolled by a pond where scores of wild mallards swam. Ms. Chawsu said she was sad the flu was sickening birds but that she was otherwise unconcerned.</p><p>“I’m coming from a country where every year we have bird flu,” Ms. Chawsu said. “It’s not a worry to me.”</p><p>Ellen Yan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maia Coleman writes about breaking news and the criminal justice system in New York City and its surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maia-coleman">More about Maia Coleman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
