When the Palestinian militant group Hamas released her last month, she was dressed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb3zfpY1J94" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a bright magenta</a> track suit and looked pale.</p><p>Sitting in front of a camera again took her back to the difficult moments when her captors filmed her in Gaza, Ms. Steinbrecher, 31, said in the video, looking composed and smiling at times.</p><p>“This time, I’m sitting comfortably on a couch with my family watching me in a warm and pleasant place,” she said. Trying to convey that she had not been broken, she said it was important for her to show everyone that “I’m OK.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As families and sympathizers at home and abroad doggedly campaigned for the release of the Israeli hostages, most people knew them only as faces staring out from posters. Now, with 16 Israelis released since Jan. 19 under the cease-fire deal with Hamas, those haunting faces are coming to life in video clips, social media posts and statements from relatives that provide glimpses of the joy and relief of freedom as well as hints of the torment they have endured.</p><p>The brief messages they have sent out have mostly been expressions of gratitude to all those who worked for their release and pleas not to give up until the last hostage is freed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A picture made available from the Israeli government of Doron Steinbrecher with her relatives after she was released.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Israeli Government, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The urgency of that message became even clearer on Saturday, when many Israelis were shocked to see the emaciated condition of the latest three hostages who were released: Eli Sharabi, 52; Or Levy, 34; and Ohad Ben-Ami, 56.</p><p>Some relatives have said that the hostages released earlier were often deprived of food, suffered severe loss of weight and muscle mass and rarely saw sunlight. Family members said some of the hostages had at least occasional access to radio or television and heard or saw their relatives campaigning for their release, which helped them survive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Col. Avi Benov, a doctor and deputy chief of the Israeli military’s medical corps, told reporters that several of the recently released female hostages had spent the last eight months underground <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/middleeast/gaza-hamas-israel-tunnels-hostages.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">in Hamas tunnels</a> in Gaza. Some hostages who were released in November 2023 have described suffocating humidity in the tunnels that made it difficult to breathe.</p><p>Colonel Benov said the first seven women recently released were all<span>   </span>suffering from “mild starvation,” while some still had shrapnel in their bodies from injuries they sustained on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>That was the day Hamas led an attack from Gaza on southern Israel that ended with about 1,200 dead and about 250 people taken back to Gaza as hostages. The attack ignited a 15-month war, with Israel’s offensive in Gaza killing tens of thousands of Palestinians and devastating the territory.</p><p>Of the roughly 250 captives, scores were released during a weeklong truce later that year while some have been killed in captivity. More than 70 hostages have not yet been returned, including at least 35 who are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli government.</p><p>A total of 25 hostages are expected to be released, along with the bodies of eight others, during the initial six-week cease-fire that took effect last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>They are being exchanged for about 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, some of them convicted of killing Israelis. Released Palestinians, many of whom had been held without charge, say they faced harsh conditions in Israeli jails and detention facilities.</p><p>Some of the Israeli hostages had been forced to appear in videos filmed by their captors in Gaza — a practice that rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/10/gaza-hostage-videos-outrage-personal-dignity" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have denounced as</a> inhumane treatment that could amount to a war crime. Israeli officials have called these a form of psychological warfare.</p><p>A few months ago, Hamas’s military wing issued a statement claiming that a hostage had been killed and released blurry images apparently showing a body wrapped in a shroud. One close-up shot showed a tattoo identical to one belonging to Daniella Gilboa, one of a number of female <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-spotters-hostages.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">lookout soldiers captured from a small military base</a> near the Gaza border.</p><p>But Ms. Gilboa, 20, was freed on Jan. 25. Days later, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/3856026044612244" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she was singing</a> at a party marking the discharge of the army lookouts from Beilinson Hospital near Tel Aviv.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Days after Ms. Gilboa was released, she was singing at a party marking the discharge of her and other former captives from Beilinson Hospital near Tel Aviv.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nir Keidar/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>She reflected on her ordeal in a lengthy Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFkV-CRNYK6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Feb. 2. She said her faith and observance of Jewish rituals had gotten her through. She thanked her supporters for not believing the rumors that she had been killed in Gaza.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Liri Albag, another one of the lookouts, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFpguitoIWg/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">celebrated her 20th birthday</a> while recovering at the hospital.</p><p>Ms. Steinbrecher was kidnapped from her home in Kfar Aza, a rural community near the Gaza border.</p><p>In the video she released, her appearance contrasted sharply with hostage videos made when she was pale, with blond hair pulled back in a braid. Her hair was now dark and neatly styled in a shoulder-length bob, and she dressed in black, wearing long necklaces, a dog tag and a yellow pin in solidarity with the hostages. She said she was no longer that person in the videos from Gaza.</p><p>“I’m Doron. I’m 31. I’m no longer in Hamas captivity, and I’m home,” she said.</p><p>The recently released hostages have remained largely protected from the glare of the news media and have not given any interviews so far. Medical and mental health professionals say that preserving their privacy is essential to the long healing process.</p><p>Footage released by the military of the hostages’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nhw5LFBMvzw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emotional reunions with close family members</a> have given a sense of the elation surrounding their return.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Dad, I came back alive!” another freed hostage, Romi Gonen, 24, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTkTrS7MK48" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shouted into a cellphone</a> after being reunited with her mother on Jan. 19.</p><p>Experts say that the long captivity caused physical and psychological harm, and that full rehabilitation will take time.</p><p>“We are walking a very slow path,” said Prof. Noa Eliakim-Raz, the head of the returnees’ ward at Beilinson Hospital. “Of course, we see ups and downs. Every day is different.”</p><p>Some of the freed hostages returned with injuries from the Oct. 7 assault. Emily Damari, 28, lost two fingers after being shot in the hand and was also shot in the leg.</p><p>She is a fan of the Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv, and at one of their matches on Monday, a video message from Ms. Damari was projected on a huge screen. She <a href="https://x.com/MaccabiTLVFC/status/1886482183243632821" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thanked the players, the management and the supporters</a> for fighting for her freedom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Emily Damari lost two fingers after being shot in the hand and was also shot in the leg.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Gonen is still suffering from an arm injury and will need complicated surgery, her mother has said.</p><p>Gadi Moses, 80, an agronomist who was kidnapped from his home in Nir Oz, a village near the Gaza border, was released on Jan. 30, appearing gaunt. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w80ZXXjk5wk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Almost as soon as he returned to Israel</a>, he pledged to do all he could to rehabilitate his ravaged community.</p><p>His niece, Efrat Machikawa, later told reporters that Mr. Moses had been kept above ground throughout his captivity but was frequently moved around.</p><p>Shut in rooms alone, she said, he exercised by counting steps and pacing up to six miles a day, kept his mind active with calculations and other techniques. And he remained positive.</p><p>When she first met him in the hospital, he reassured her, “I’m alive. I’m normal!”</p><p>“Loneliness becomes an enemy,” Ms. Machikawa said. “He managed to create a routine that kept his sanity.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
