Mr. Sampietro fired again and struck a female. Within 15 minutes, workers dressed in the tan outfits of safari guides scooped up the sleeping patients.</p><p>But they were too late: The female was already pregnant. So they injected the male with a drug designed to stop him from impregnating any more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Yes, in the wealthy suburbs of Buenos Aires, they are sterilizing the capybaras.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/15/world/00int-argentina-capybara-dispatch/00int-argentina-capybara-dispatch-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/15/world/00int-argentina-capybara-dispatch/00int-argentina-capybara-dispatch-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/15/world/00int-argentina-capybara-dispatch/00int-argentina-capybara-dispatch-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man holds a blowpipe to his mouth.

They have catapulted to the top of the unofficial adorable animal rankings via countless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdMUOsf2QNc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videos</a> showing them mellow, plump and perfectly happy to let monkeys and ducks ride on their backs. Their image adorns backpacks and stuffed animals, and in Tokyo, tourists pay premiums to feed them carrots at capybara cafes.</p><p>But to some people in one corner of their native land, the cuddly capybara has become a menace.</p><p>Since the pandemic, “carpinchos,” as they are known in Argentina, have proliferated in Nordelta, a ritzy, picturesque gated community of 45,000 people north of Buenos Aires. When residents retreated indoors in 2020, the capybaras began to colonize the manicured neighborhoods, finding green grass, fresh water and no predators, according to biologists hired by the community.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-6"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/world/americas/Capybara/Capybara-superJumbo.png" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Over the past two years, biologists estimate the capybara population has tripled to nearly 1,000 in this gated community in Argentina.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Anita Pouchard Serra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Over the past two years, the biologists estimate Nordelta’s capybara population has tripled to nearly 1,000, posing a tricky test case for the urban coexistence of humans and wildlife.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On a visit last month, capybara families grazed near the tennis courts, dozed on the volleyball courts and waded in the artificial lagoons. Just past a sign warning of crossing capybaras, a family crossed the street in a single-file line, illuminated by waiting headlights.</p><p>Sure, most residents admitted, the capybaras are cute. But they also cause traffic accidents, chomp their way through gardens and, on occasion, have attacked some of the community’s smallest dogs.</p><p>“It’s a wild animal versus a domesticated dog. I mean, it’s totally different,” said Mr. Sampietro, the veterinarian hired to help manage the capybara population. “I’ve had to do necropsies on capybaras and it’s difficult to cut the hide with a knife.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A capybara swimming in one of Nordelta’s artificial bodies of water.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group of the rodents taking a sand bath in a volleyball court.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Pablo Pefaure, one of Nordelta’s 26 neighborhood representatives, said his neighbors frequently complain to him about the amphibious rodents. “They see them as dangerous, they see them as invasive, they fear for their young children,” he said.</p><p>He said that capybaras have sometimes followed his miniature schnauzer, Grumete. “I don’t leave him alone in the garden because I don’t know what might happen,” he said.</p><p>His neighbor sitting nearby, Veronica Esposito, did not agree. “No capybara has ever approached my dogs,” she said. “Everyone says they eat the plants. Yes, they do. But the plants grow back,” she added. “I don’t see the problem.”</p><p>Ms. Esposito is one of a small group of neighbors leading a rebellion against the capybara controls. They have protested in the streets, taken legal action against developers and gathered 25,000 signatures for an online petition to protect the animals. They’ve also attracted 34,000 followers to an Instagram page where they sometimes shame their neighbors, including one who had used a whip to scare capybaras off her dock.</p><p>“I believe their adorableness is a strategy of the species itself to survive,” said Silvia Soto, the most vocal neighbor. “Their lovability have conquered us, and we’re fighting for them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Silvia Soto, member of a pro-capybara group of neighborhood residents.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-17"><div><figcaption><span>Capybara-themed merchandise, including stuffed toys, erasers and backpacks, on sale in Buenos Aires.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>So far, the fight has not worked. Last year, Argentina’s national government began an experiment to perform vasectomies on three capybaras in Nordelta, hoping to track how it affected the males’ standing in their packs. If successful, the practice could be expanded.</p><p>In February, the Nordelta organization told residents in an email that it was moving ahead with a different plan: a “contraceptive vaccination program,” approved by the local government, to sterilize 250 adult capybaras.</p><p>Costanza Falguera, the organization’s lead biologist, said her team is using a “vaccine” that halts the production of sperm and inhibits ovulation. It requires two injections several months apart, but then might last only for several months, meaning they might have to keep tranquilizing the capybaras repeatedly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>They aren’t sure how long the sterilization lasts because the drug — Improvac, made by a New Jersey drug maker, Zoetis — has not been used on capybaras. It is designed to alter pigs’ hormones before slaughter so the meat tastes better. “Only for use in male pigs,” <a href="https://www.zoetis.co.za/products/pigs/improvac.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zoetis says on its disclaimer for the drug.</a></p><p>In 2019, Nordelta sprayed its grass with the scent of a carnivore, scaring off many capybara. But Ms. Falguera said the efficacy dropped over time as the capybara in Nordelta became long removed from having regular predators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Passers-by watching a capybara eat grass on the side of a road running through Nordelta.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thirty years ago, Nordelta was largely untouched wetlands where capybaras roamed freely. It has since become home to some of Argentina’s richest people.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>So, she said, the community settled on the injections, which she said are better than castration or vasectomies because they are less likely to alter the rodents’ behavior and group dynamics.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In other words, they still mate, she said, “but they don’t fertilize.”</p><p>The decision to sterilize the capybaras ultimately rested with one of Argentina’s richest men, Eduardo Constantini, an entrepreneur and real estate developer whose company controls the Nordelta organization. His spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>To the capybara advocates, intervening in the animals’ reproduction is an escalation of Nordelta’s attack on the species.</p><p>Thirty years ago, Nordelta was largely untouched wetlands where capybaras roamed freely, hunted by pumas, jaguars, caiman and sport hunters. In the late 1990s, Mr. Constantini began transforming the area with roads, ponds, mansions, condo towers, a shopping center and a golf course designed by the American golfer Jack Nicklaus. Construction has been nearly nonstop — with 17 more buildings underway now — and it is now home to some of Argentina’s richest people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Ms. Soto argued that the capybara population is only increasing because developers destroyed the animals’ wild habitat, forcing them out of the forest and into the suburbs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“In a matter of hours they knock down a forest,” Ms. Soto said. “What happened to the wildlife? Have they died? Have they been displaced?”</p><p>Her group is pushing for the capybara to be given their own nature reserve, but there appears to be little interest from Nordelta’s developers. “I don’t understand how they can only think of vasectomy and sterilization,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group of capybaras near a tennis court at the development.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cars waiting for capybaras to cross a street in Nordelta.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>On a recent weekday, as capybara grazed on a playground, Lidia Schmidt and Felipo Contigiani walked past, hardly noticing.
