It eventually crashed in Aktau, Kazakhstan, after crossing the Caspian Sea. More than half of people on board were Azerbaijani citizens. Seven Russians and six Kazakhs died in the crash.</p><p>Of the 67 people onboard, 29 survived. </p><p>Mr. Putin said Russia had opened a criminal investigation into the crash, according to the Kremlin, and was hosting Azerbaijani investigators in Grozny. The Kremlin’s statement tried to project a united front among the three nations most affected by the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The relevant agencies of Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are closely cooperating on the site of the catastrophe,” the Kremlin statement read.</p><p>On Wednesday, the day of the crash, Russian authorities initially said that the plane had been diverted because of fog, and that birds had caused the crash. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/world/europe/azerbaijan-airlines-crash-kazakhstan-survivors.html" title="">survivors described a banging noise</a> outside the plane and fragments entering the cabin, injuring an arm of a flight attendant. </p><p>Mr. Aliyev’s more accusatory, strongly worded statement on Saturday presents the first challenge from Russia’s allies to Moscow’s attempts to control the narrative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescuers carrying a passenger wounded on Wednesday in the plane crash in Kazakhstan arrived on Thursday via a medical plane at an airport near Baku, Azerbaijan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Both Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have long tried to build economic ties to the West and shed the Russian colonial legacy — without antagonizing the Kremlin. The two former Soviet states have taken a neutral stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, benefiting from growing trade with Russia without directly supporting Kremlin’s war aims.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, the Kremlin’s apology without accepting responsibility complicates these countries’ efforts to maintain friendly relations with Russia without appearing weak to their citizens and the world, analysts said.</p><p>The Kremlin’s acceptance of responsibility is particularly important in Azerbaijan because Mr. Aliyev <a href="https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/9956199" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apologized to Mr. Putin</a> for the Azerbaijani military’s erroneous downing of a Russian military helicopter in 2020. At the time, Azerbaijan swiftly took responsibility and offered compensation for the accident, which claimed the lives of two Russian servicemen.</p><p>Mr. Aliyev most likely expected a similar response now from the Kremlin, said Zaur Shiriyev, an Azerbaijan expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a policy research organization.</p><p>Mr. Putin’s statement “is a textbook example of a non-apology apology,” Mr. Shiriyev said in an email interview. “There was no direct acceptance of responsibility, no offer of compensation, and no commitment to hold those responsible accountable.”</p><p>Neither Kazakhstan nor Azerbaijan have an incentive to allow the plane crash to sink relations with an unpredictable and militaristic neighbor, foreign policy experts said. But the Kremlin’s tardy and partial apology could breed resentment in these countries, with long-term potential consequences for Russia’s influence in the former Soviet Union, the experts added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“There aren’t that many countries that are on good terms with Russia now,” Rasim Musabayov, an Azerbaijani lawmaker, said in a phone interview on Friday. “If Moscow doesn’t make the right steps in this situation, the list might get shorter.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.

But the Kazakh government faces particular risks in provoking the Kremlin, said Luca Anceschi, a professor of Eurasian Studies at the University of Glasgow, in Scotland.</p><p>The landlocked Central Asian nation’s economy remains dependent on neighboring Russia, which ships most of its energy exports. And the Kazakhstan government’s gradual efforts to assert national language and culture in public life have drawn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrToNHwBw2o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">periodic ire from Russian ultranationalists</a>, who have called on the Kremlin to protect Russian speakers there. Mr. Putin has used similar claims to justify his invasion of Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has pursued a careful policy on neutrality, deepening economic ties to Russia and attending Mr. Putin’s summits, while <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kazakh-yurts-ukraine-irk-russia-crowdfunded-aid-pours-2023-02-02/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine</a> and refusing to recognize Russian annexation of Ukrainian land.</p><p>Kazakhstan has also benefited from the West’s sanctions on Russia after the invasion. Its exports to Russia rose 25 percent in the first year of the war, as Russian companies sought alternative channels for buying foreign goods. Azerbaijan’s total trade with Russia rose 24 percent in the same period.</p><p>Mr. Tokayev will most likely try to prevent the plane crash from upsetting this delicate neutrality before expected Ukraine-Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/trump-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">peace talks promised by President-elect Donald J. Trump</a>, who takes office in January, Professor Anceschi said. Kazakhstan’s main goal is to protect its interests in a new regional order that would emerge after the war, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Azerbaijan’s flag flying at half-staff on Thursday as the country observed day of national mourning for the victims of the crash.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aziz Karimov/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>No Russian official has commented on the growing evidence that the plane was damaged by Russian air defenses. On Friday, though, the head of Russian civil aviation authority acknowledged that a Ukrainian drone attack had forced the Grozny airport to close on the morning of the crash.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Hours after the crash, Mr. Putin spoke to journalists <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/75942" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at a summit at St. Petersburg</a>, which was attended by Mr. Tokayev of Kazakhstan. Mr. Aliyev of Azerbaijan was supposed to be there but turned his plane around in midair after learning of the crash. Mr. Putin fielded nearly a dozen innocuous questions from carefully vetted reporters without mention of the crash.</p><p>Russian state television has largely ignored the crash in news bulletins and analytical shows. Although Russian state news agencies initially focused on the bird theory and the fog, they have stopped reporting on the topic as evidence of missile damage has piled up.</p><p>Instead, <a href="https://t.me/+xxjRDBgOEsUyYzli" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pro-government journalists</a> and social media channels on Friday distributed a propaganda video clip showing Russian air defenses shooting down Santa Claus’s flying sled. “We don’t need anything foreign in our skies,” an actor playing the Russian version of Santa Claus tells an air-defense serviceman in the video.</p><p>To Alexander Baunov, a Russian political expert at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, Russia’s long initial silence weakened Mr. Putin’s attempts to present himself as a champion of developing countries against American hegemony.</p><p>“We are seeing in real time a test of the so-called multipolar world about which Moscow talks so much,” <a href="https://t.me/baunovhaus/1736" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote on the Telegram messaging app</a> on Friday. Russia’s allies will note that Mr. Putin’s policy means in practice “the right of big and powerful nations to act with impunity and arrogance against the less big and more dependent ones,” he added.</p><p>Ivan Nechepurenko<!-- --> and <!-- -->Milana Mazaeva<!-- --> contributed reporting from Tbilisi, Georgia.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anatoly Kurmanaev covers Russia and its transformation following the invasion of Ukraine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anatoly-kurmanaev">More about Anatoly Kurmanaev</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Putin Apologizes For Flight Crash<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/ilham-h-aliyev">Ilham H Aliyev</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/28/world/europe/kazakhstan-russia-azerbaijan-plane-crash.html">257</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/28/world/europe/kazakhstan-russia-azerbaijan-plane-crash.html">257</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
