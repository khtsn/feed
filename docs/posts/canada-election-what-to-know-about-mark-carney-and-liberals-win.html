That will never happen.” He also warned Canadians that confronting the American threat would be difficult and might require sacrifices.</p><h2 id="link-5c9b19f7">The result was close.</h2><p>Mr. Carney’s victory was an extraordinary political comeback for the Liberals. Just a few months ago, they trailed the opposition Conservative Party under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/canada/pierre-poilievre-conservative-leader-canada.html" title="">Pierre Poilievre</a> by nearly 30 percentage points according to opinion polls, and it was widely expected that the Liberals faced a near-death experience.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/world/canada/pierre-poilievre-conservative-party-trump.html" title="">that was before Mr. Trump</a> began talking about annexing Canada and imposing potentially crippling tariffs on the country.</p><p>It was also before Justin Trudeau, who many voters had soured on after nearly a decade in office, stepped down as prime minister.</p><p>Early in the campaign, polls started to suggest that the Conservatives’ sizable lead had evaporated and that the Liberals under Mr. Carney might be headed for a decisive win.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But during the final week or so of the campaign, the gap between the two parties narrowed as voters’ concerns shifted away from the Mr. Trump’s designs on Canada and back to concerns about the cost of living.</p><p>While the Conservatives were denied power, the party appeared headed for its biggest share of the popular vote since 1988, and it will most likely win more seats than it did in the previous Parliament.</p><h2 id="link-549ebe45">The Conservatives made gains, but their leader lost his seat.</h2><p>Mr. Poilievre lost his seat in Ottawa, a stinging defeat for a man who seemed set to become the next prime minister just a few weeks ago. He is a career politician and has held the seat for the past two decades, since he was 25.</p><p>Before news of his loss had been confirmed, Mr. Poilievre conceded the general election but vowed to stay on as leader.</p><p>He framed the Conservative result as the start of a major shift in Canadian politics, highlighting the important gains the party had made under his leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Change is needed, but is hard to come by.

Despite crediting Mr. Poilievre with lifting the Conservatives, there are segments of the party that hold him accountable for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/world/canada/trump-tariffs-muddle-campaigning-for-canadas-conservatives.html" title="">failing to successfully pivot</a> after the threat posed by Mr. Trump. Losing his seat weakens his authority, and the Conservative caucus ousted the party’s two previous leaders after election losses, but analysts expressed belief that he still had a strong grip on the party.</p><h2 id="link-698aa4f1">Carney will have to make big decisions quickly.</h2><p>After his call with Mr. Trump last month, Mr. Carney said that the U.S. president had agreed to swiftly enter broad talks on security and economic issues with whoever won Monday’s election, so a meeting between the two leaders is expected soon.</p><p>Mr. Carney will also have to quickly make a number of domestic political decisions, starting with forming a cabinet and beginning a parliamentary session.</p><p>Other experiences awaiting him include being grilled in Parliament for the first time.</p><p>And Mr. Carney will soon host the leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized nations. Mr. Trump and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, as well as the European Union, are expected to attend the summit to be held in Kananaskis, a mountain resort in Alberta, in mid-June.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div><div><p>Ian Austen reports on Canada for The Times based in Ottawa.
