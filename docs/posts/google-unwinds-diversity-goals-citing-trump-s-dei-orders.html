The email was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-kills-diversity-hiring-targets-04433d7c?mod=hp_lead_pos1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier</a> by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Like other tech giants, Google responded to a D.E.I. backlash bolstered by Mr. Trump’s election victory. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has eliminated many of its diversity teams, while Amazon has been reviewing its D.E.I. programs.</p><p>On Jan. 22, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed an executive order</a> instructing federal contractors to not engage in D.E.I., which he described as “illegal discrimination.” Through its cloud-computing arm, Google provides technology services to the federal government.</p><p>Google has also started a D.E.I. review that could result in the company’s cutting additional programs and initiatives, Ms. Cicconi said in the email.</p><p>The company will “carefully” evaluate programs, trainings and initiatives “and will update them as needed,” she said. The company will consider whether some of them “raise risk” or “aren’t as impactful as we’d hoped.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Google <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/about.google/en//belonging/diversity-annual-report/2024/static/pdfs/google_2024_diversity_annual_report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported last year</a> that 5.7 percent of its work force was Black, up from 3.7 percent in 2020. And 7.5 percent of its employees were Hispanic or Latino, compared with 5.9 percent in 2020.</p><p>After the killing of George Floyd and ensuing protests in 2020, Google was one of many companies in the United States that pledged to hire and promote more Black and Latino workers. Part of <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/commitments-racial-equity/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google’s approach</a> to improve representation was to expand its offices in cities like Atlanta and Washington.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ms. Cicconi said that the company would continue to invest in places outside California and New York, and that the company would also hire in many countries globally. She added that the company would continue to have employee resource groups in which workers from similar backgrounds can convene.</p><p>“We’ve always been committed to creating a workplace where we hire the best people wherever we operate, create an environment where everyone can thrive and treat everyone fairly,” Ms. Cicconi said. “That’s exactly what you can expect to see going forward.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nico Grant reports on Alphabet’s Google and YouTube as well as the corporate culture of Silicon Valley.
