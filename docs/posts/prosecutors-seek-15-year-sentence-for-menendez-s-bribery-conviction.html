The government asked the judge, Sidney H. Stein, to impose a sentence of at least 10 years for Mr. Hana and nine years for Mr. Daibes.</p><p>“The defendants’ crimes amount to an extraordinary attempt, at the highest levels of the legislative branch, to corrupt the nation’s core sovereign powers over foreign relations and law enforcement,” prosecutors wrote in a memo filed late Thursday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.</p><p>The three men are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 29.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Menendez’s lawyers, Avi Weitzman and Adam Fee, described a shorter recommendation made by the court’s probation office — 12 years — as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/nyregion/robert-menendez-bribery-sentencing.html" title="">death sentence</a> and urged Judge Stein to consider a far shorter prison term paired with community service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Menendez, 71, has maintained his innocence and plans to appeal the jury verdict.</p><p>The prosecutors said the substantial sentences, combined with significant financial penalties would “provide just punishment for this extraordinary abuse of power and betrayal of the public trust, and to deter others from ever engaging in similar conduct.”</p><p>“Menendez’s conduct may be the most serious for which a U.S. senator has been convicted in the history of the Republic,” the prosecutors told the judge. “Very few senators have even been convicted of any criminal offense, and of those, most of the senators engaging in bribery accepted amounts that are a fraction of what Menendez reaped, even adjusting for inflation.”</p><p>Prosecutors wrote that Mr. Menendez, a once-powerful Democrat, “collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold, a luxury automobile, and other payments in exchange for his promises to affect national security, foreign relations, and the rule of law.”</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Hana, Lawrence S. Lustberg, called the 10-year recommended sentence for his client excessive and said it was “inhumane given the nature and circumstances of the offense and Mr. Hana’s history and characteristics.”</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Menendez and Mr. Daibes had no immediate comment on the government’s recommendations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The three men were convicted in July after a two-month trial of every crime they were accused of in an 18-count indictment.</p><p>Mr. Menendez’s wife, Nadine, is charged with acting as a go-between who shuttled messages and bribes between the three men. Her trial was delayed to allow time for her to be treated for breast cancer, and it is scheduled to start a week after her husband is sentenced.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully">More about Tracey Tully</a></span></p></div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-weiser">More about Benjamin Weiser</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams’s Inner Circle: </strong>Two New Year’s Eve photos show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/eric-adams-new-years-eve.html">how much Mayor Eric Adams’s closest allies have transformed</a> after a series of scandals plunged his administration into crisis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside New York’s Migrant Shelters: </strong>A reporter and photographer spent eight months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/nyc-migrant-shelters.html">documenting life in the city’s shelter system for migrants</a>, through the eyes of those living there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Katz’s Deli’s Legal Woes: </strong>In 2011, the Zagat guide ranked the Lower East Side institution at No. 42 on its list of the city’s 50 most popular restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/nyregion/katz-deli-nyc.html">The honor would come back to bite</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Secret Weapon in the War on Rats: </strong>Katie, a 12-pound dog who’s killed nearly 500 of the pests this year, roams Brooklyn’s parks and streets in search of prey. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/katie-dog-rat-hunter.html">It’s not hard to find</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine</strong><strong>:</strong> Marina Khidekel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/marina-khidekel-hugimals.html">who founded Hugimals World</a> as an answer to her own anxiety, spends her Sundays watching “Hacks,” hanging out with other female founders and dropping in at a factory.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
