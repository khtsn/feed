    <h1>Northern Israel Braces for More Attacks From Hezbollah</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even before Hezbollah launched more than 100 rockets, cruise missiles and drones toward northern Israel on Sunday, people who lived in the area feared they would be targeted.</p><p>Most of the projectiles launched overnight were intercepted by Israel’s missile defense. But at least one struck a residential neighborhood in the town of Kiryat Bialik early Sunday morning, setting cars on fires, badly damaging a half-dozen houses, shattering windows and widening the area of the country that sees itself as under attack from Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>Roughly 45,000 people live in Kiryat Bialik, a community with tangerine trees heavy with fruit in the northern suburbs of Haifa, Israel’s third largest city. Residents there were feeling vulnerable even before Sunday’s strike as the back-and-forth attacks escalated recently between Hezbollah fighters and the Israeli military.</p><p>But, after Friday’s airstrike by Israel in southern Beirut, which killed several senior Hezbollah commanders, it seemed only a matter of time before their town was struck, said several people.</p><p>“I had a bad feeling that the next step would be rocket fire deeper than what we have seen up until now,” said Yana Klibaner, 40, a tourism adviser, who lives on the street <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/world/middleeast/hezbollah-kiryat-bialik-israel-videos.html?smid=url-share" title="">where the missile hit.</a></p><p>Ms. Klibaner lay in bed in the early hours of Sunday morning, listening as explosions came closer. She finally got up “just before the sirens sounded,” she said, and scooped up her two younger children and ran with her older daughter to the bomb shelter in their house.</p><p>“Glass shattered all around us and we felt the blast coming from the street,” she said.</p><p>Because of the warning sirens, most residents managed to reach underground shelters or safe rooms and only three people required hospital treatment, according to a spokesman for Rambam Hospital in Haifa.</p></div></div>
