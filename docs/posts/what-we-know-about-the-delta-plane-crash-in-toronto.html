At least 18 of them suffered injuries, some of them critical but not life threatening.</p><p>The authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, which occurred amid strong winds and drifting snow.</p><p>It was the latest in a spate of incidents that have rattled travelers globally, including a crash in South Korea in December that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/31/world/asia/jeju-plane-crash-maps-photos.html" title="">killed 179 people</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-dc-helicopter-reagan-airport.html" title="">fatal midair collision</a> near Washington that left 67 people dead.</p><p>Here is what to know about the crash in Toronto.</p><h2 id="link-6f0669bb">The plane’s roof became its floor.</h2><p>Pete Koukov, a professional skier from Colorado who was on Flight 4819, said that nothing seemed amiss during the plane’s final descent.</p><p>“The second that the wheels hit the ground, then everything happened,” Mr. Koukov, 28, said in an interview on Monday night. “The next thing I know, we’re sideways.”</p><p>The plane skidded on its right side, said Mr. Koukov, who was sitting at a window seat on the other side of the plane and saw flames as the plane hit the ground. It eventually ended belly side up.</p><p>“I unbuckled pretty fast and kind of lowered myself to the floor, which was the ceiling,” Mr. Koukov said. “People were panicking.”</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/fl360aero/status/1891805600838766911" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> circulating on social media on Tuesday and verified by The New York Times may offer clues about what caused the plane to tilt to its right before flipping onto its back. The video, taken from a nearby runway, shows the aircraft landing hard on a snow-covered runway and then flipping over on its right side amid black clouds of smoke. The Times has so far been unable to reach the person who took the video. </p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-1"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="delta-crash-frames-j8csi" data-id="100000009996940" data-source-id="100000009996940"><div slug="delta-crash-frames-j8csi" data-sourceid="100000009996940" id="embed-id-100000009996940">
