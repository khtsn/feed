The move came after Mr. Han refused on Thursday to appoint three judges to fill vacancies in the Constitutional Court, the body that will be deciding whether to reinstate or remove Mr. Yoon.</p><p>The political uncertainty has tormented South Korea’s economy, pushing business and consumer confidence lower and causing the currency, the won, to plunge. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The opposition has pushed for Mr. Han to sign off on nominees to fill the bench in the nation’s highest court, but Mr. Yoon’s governing party has argued that only an elected president has the power to appoint justices.</p><p>At the heart of the matter is how the court might rule on Mr. Yoon’s impeachment. Six or more justices out of the nine-member court must vote in favor of impeachment to remove Mr. Yoon from office. The top court currently has only six justices, after three others retired earlier this year, meaning that the impeachment could be overturned with just one dissenting voice in Mr. Yoon’s trial, which is scheduled to start on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Han said in a televised address that he would hold off on appointing the nominees until the rival parties — that is, Mr. Yoon’s People Power Party and the opposition bloc comprising the Democratic Party and other smaller parties — came to an agreement on whether he had the authority to do so as the acting president.</p><p>An acting president should “refrain from exercising the president’s own significant powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions,” said Mr. Han, a career bureaucrat.</p><p>Park Chan-dae, the Democratic Party’s floor leader, said to reporters that Mr. Han’s words were “not those of an acting president, but of one who is admitting to insurrection.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The opposition has accused Mr. Han of aiding Mr. Yoon in his brief declaration of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-yoon-explained.html" title="">martial law</a> on Dec. 3. Lawmakers accused Mr. Yoon of perpetrating an insurrection by sending troops into the National Assembly to block them from voting down his martial law and to detain his opponents. The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to reinstate or remove Mr. Yoon.</p><p>As for Mr. Han, the rival parties have disagreed on how many votes would be needed for him to be impeached. The ruling party maintains that a two-thirds threshold must be met since Mr. Han is the acting president. The opposition asserts that a majority vote would be enough to remove him from his office as prime minister as outlined by the Constitution. The speaker of the National Assembly, Woo Won-shik, a member of the Democratic Party, will decide before the vote.</p><p>Professor Cha Jina, a law professor at Korea University in Seoul, said that Mr. Han should be subject to a majority vote because “the acting president in South Korea is not actually the president and is just working in their stead as the prime minister.”</p><p>She also noted that this was the first time in the nation’s history that an acting president has faced impeachment.</p><p>If Mr. Han were to be impeached, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, Choi Sang-mok, would be next in line to be acting president.</p><p>On Thursday, the won, one of the weakest currencies in Asia this year, tumbled to levels against the U.S. dollar not seen since the global financial crisis in 2008. The stock market fell 1.5 percent on Thursday and is about 10 percent lower this year, a sharp contrast to many major indexes, in Asia and elsewhere, that have posted double-digit gains.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
