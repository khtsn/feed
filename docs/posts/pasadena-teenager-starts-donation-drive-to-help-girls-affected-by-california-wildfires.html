Converse sneakers were arrayed by size on the concrete floor. Clear plastic bins overflowed with deodorant, hair products and pastel pimple patches.</p><p>All of the items collected in the airy warehouse in the Boyle Heights neighborhood were free to teenagers whose homes had been incinerated in the city’s devastating wildfires.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/help-california-la-wildfires-victims.html" title="">many relief efforts for victims of the fires</a> have focused on more acute needs like shelter and food, Avery Colvert, an eighth grader in Pasadena, started a donation drive called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/altadenagirls/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Altadena Girls</a> last week with a slightly less obvious remit. She wanted to offer young women essentials they had lost, plus some of the everyday luxuries that might help restore a touch of normalcy to their lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Cristina Soltero spent more than two hours on Monday browsing with her 13-year-old niece, Mila, whose home in Altadena had been reduced to ash by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/08/weather/los-angeles-fire-maps-california.html" title="">Eaton fire</a>. The pajamas Mila had been wearing when her family evacuated were the only clothing she had left. Her budding record collection was destroyed.</p><p>“It really just demolished her spirit,” said Ms. Soltero, 41, a nurse.</p><p>While her parents searched for housing, Mila filled two Ikea bags with socks, hair ties and a Brandy Melville cardigan. She lit up when she discovered a dusty pink Stanley cup similar to the one she had left behind, her aunt said.</p><p>“It was so difficult to not cry the entire time, because she was so happy,” Ms. Soltero said. “For a minute, she was just normal, shopping, not thinking about her loss.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fourteen-year-old Avery Colvert (center, in a gray sweatshirt) lost her Altadena middle school in the Eaton fire.

Teen girl stuff. Everything from bras and underwear to makeup and stuff to just make them feel like themselves.”</p><p>The initiative quickly attracted high-profile support. Charli XCX called the organization “the coolest” on social media. Shipments of donated products arrived from Ariana Grande’s makeup brand, R.E.M. Beauty. Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a63411826/prince-harry-meghan-markle-altadena-girls-donation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a donation</a> through their charitable foundation.</p><p>Altadena Girls said it was setting up a new location in Pasadena to bring supplies closer to those affected by the wildfires. By Tuesday, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/altadenaboys/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an initiative</a> inspired by the group had popped up to support teenage boys.</p><p>Once Ashleeta Beauchamp, 35, determined she did not need to evacuate from her home in Sherman Oaks, she posted on Instagram that she was planning to make a delivery of hair care products for Black women to Altadena Girls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-7"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Ashleeta Beauchamp"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-03-tlcg/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-03-tlcg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-03-tlcg/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-03-tlcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Ashleeta Beauchamp"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-02-tlcg/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-02-tlcg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-02-tlcg/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-02-tlcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Ashleeta Beauchamp"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-01-tlcg/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-01-tlcg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-01-tlcg/15LAFIRE-TEENAGE-RECOVERY-grid-01-tlcg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Ashleeta Beauchamp, center, delivered hundreds of dollars’ worth of Black hair care products to the Boyle Heights arts studio where Altadena Girls collected and distributed goods over the weekend.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>via Ashleeta Beauchamp</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Her followers sent her around $800 to help purchase leave-in conditioner, moisturizing shampoo, bonnets, edge gel and wide-tooth combs.
