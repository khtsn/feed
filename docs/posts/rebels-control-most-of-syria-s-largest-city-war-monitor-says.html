    <h1>Rebels Control Most of Syria’s Largest City, War Monitor Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Antigovernment rebels captured most of Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, by early Saturday, facing little resistance from government forces on the ground there, according to the fighters and to <a href="https://www.syriahr.com/en/350199/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a war monitoring group</a>.</p><p>Syrian government warplanes responded with airstrikes on Aleppo neighborhoods for the first time since 2016, according to the war monitoring group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/world/middleeast/the-man-behind-the-casualty-figures-in-syria.html" title="">the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a>. That year, rebels were routed from Aleppo in a fierce battle for the city that dragged on for months, a big blow to the opposition movement trying to oust the autocratic president, Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday that Russia had carried out airstrikes against the rebel offensive in support of the Syrian military, but it did not say where. The observatory said that the Russian strikes had hit opposition-held areas of two provinces, Aleppo and Idlib. It was not immediately clear whether Russia had struck the city of Aleppo, capital of the Aleppo province.</p><p>The rapid advance on Aleppo came just four days into a surprise rebel offensive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html" title="">launched on Wednesday</a>. It is both the most serious challenge to Mr. al-Assad’s regime and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war.html" title="">the most intense escalation</a> in years in a long civil war that had been mostly dormant.</p></div></div>
