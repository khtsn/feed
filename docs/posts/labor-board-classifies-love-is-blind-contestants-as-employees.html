It is one of the labor board’s first forays into reality television and a major development in the effort by some onscreen personalities to change the industry through the legal system.</p><p>Several contestants on “Love Is Blind,” which streams on Netflix and has been one of the buzziest dating shows since its debut in 2020, have come forward in lawsuits, in interviews and on social media with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/arts/reality-tv-lawsuits.html" title="">objections to the restrictions outlined in their contracts</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>One contestant, Renee Poche, became involved in a legal dispute with the show after she publicly accused the production of allowing her to become engaged, in front of TV cameras, to a man “who was unemployed with a negative balance in his bank account.” She said in court papers that after she had made “limited public remarks about her distressing time on the program,” one of the companies behind the production initiated arbitration proceedings against her, accusing her of violating her nondisclosure agreement and seeking $4 million. (Poche, a veterinarian who lives in Texas, said she had earned a stipend of $1,000 per week, adding up to a total of $8,000.)</p><p>Two “Love Is Blind” participants — Poche and Nick Thompson — submitted complaints to the labor board, resulting in an investigation into the policies and practices of the production companies behind the show, which include Kinetic Content and Delirium TV.</p><p>A lawyer representing the production companies declined to comment. Representatives for Netflix, which streams the show but is not listed in the complaint, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/arts/television/love-is-blind-netflix-reality-show.html" title="">“Love Is Blind” season features 30 singles</a> who date one another from separate rooms known as “pods.” Their conversations are fed through speakers, and they do not see whom they are talking with unless they decide to become engaged — a commitment that also comes with a wedding where they can say “I do” or walk away.</p><p>The production companies have long defended their treatment of the cast members, arguing that every decision the contestants make is up to them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We document the independent choices of adults who volunteer to participate in a social experiment,” the show’s creator, Chris Coelen, <a href="https://people.com/love-is-blind-creator-speaks-out-season-5-participant-tran-dang-sues-sexual-assault-lawsuit-exclusive-8348174" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement to People magazine</a> amid complaints last year. “Their journey is not scripted, nor is it filmed around the clock. We have no knowledge or control over what occurs in private living spaces when not filming, and participants may choose to end their journey at any time.”</p><p>In defending themselves against legal actions, the companies have asserted that the show’s participants are not employees. The labor board’s complaint demands that the show reclassify its participants as employees and rescind what it calls unlawful contractual provisions.</p><p>Complaints are issued after a labor board regional office concludes that there is merit to accusations that have been made against an employer. They are then litigated before an administrative law judge, who will determine whether the employer has violated the law. The employers could appeal a decision to the national labor board in Washington.</p><p>In a statement, Bryan Freedman, a lawyer representing Poche and several other reality television litigants outside “Love Is Blind,” said in a statement on Wednesday that he thought the labor complaint had the potential to transform the industry.</p><p>“Cast members are stripped of fundamental rights, gagged from speaking out, denied legal recourse, paid virtually nothing, subjected to the ever-present threat of ruinous liquidated damages and prevented from working elsewhere,” he said. “These practices must stop.”</p><p>In the world of reality television, where wild onscreen behavior is often rewarded with higher ratings, production companies have long sought to reduce their exposure to litigation with tightly written contracts laden with confidentiality provisions and other restrictions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The complaint by the National Labor Relations Board outlines provisions in “Love Is Blind” contracts that it deems unlawful.</p><p>One is a noncompete provision that says cast members cannot give interviews or make news media appearances on their “own behalf or for any third party” for one year after their last episode airs.</p><p>Another is a contractual term saying that if a contestant wishes to leave the show and the production deems that person’s reasoning not “legitimate,” the contestant would be subject to a $50,000 fine. Coelen said <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/love-is-blind-lawsuit-allegations-danielle-ruhl-interview-1235734836/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview with Variety</a> last year that the penalty had never been enforced, describing it as a “clause that goes back to the earliest days of unscripted television.”</p><p>The complaint seeks to make the production companies pay former cast members for any wages they lost by agreeing to those provisions.</p><p>Thompson, a cast member from the show’s second season, began criticizing “Love Is Blind” publicly more than a year after Netflix aired the episodes about his courtship with and marriage to another contestant, Danielle Ruhl. In <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/love-is-blind-nick-thompson-show-was-like-cult-2023-6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news interviews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBedA5GpREE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on his own podcast</a>, Thompson described the emotional turmoil of being a participant on the show, long filming hours and what he viewed as manipulated conflict with Ruhl. The couple are now separated.</p><p>“Reality TV has escaped labor laws,” he said on his podcast last year. “Reality TV has escaped any kind of regulation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The labor complaint, which was signed by Jennifer A. Hadsall, the regional director in Minneapolis, noted that Thompson had received a letter from the production that accused him of making “escalating falsehoods” and threatened legal action over what the board deemed protected employee activity.</p><p>The labor dispute throws into question part of the formula for a series that has become a reliable success for Netflix, generating spinoffs and international editions. Its eighth season — with contestants from Minneapolis — is scheduled to start streaming in February.</p><p>This year, Netflix and the production companies behind “Love Is Blind” agreed to a $1.4 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by a former participant, Jeremy Hartwell. His lawyers calculated that people featured on the show were paid about seven dollars an hour, less than half of the minimum wage in California, where part of the show is filmed. The settlement, which did not include any admission from the production companies that the contestants qualified as employees, is subject to court approval.</p><p>Allyson L. Belovin, a labor lawyer, said that because leadership of the labor board changes with presidential administrations, there was uncertainty over whether the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump would take a different stance on the case.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
