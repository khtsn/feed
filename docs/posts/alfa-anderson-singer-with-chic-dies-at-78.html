She was 78.</p><p>The death was confirmed by Ms. Anderson’s publicist, Tonya Hawley, who did not cite a cause or say when or where she died.</p><p>Ms. Anderson’s voice became a constant presence in the disco era from her work with the band Chic and other prominent artists, including Sister Sledge, Diana Ross and Mick Jagger.</p><p>Her musical career blossomed after she moved from Augusta, Ga., to New York, where she studied education and became a teacher, marking up homework and leading classes while performing with bands around the city.</p><p>She was eventually introduced to Luther Vandross, who invited her to a Chic vocal session, shortly after the disco band was formed by the guitarist Nile Rodgers and bassist Bernard Edwards. Ms. Anderson sang as a background vocalist on Chic’s debut album, before becoming a co-lead vocalist with Luci Martin from 1978 to 1983.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Her voice can be heard on some of the band’s best-known hits, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLTDpewIpfw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Good Times.”</a> She sang solo on “At Last I Am Free,” and “I Want Your Love.”</p><p>In 2013, she <a href="https://www.popmatters.com/176317-at-last-she-is-free-an-interview-with-alfa-anderson-2495710232.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Pop Matters</a> that “I Want Your Love” was still a song she enjoyed decades later.</p><p>“It made me feel like I was really an integral part of the group, not just a background singer,” she said. “It actually forced me to throw off my Southern Baptist roots and not be so shy about expressing my sensuality or sexuality.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
