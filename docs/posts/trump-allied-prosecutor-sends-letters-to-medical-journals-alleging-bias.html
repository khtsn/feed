He has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/martin-caputo-prosecutor-confirmation.html" title="">criticized for using his office</a> to target opponents of President Trump.</p><p>Some scientists and doctors said they viewed the letters as a threat from the Trump administration that could have a chilling effect on what journals publish. The health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said he wants to prosecute medical journals, accusing them of lying to the public and colluding with pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>One of the letters was sent to the journal <a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chest</a>, published by the American College of Chest Physicians. The New York Times obtained a copy of the letter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Times confirmed that at least two other publishers had received nearly identically worded letters, but those publishers would not speak publicly because they feared retribution from the Trump administration.</p><p>In the letter to Chest, dated Monday, Mr. Martin wrote, “It has been brought to my attention that more and more journals and publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.”</p><p>He demanded that the journal’s publishers answer a series of questions by May 2. Do they accept submissions from “competing viewpoints?” What do they do if the authors they published “may have misled their readers?” Are they transparent about influence from “supporters, funders, advertisers and others?”</p><p>And he specifically singled out the National Institutes of Health, which funds some of the research the journals publish, asking about the agency’s role “in the development of submitted articles.”</p><p>The prosecutor’s inquiry amounts to “blatant political intimidation of our medical journals,” Dr. Adam Gaffney, a pulmonologist and researcher in Massachusetts whose articles have been published in Chest, <a href="https://x.com/awgaffney/status/1912963517931479119" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was not clear how many journals had been targeted. Several prominent medical and science publishers said they had not received letters. Others declined requests for comment. News of the letters was <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/115180" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier reported</a> by MedPage Today, a medical news website.</p><p>The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington also declined to comment. Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, declined to comment on whether Mr. Kennedy had any involvement.</p><p>Laura DiMasi, a spokeswoman for the American College of Chest Physicians, confirmed that the organization had received the letter but declined an interview request.</p><p>Most of what medical journals publish is highly technical, aimed at an audience of specialists. But they and the organizations that publish them have increasingly come under attack. Right-leaning sites like Breitbart have derided them as “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/08/doge-considering-cuts-to-woke-medical-journals/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">woke medical journals</a>.”</p><p>The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, has been attacking the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which publishes a journal and runs a variety of reproductive health programs. It has <a href="https://www.acog.org/practice-management/patient-safety-and-quality/partnerships/alliance-for-innovation-on-maternal-health-aim" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received federal funding</a> for an effort to promote maternal health. The alliance recently <a href="https://adflegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/adf-letter-acog-hhs-funding-2025-04-10.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged the Trump administration</a> to cut funding and investigate the group, saying it was pushing liberal ideas about diversity and gender.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Several journals or their publishers have publicly opposed Mr. Trump.</p><p>In January, the American Public Health Association, which publishes a journal, was among several groups that <a href="https://www.apha.org/getcontentasset/00f11f9a-f793-4a09-ab0c-60c1c82c6719/7ca0dc9d-611d-46e2-9fd3-26a4c03ddcbb/250128_omb-memo_complaint_filed.pdf?language=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued the Trump administration</a> over a memo freezing federal funding. That policy that has now been rescinded, though the administration has since halted other funds.</p><p>In March, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called mass layoffs at H.H.S. an “<a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/03/acog-hhs-staff-are-critical-to-the-well-being-of-our-entire-population" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attack on public health</a>.”</p><p>In 2020, The New England Journal of Medicine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/health/new-england-journal-trump.html" title="">published an editorial</a> condemning Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic — the first time the journal had taken a position in an election in its 208-year history. The journal Nature endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president in the 2020 election and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03417-y" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke out against a second Trump term</a> during the 2024 election.</p><p>Medical journals are afforded the same First Amendment protections as any other news media outlet.</p><p>Kent Anderson, a consultant for scientific publishers who has written about conservative attacks on medical journals, said that Mr. Martin’s inquiry could have a chilling effect among publishers.</p><p>“This is a fishing expedition from a U.S. attorney, and that makes people nervous,” Mr. Anderson said. “It may make them think twice about an editorial about treating women who have a spontaneous abortion or about transgender teens dealing with a health issue, because it may make them think that somebody is going to knock on the door.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy had been nursing grievances about scientific journals for years. Medical and science publishers have long rejected article submissions that purport to show a link between vaccines and autism. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/health/what-causes-autism.html" title="">Dozens of studies have failed to establish</a> such a link.)</p><p>He said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQedKOpJM-0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a podcast interview last year</a> that he would seek to prosecute medical journals under the federal anti-corruption statute.</p><p>“I’m going to litigate against you under the racketeering laws, under the general tort laws,” he said. “I’m going to find a way to sue you unless you come up with a plan right now to show how you’re going to start publishing real science and stop retracting the real science and publishing the fake pharmaceutical science by these phony industry mercenaries.”</p><p>As examples, he pointed to two prominent journals, The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet, and the scientific publishing giant, Elsevier.</p><p>Other top health officials in the Trump administration have also criticized the big scientific publishers. In a book published last year, Dr. Martin A. Makary, the new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, <a href="https://www.martymd.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused journal editorial boards of “gate-keeping”</a> and publishing only information that supports a “groupthink narrative.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Before becoming director of the N.I.H., Dr. Jay Bhattacharya <a href="https://x.com/DrJBhattacharya/status/1770549549096169882" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly chastised</a> the editor in chief of a prominent journal, Science, claiming he had “publicly denigrated scientists” who opposed Covid-era lockdowns. Dr. Bhattacharya was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/health/coronavirus-great-barrington.html" title="">widely</a> denounced by mainstream scientists during the pandemic for proposing that the virus should allowed to spread naturally through the population.</p><p>Dr. Bhattacharya also <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/new-journal-co-founded-nih-nominee-raises-eyebrows-misinformation-fears" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">co-founded a new journal</a> pitched as an alternative to traditional scientific publishing.
