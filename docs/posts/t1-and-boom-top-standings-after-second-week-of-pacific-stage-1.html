</span> had the most dominant opening two matches of any team in Pacific.</p>

<p>The results from week two of league play were:</p>



<p>After both suffering defeats in their opening victories, ZETA and Team Secret both entered their second-week clash searching for a bounce-back. A loss to either team would have put them at the bottom of the Group Omega table, and a strong performance from <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2615/clz">
		CLZ	</a>
</span> ensured ZETA would not. Despite Team Secret&#39;s <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/8504/invy">
		invy	</a>
</span> recording match-highs in rating and kills, there was too much weight for him to carry, as ZETA would go on to win 2-0. In a clash between one of the region&#39;s fastest-rising teams and its top dog, T1 and Nongshim fought out a tight two-map series. Nongshim moved away from Duelist <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/31827/dambi">
		Dambi	</a>
</span>&#39;s trademark Neon, and ultimately paid the price, falling 2-0 and by a margin of just five rounds.</p>

<p>Paper Rex and Gen.G, the champions of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2002/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Split 1</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Split 2</a> last year, respectively, both lost their opening matches of league play and collided head-on, with the loser falling to 0-2 to start the year. While the first map was a close 13-10 on Gen.G&#39;s pick of Lotus, Paper Rex appeared to seize some momentum with a 13-6 win on Fracture. That set up for the all-decisive third map, which saw Gen.G dominate 13-4 off the back of a dominant performance from <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/34974/karon">
		Karon	</a>
</span>. Paper Rex, seemingly still figuring things out, will have to wait at least another week until their first win.</p>


<p><em>Gen.G&#39;s in-game leader <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/2489/munchkin">
		Munchkin	</a>
</span> had not one, but two 4Ks on attack, including a 1v4 clutch.</em></p>

<p>In a pair of dominant wins, DRX swept DFM, and RRQ did the same to TALON. DRX gave up just 11 rounds in total, while RRQ allowed 13. All-around domination saw the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff/main-event" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> winners remain undefeated in Pacific play in 2025, while the new-look RRQ made their case as one of the top Southeast Asian teams.</p>

<p>However, it was a different Southeast Asian team that declared themselves the strongest. BOOM proved that their opening <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/458809/gen-g-vs-boom-esports-champions-tour-2025-pacific-stage-1-w1" target="_blank">2-0 victory over Gen.G</a> was not a fluke. In a Group Alpha clash to stay undefeated, the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2146/champions-tour-2024-pacific-ascension" target="_blank">Pacific Ascension</a> runner-ups-turned VCT team dominated Global Esports. Both teams finished Kickoff ranked 9th-12th, but when matched up head-to-head, that seemed anything but the case. BOOM won Global&#39;s map pick of Lotus 13-1, redefining what it means to steal an opponent&#39;s map. The dominant 11-1 half came when BOOM was on defense, and a similar fate befell Global on Haven. BOOM entered halftime after winning eight defending rounds and despite some heroics from the likes of <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4428/udotan">
		UdoTan	</a>
</span>, it was too little too late for GE, who fell 13-11.</p>

<p>At 2-0, BOOM holds the top position in Group Alpha, also possessing the advantage in round differential over DRX. Meanwhile, T1 leads Group Omega as the only undefeated team remaining in the group.</p>
