They also lay hidden for centuries on the grounds of America’s presidential homes, including Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello.</p><p>Now, a burial ground for enslaved people has been discovered at Andrew Jackson’s home in Nashville, known as the Hermitage, the Andrew Jackson Foundation <a href="https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2967/jackson_foundation_rel_final_-_dec_10docx.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced this week</a>. The brash and divisive seventh U.S. president, whose portrait <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/president-trump-white-house.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0" title="">hung</a> in the Oval Office during President-elect Donald J. Trump’s first term, was known to have owned, along with his son, more than 300 enslaved people before the Civil War.</p><p>Historians at the foundation established that at least two dozen of those people had died at the 1,120-acre Hermitage in Nashville, but finding their graves, despite many attempts, proved elusive. Even as the foundation began to focus on the role of enslaved people at the plantation, and a clearer picture emerged of their lives, the graves themselves could not be found.</p><p>“This was really the one glaring missing thing,” said Tony Guzzi, the chief of preservation for the foundation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That changed in January, when archaeologists found 28 graves — roughly the same number as that of enslaved people known by the foundation to have died at the Hermitage, Mr. Guzzi said. There may be more such graves in that same area, or elsewhere, that are yet to be located, he added.</p><p>“Any time you have this large of a population of enslaved people at the site, there has to be a cemetery somewhere,” Mr. Guzzi said. “And we have found that piece of the history that was missing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tony Guzzi, the chief of preservation at the Hermitage, near the burial ground.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">George Walker IV/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The discovery came after a donor came forward, seeking to help the foundation tell a more complete story of slavery, as Monticello and George Washington’s Mount Vernon had done, Mr. Guzzi said. The donor, who Mr. Guzzi said did not wish to be named, gave the foundation the money to look for a burial ground.</p><p>The main clue was an offhand mention in an agricultural report from 1935. The document referred to a specific area near a creek that contained graves, and would not, therefore, be suited to farming.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Using old maps and aerial photographs, a research team was able to single out a five-acre “search area.” After clearing thick overgrowth, the team found telltale depressions in rows on the ground, Mr. Guzzi said, and some limestone slabs, placed vertically. “In nature, you would never find a piece of limestone set like that<em>,” </em>he said.</p><p>Using ground-penetrating radar technology, archaeologists from Vanderbilt Institute of Spatial Research and TRC Environmental Corporation detected the presence of 28 graves underground — “six feet by two feet” — most likely belonging to adults. Some may have been buried in caskets, said Mr. Guzzi. “More likely they were just buried in some sort of shroud,” he said.</p><p>The burial ground lay about 1,000 feet from both the Jackson home and the enslaved peoples’ quarters.</p><p>The discovery adds the Hermitage to the list of other presidential sites — <a href="https://www.monticello.org/visit/tips-for-visiting/burial-ground-for-enslaved-people/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monticello</a>, <a href="https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/enslaved-burial-ground" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mount Vernon</a>, James Madison’s <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=24120" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Montpelier</a> — where visitors can now see, in addition to lavish homes and gardens, the burial grounds of enslaved people who worked the land and tended to the presidents’ homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>A burial ground makes the story of slavery more concrete, said Mr. Guzzi. “We tell you about slavery, we have exhibits about slavery, we have tours that talk about slavery. But it’s all kind of in the abstract,” he said. “This is the one place, I think, where people can have a tangible connection — you’re there where enslaved people are buried. That’s real.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An aerial view of the burial site containing 28 graves of enslaved people.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alan LeBlanc</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A reckoning with the legacy of slavery at presidential sites may have begun at Monticello. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/us/daniel-p-jordan-dead.html" title="">The longtime president</a> of the foundation that owns the site commissioned a study in the 1990s that established that Jefferson had almost certainly fathered six children with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/sally-hemings-exhibit-monticello.html" title="">Sally Hemings</a>, one of hundreds of people he had enslaved.</p><p>That paved the way for Monticello and other sites to begin formally acknowledging — and memorializing — the people who were enslaved by the country’s presidents, including by finding and marking their graves.</p><p>Richard Blackett, the Andrew Jackson professor emeritus of history at Vanderbilt University, said that when he first visited the Hermitage more than two decades ago, a film that played there scarcely mentioned slavery. Later, he said, the Hermitage got “very active” in trying to understand the role it played.</p><p>When it came to finding the graves of enslaved people, he added: “The Hermitage is running fast to catch up” with other presidential sites. “This new development — we can’t turn up our noses at it, it’s significant — but it’s long overdue.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Burial grounds continue to be discovered elsewhere in the South — at universities, in public parks and backyards, amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/27/us/louisiana-graves-enslaved-people.html" title="">petrochemical plants</a>.</p><p>They are a lingering reminder not only of the existence of enslaved people, but of how even in death, they were denied a place in the historical record, according to Joanna Gilmore, an anthropologist who teaches at the College of Charleston and is part of a <a href="https://www.asabgproject.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">project</a> seeking to link descendants to their enslaved relatives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/us/politics/charleston-nc-slavery-black-history-dna.html" title="">using DNA</a> from burial grounds.</p><p>Time can erase these sites, Ms. Gilmore said. Wooden crosses decay and disappear; sometimes stone markers are removed. “There’s definitely a sort of deliberate forgetting of these sites on the part of landowners — in the past, certainly,” she said, noting what she called a need for federal protection for the sites.</p><p>At the Hermitage, a committee including descendants of enslaved people will decide how the burial ground will be memorialized and whether more forensic analysis of the graves will be carried out. For now, visitors can go see the graves, albeit through a fence and from a distance.</p><p>Each grave possesses a stone marker corresponding to where the archaeologists found remains in the ground below. Nearby stands a sign with the names of the people known to have died at the Hermitage while enslaved. “Those are the ones we know of who died here,” Mr. Guzzi said. “And so we list those names, so that people can read them<em>.”</em></p></div></div></section></article></div>
