But what some might have viewed as a lack of planning was, actually, the plan all along.</p><p>After all, when you choose to get married in Antarctica onboard a ship whose schedule is bound to the ever-changing January weather, you must be prepared to expect the unexpected — last-minute penguin viewings included.</p><p>“This connected right into our adventurous and spontaneous spirit when it comes to travel and our lives together,” Mr. Sun said.</p><p>When Mr. Sun and Ms. Liu, both 26, first met as freshmen at the University of Texas at Austin nine years ago, neither thought they would end up exploring the world together — or even end up dating at all. At the dorm hangout during which they initially crossed paths, Ms. Liu had arrived intending to be a wing woman for her roommate, who liked a boy who was hanging out with Mr. Sun.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Sun, on the other hand, quickly developed a crush on Ms. Liu and confessed his interest to her best friend, who, naturally, told her. But, Mr. Sun’s “feelings weren’t reciprocated,” and Ms. Liu told him as much to not “lead him on,” she said.</p><p>However, when Mr. Sun headed to Argentina that summer to study for a semester, the duo kept in touch frequently via text and Snapchat. After a pivotal night of “a few too many fernet con colas,” Mr. Sun found the courage to ask Ms. Liu out on a post-trip date.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Liu, the father of the bride, had to become an official British Antarctic Territory Marriage Officer — a daunting process that included a thorough application and a hefty fee.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keith Thompson/Quark Expeditions</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That date, which took place a few weeks later in September 2017, dinner at the Hopdoddy Burger Bar in Austin, was a success. The duo began dating, but those early years were not without their challenges. The transition from friendship to romance proved difficult for both parties — “Our relationship was as slow a start as any,” said Ms. Liu — and she admitted that Mr. Sun did “a lot of the heavy lifting” when it came to keeping their bond strong.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/vows" title=""><em>Binge more Vows columns here</em></a></strong><strong><em> and </em></strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion/weddings" title=""><em>read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here</em></a></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>In their vows many years later, both agreed that it “was no fairy tale beginning,” said Ms. Liu, but rather a love story that grew and deepened over time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Things ramped up after graduation when the couple moved to Boston in the summer of 2020 so Ms. Liu could begin law school at Harvard. When she wasn’t studying, she and Mr. Sun spent the first years of the pandemic bonding in their studio apartment. They passed the time eating ice cream, a shared favorite dessert, and watching travel YouTubers “talking about the adventures we also wanted to go on together,” Mr. Sun said.</p><p>Over the next few years, the lifelong travel fans made good on their dream, completing adventures across six continents, including the “bucket list experience,” as Mr. Sun put it, of hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in 2022. A year later, on a trip to Portugal to celebrate his birthday and Ms. Liu’s final semester of law school, Mr. Sun proposed.</p><p>Mr. Sun, who grew up in the Dallas suburbs, has a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and in business administration in business honors and quantitative finance from the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. He currently works remotely as an engagement manager at the consulting firm Monevate, which is based in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.</p><p>Ms. Liu, who also grew up in suburban Dallas, has a bachelor’s degree in rhetoric and writing and a law degree from Harvard. She is a litigation associate in the Washington, D.C., office of Kirkland &amp; Ellis.</p><p>When it came to a wedding location, the couple, who now live in Washington, “wanted to do something that was a bit out of the ordinary,” Mr. Sun said. At the time, they’d traveled to five continents, with plans to visit Australia the following summer. As the final continent left to cross off, Antarctica immediately came to mind, but they weren’t sure if, legally, marrying there was actually feasible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The couple forgot to exchange rings at the “altar” — but found time to later.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keith Thompson/Quark Expeditions</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Liu’s older sister baked sugar cookies featuring the family’s beloved senior dog, Teddy.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The day after their wedding, the couple was walking along the shore at Neko Harbour when they came across a penguin. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mei Hong Wu</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Never one to back down from a challenge — he once took a two-and-a-half-hour bus ride to nab a slice of Ms. Liu’s favorite vegan cheesecake as a surprise — Mr. Sun spent weeks doing research, discovering they could gain a marriage license through Britain, the only country to offer an Antarctic option. Once he found Quark Expeditions, a polar expedition company that offered an 11-day voyage of the continent, he and Ms. Liu locked it in.</p><p>Booking the trip was the easiest part of their planning. Ms. Liu’s father, James Liu, was an ordained officiant in the United States, but needed to become an official British Antarctic Territory Marriage Officer to legally perform the marriage — a daunting process that included a thorough application listing the potential officiant’s qualifications and reasons for performing the ceremony, plus a hefty fee.</p><p>Then, there was the matter of planning the events. Although they couldn’t finalize the schedule because of the unstable Antarctic weather, the couple worked with the guest services team at Quark Expeditions to set up photography and a post-ceremony meal. It would be summer during their voyage in the southern hemisphere, but it was still Antarctica, so Ms. Liu and Mr. Sun (along with their parents, all four of whom were present) stocked up on parkas and ski pants.</p><p>On Jan. 22, the ship departed from Ushuaia, Argentina, and docked four days later near Portal Point on Antarctica’s west coast. As their fellow shipmates explored the peninsula (there were 172 passengers onboard), Mr. Sun and Ms. Liu, with the help of Quark Expeditions’ guest services director and photographer, chose an ice dome featuring a backdrop of glaciers and icebergs as their wedding location. “It just felt right to us,” Ms. Liu said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Around 5 p.m., the couple and their parents, all of whom received “nature’s blowout with a side of hat hair” from the weather, said Ms. Liu, converged for the ceremony. Mr. Liu opened with a speech celebrating the “majestic and wondrous” locale and stating the declarations required to solemnize the marriage within the British Antarctic Territory.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Liu’s father, the officiant, used Mr. Sun’s back to sign documents.

Mr. Sun praised Ms. Liu’s ability to “appreciate the little things” and joked about their literal “cold feet,” while Ms. Liu noted the groom’s “endless curiosity” and steady presence.</p><p>Mr. Sun, she read, felt like “home, no matter where in the world we are — whether it’s in a 300 square foot studio in Boston, a tent 5,000 feet high on the Inca Trail, or a cabin on a ship making its way through the Drake Passage.”</p><p>In the excitement of the occasion, the duo forgot to exchange rings at the “altar.” They paused their celebrations to do so, while the Quark Expeditions employees, acting as witnesses, signed their certificates — using each other’s backs to write on since the only hard surfaces were rock or ice.</p><p>Back on the ship, the newlyweds excitedly encountered a rare sighting of an emperor penguin before gathering in a private room for dinner. Both sets of parents gave speeches as they all feasted on a meal fittingly heavy on seafood, not to mention alcohol. (“Our memory is not super sharp — we are attributing that to the free-flowing wine and champagne,” Ms. Liu joked.)</p><p>During dinner, humpback whales were spotted out the window, and the couple were delighted to find the expedition company had unexpectedly baked a two-tier wedding cake and decorated their room. “It’s hard to describe in words how incredible this was,” Mr. Sun said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-16"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The next day, the couple took a “polar plunge” into the icy waters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keith Thompson/Quark Expeditions</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After her plunge, Ms. Liu’s veil was briefly swept away.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keith Thompson/Quark Expeditions</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The next day, the couple continued celebrating with a “polar plunge” into the icy Antarctic waters, during which Ms. Liu’s veil was briefly swept away.</p><p>Although the ship docked in Argentina on Feb. 1, the duo kept the party going by traveling to the city of Mendoza, where they explored wine country before holding a second (and much warmer) vow exchange with 26 guests on Feb. 5.</p><p>As for their next adventure, no one’s rushing to figure out the plans. As Ms. Liu told Mr. Sun during their ceremony, their “journey of a lifetime” is just beginning.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-52899010"><span>On This Day</span></h3><p><strong>When</strong> Jan. 26, 2025</p><p><strong>Where</strong> On Portal Point, Antarctica</p><p><strong>Dog-Themed Cookies </strong>Although<strong> </strong>Ms. Liu’s older sister Jessica couldn’t join the voyage, she baked sugar cookies featuring illustrations of the family’s beloved senior dog, Teddy, for the wedding guests (and ship crew) to enjoy after dinner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Good Luck Snow </strong>During the middle of the dinner, it began to snow, which the couple took as a good omen. Ms. Liu said, “If rain on your wedding day means good luck, then snow must be even luckier, right?” Just a day later, the ship encountered “true Antarctic weather” with large waves and icy winds, making the couple appreciate their ceremony’s fortuitous timing.</p><p><strong>An Unexpected Keepsake </strong>Near the end of the voyage, Quark Expeditions held an auction benefiting Penguin Watch, a research organization monitoring penguin numbers and behaviors. Ms. Liu and Mr. Sun hadn’t intended to participate, but when they saw a map of Antarctica decorated by their expedition guide up for sale, they couldn’t resist. “We knew that would be a beautiful way to commemorate the end of our trip,” Ms. Liu said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-20"></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Feb. 7, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misidentified the city in Texas where Eric Sun and Jennifer Liu grew up.
