The party was wiped out in local contests during Barack Obama’s presidency, and then Republicans drew legislative districts to their own advantage after the 2010 census and reapportionment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since then, Democrats have sought to direct more money to state-level races. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/us/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-protasiewicz.html" title="">more than $40 million</a> was spent on an election for a single seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</p><p>The most expensive nonpresidential races in 2024 will be the contests that determine control of the Senate — elections in Arizona, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — but many millions more will be directed toward competitive House districts.</p><p>The party’s state legislative campaign arm intends to spend $10 million on key races, a fraction of Democratic investment in just one of the most competitive Senate contests. There are few expensive races for governor this year beyond the election to replace Gov. Roy Cooper, Democrat of North Carolina.</p><p>“The vice president believes that this race is about mobilizing the entire country, in races at every level, to fight for our freedoms and our economic opportunity,” said Jen O’Malley Dillon, Ms. Harris’s campaign chair. “Democrats win when we fight together.”</p><p>Ms. Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, was until last month the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Harris campaign has been swimming in cash since the vice president replaced President Biden as the party’s presidential nominee. It said it raised $82 million during the week of the Democratic National Convention, and $540 million over the first month Ms. Harris was a candidate.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
