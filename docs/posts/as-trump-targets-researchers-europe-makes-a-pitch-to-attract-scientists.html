That has created strains but also a sense of opportunity on the continent, where attracting the best scientific minds to vigorous and independent universities is seen as part of a broader campaign to “rearm” Europe as an independent power.</p><p>Over the longer term, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, plans to double grants for researchers who relocate and to enshrine freedom of scientific research into a law called the European Research Area Act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The first priority is to ensure that science in Europe remains open and free. That is our calling card,” Ms. von der Leyen said. </p><p>The Trump administration’s attack on science and threats to universities were the main impetus for the conference, which was attended by government ministers and prominent researchers from across Europe. Increasingly, the United States is seen as a strategic adversary, and opening doors to American researchers and scientists is viewed as a long-term response to that challenge.</p><p>Mr. Macron’s message to scientists was this: “If you love freedom, come help us to remain free.”</p><p>France announced its own program to lure U.S.-based researchers last month. The government promised universities and research institutions in the country up to 50 percent of the funding needed to lure international researchers, including those working in areas under pressure from the Trump administration like climate studies and low carbon energy. But no particular funding was announced until Monday, when Mr. Macron said his government would commit $113 million to the program.<span>    </span></p><p>Alarms in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/europe-trump-science-research.html" title="">Europe began sounding</a> when the Trump administration slashed jobs and froze science grants at leading American institutions as part of cost-cutting measures. European dismay increased when the U.S. government attacked diversity programs and attempted to dictate to universities “whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">the words of Harvard’s president</a>, Alan M. Garber.</p><p>Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its $2.2 billion federal funding freeze. Mr. Trump mused last week about ending Harvard’s tax-exempt status.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The U.S. government has also fired staff at U.S. centers deemed to be at the pinnacle of scientific research, including at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/climate/noaa-trump-staff-cuts.html" title="">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/climate/trump-nsf-cuts-antarctica.html" title="">National Science Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/fda-cdc-health-department-trump.html" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research.</p><p>At the same time, some federal agencies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html" title="">removed word</a>s from websites and grant applications that were deemed unacceptable to the Trump administration. Among the terms considered taboo are “climate science,” “diversity” and “gender.”</p><p>Taken together, the actions have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/climate/trump-science-funding-cuts.html" title="">sent a chill through academia and research institutes</a>, with scientists worried not just for their jobs but the long-term viability of their research.</p><p>“In the United States, once a paradise for researchers, academic freedom is being challenged. The line between truth and falsehood, between fact and belief, is being weakened,” Elisabeth Borne, France’s education minister, said Monday as she opened the conference. </p><p>Universities in France <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/europe-trump-science-research.html" title="">have been at the forefront</a> of attempts to benefit from a potential American brain drain.

Since then, many other universities and institutions have followed suit. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Our self-interest, as well as our values, now command us to be the refuge for knowledge wherever it is under pressure,” said Luis Vassy, the president of Sciences Po University in Paris.</p><p>François Hollande, a former French president, has proposed <a href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/17/textes/l17b1338_proposition-loi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a law</a> to create a “scientific refugee” status for researchers threatened for their work in their countries.</p><p>However, <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/idees-et-debats/stand-up-for-science-et-apres-20250320_PAEXRBEBOFHK5FRZLAGXCUFUIM/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some university heads and professors</a> have criticized the initiative.
