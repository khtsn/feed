But any discussion of the topic feels incomplete without a fuller picture of the complicated reasons that someone might choose to ghost. To that end, I’m exploring ghosting for an upcoming issue of The New York Times Magazine about sex, love and relationships.</p><p>So if you’ve ever ghosted somebody, I’d like to hear from you. Maybe there was a breakup conversation that felt impossible to initiate. Maybe a romantic partner did or said something that turned you away. Maybe a tangle of feelings or logistics made it seem simpler, or even kinder, to ghost.</p><p>I’m a reporter and audio producer for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily" title="">The Daily</a>, The Times’s flagship news podcast. Although I primarily work in audio, this story about ghosting will be an article in the magazine. I’m hoping to better understand, in all its nuances, a feature of dating that many of us have experienced and participated in.</p><p>I’ll read every submission, and I’ll contact you if I’m interested in learning more about your story. The Times won’t publish any part of your name or your story unless I’ve reached out to you personally and had a conversation with you. We also won’t share your contact information outside our newsroom or use it for any reason other than to follow up with you.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Times strives to publish full names whenever possible, to be fully honest and transparent with our audience. If you might not feel comfortable with that, please share your story anyway and we can discuss the best approach. Again, we’ll never publish any part of your name or your story without your understanding.</p></div></section></article></div>
