    <h1>Trump Poses With a Tesla, a Move Aimed Solely at Helping Musk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Trump hosted an exclusive car show at the White House on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>The only company represented: Tesla. The only purpose: helping Elon Musk.</p><p>With Tesla facing a backlash over Mr. Musk’s role in the Trump administration, the president said he wanted to buy one of the company’s electric vehicles. But Mr. Trump, always a salesman, did not just want to purchase a car. He wanted to hawk it and help out his friend, who also happens to be Tesla’s chief executive.</p><p>The 30-minute confab was part news conference, part car commercial as Mr. Trump oscillated between answering questions — about the stock market, Canadian tariffs and the war in Ukraine — and trying out five different Tesla cars.</p><p>“The one I like is that one,” Mr. Trump said, pointing at a bright red Model S, which costs roughly $80,000. “And I want that same color.” (Mr. Musk, who was standing beside the president, seemingly tried to sell him on a Cybertruck, saying: “This is bulletproof.”)</p></div></div>
