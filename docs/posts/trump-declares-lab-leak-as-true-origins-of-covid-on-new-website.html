Carrying an image of President Trump flanked by the words “Lab Leak,” the new page is illustrated by a satellite image of Wuhan, China, the city where Covid began spreading, and says it will describe “the true origins of Covid-19.”</p><p>The website notes that the city is home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a coronavirus lab that had been involved with research projects that some scientists considered dangerous. It also alludes to concerns that the lab had conducted its work under improper safety conditions. C.I.A. officials cited those same concerns when the agency recently shifted its position to favor a lab leak.</p><p>But the page sidesteps holes in that theory — a number of large Chinese cities, for example, have labs that reported studying viruses like those the Wuhan institute worked on — and does not address the considerable evidence from early cases and viral genomes that the virus instead spilled from animals into humans at an illegal wild-animal market. It also cites a number of misleading or heavily contested claims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The purging of old Covid websites reflects a broader practice by the Trump administration of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/health/trump-cdc-dei-gender.html" title="">scrapping health websites</a> that do not align with its views, including ones related to climate change and L.G.B.T.Q. people. (Some of those pages were later restored.)</p><p>And it has turned what used to be the government’s main portals for disseminating reliable information about the virus into a vehicle for attacking the administration’s political enemies, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, who led a federal research institute that awarded funding to a virus-hunting nonprofit that worked with scientists in Wuhan.</p><p>While Covid is killing far fewer people than at the height of the pandemic, the United States has continued to <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record hundreds of Covid deaths</a> each week in recent months.</p><p>In addition to arguing for a lab leak, the website condemns the World Health Organization for its decisions during the pandemic, attacks former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York for sending Covid patients to nursing homes, and criticizes measures that were used in efforts to prevent the early spread of Covid, like lockdowns and masking.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump returned to office, White House officials have begun describing the lab leak theory as “confirmable truth.” The C.I.A. also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/cia-covid-lab-leak.html" title="">shifted its assessment</a> to favor a lab leak, though with “low confidence”; the agency’s shift was not based on new intelligence, but rather a closer look at evidence about safety conditions in Wuhan labs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The new website’s case for a lab leak contains significant inaccuracies. It begins by saying, of Covid, that “the virus possesses a biological characteristic that is not found in nature.” That appears to be a reference to the furin cleavage site, a feature that helps the virus get inside cells.</p><p>In the very early days of the pandemic, scientists themselves were alarmed by the presence of that feature on the virus. But as they studied it more closely, they found that furin cleavage sites are in fact common in other coronaviruses, even if they have not so far been detected in the closest known relatives of the pandemic virus.</p><p>Scientists who have scrutinized the furin cleavage site have said it contains many features showing it was not engineered. They have argued, in fact, that constructing a virus in a lab would most likely result in that site being deleted.</p><p>The new website also says that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology “were sick with Covid-like symptoms in the fall of 2019,” suggesting that the virus was spreading at the lab before it began infecting people at the wild-animal market.</p><p>But a <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Report-on-Potential-Links-Between-the-Wuhan-Institute-of-Virology-and-the-Origins-of-COVID-19-20230623.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declassified in 2023, complicates that assessment. That report says that “some of the symptoms were not consistent with Covid-19.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The workers, the report concludes, “experienced a range of symptoms consistent with colds or allergies with accompanying symptoms typically not associated with Covid-19, and some of them were confirmed to have been sick with other illnesses unrelated to Covid-19.”</p><p>That report was released two years after the Biden administration, in 2021, ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate the origins of the virus.</p><p>Around that same time, mainstream scientists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/health/wuhan-coronavirus-lab-leak.html" title="">called for an open investigation</a> of the virus’s origins that took seriously the possibility of a lab leak. Some scientists expressed frustration that colleagues earlier in the pandemic had been too quick to dismiss the theory, including in a report by W.H.O.-chosen experts in collaboration with Chinese scientists.</p><p>But since that time, researchers who specialize in tracing outbreaks, including some who joined calls for evenhanded investigations of the origins, have published detailed analyses of early cases and viral genomes that pointed to the pandemic’s starting at an illegal wild-animal market in Wuhan.</p><p>They found, among other things, that early Covid patients lived around the wild-animal market in a pattern that could not be explained by chance, and that the virus had appeared to spill over from animals into people working or shopping at the market on multiple occasions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That scenario is also consistent, they have said, with samples taken from the market that contained the coronavirus along with genetic material belonging to raccoon dogs, which were being sold at the market.</p><p>At the same time, there is no evidence that the Wuhan virology institute possessed a virus that could have become the one that caused the pandemic: The director of national intelligence has said there was no indication that the virology institute had been in possession of the pandemic coronavirus “or a close progenitor.”</p><p>Carl Zimmer<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Mueller reports on health and medicine.
