Putin of Russia.</p><p>It was a complete reversal of historic alliances that left many in Europe stunned and fearful.</p><p>“What’s happening is very bad. It’s a reversal of the state of the world since 1945,” Jean- Yves Le Drian, a former French foreign minister, said on French radio Wednesday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s our security he’s putting at risk,” he said, referring to President Trump. “We must wake up.”</p><p>Fear that Mr. Trump is ready to abandon Ukraine and has accepted Russian talking points has been particularly acute in Eastern and Central Europe, where memories are long and bitter of the West’s efforts to appease Hitler in Munich in 1938 and its assent to Stalin’s demands at the Yalta Conference in 1945 for a Europe cleaved in two.</p><p>“Even Poland’s betrayal in Yalta lasted longer than Ukraine’s betrayal in Riyadh,” Jaroslaw Walesa, a Polish lawmaker and the son of Poland’s anti-Communist Solidarity trade union leader, Lech Walesa, said Wednesday on <a href="https://x.com/WalesaJL/status/1892121068866884018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1892121068866884018%7Ctwgr%5E21f9a9d9fde2424767daabf13831d7bc71ad78ab%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpulsembed.eu%2Fp2em%2FZG5lJGwB3%2F" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media,</a> referring to the American-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.</p><p>Rasa Jukneviciene, a former Lithuania defense minister who is now a member of the European Parliament, said it was “hard to understand” the sudden shifts in policy by the United States, the once reliable pillar of Europe’s security for decades. She said she was “wondering what historians will write about the events of this time, say, in five decades.”</p><p>“It is already clear that the Euro-Atlantic connection will not be the same as it used to be,” she said. “The stage when European security after World War II was basically guaranteed only by the U.S.A. is over.”</p><p>Europe, she added, “is once again facing existential challenges” — akin to those in 1938 after Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of Britain met Hitler in Munich and agreed to his annexation of parts of Czechoslovakia with a large ethnic German population.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the power vacuum, Mr. Macron has tried to show leadership, corralling allied leaders to devise a united response.</p><p>The Élysée Palace announced that he would host a second emergency meeting on Wednesday of many European leaders who had not been included in the meeting on Monday. Among them was the interim president of Romania, Ilie Bolojan, who would attend in person, while other leaders from Finland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Greece, Sweden and Belgium planned to attend by video.</p><p>The meeting comes the day after Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian representatives including Foreign Minister Sergei V. Lavrov in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a peace deal for the war in Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/middleeast/ukraine-trump-russia-war-peace-talks.html" title="">to the fury of its president, Volodymyr Zelensky,</a> who was not invited.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, seated second from left, meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V.

And a long time before that,” Mr. Trump said. “This could have been settled very easily. Just a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without, I think, without the loss of much land, very little land. Without the loss of any lives. And without the loss of cities that are just laying on their sides.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s comments blaming Ukraine for the war stirred outrage in the Czech Republic, whose centrist government has been a stalwart supporter of Ukraine. “I’m afraid we’ve never been this close to Orwell’s ‘war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength’ before,” Interior Minister <a href="https://x.com/Vit_Rakusan/status/1892195384014901700" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vit Rakusan said on social media.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Le Drian called it a monstrous reversal of world alliances, as well as an “inversion of the truth.”</p><p>“The victim becomes the attacker,” he said, adding that the United States seemed to be retreating to a 19th-century view of itself, and telling an aggressive, expansionist Russia to do what it wants in Europe. “It’s the law of the strongest,” he said, adding “tomorrow, it could be Moldavia and after tomorrow, it could be Estonia because Putin won’t stop.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at a news conference in Ankara, Turkey, on Tuesday.

They are also talking about how to ramp up the development of European defense industries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Over the past week, Europe’s steadfast position that held the United States as the central pole of its defense guarantee seems to be changing, said Martin Quencez, the director of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund.</p><p>The big question will be whether European nations follow through with increased military spending and maintain a united front, without fracturing off to individually negotiate with Mr. Trump, he said.</p><p>“I’ve heard Europe talk about wake-up calls so many times over the past 10 years, I remain cautious,” he said, pointing out that many European leaders, including Mr. Macron, find themselves in fragile political and economic positions in their own countries.</p><p>“I’m sure we will hear from every European leader, but let’s see what actual decisions are taken,” he said, adding: “It’s very, very difficult to tell your population., we’re going to have to make the tough choice of prioritizing European security over, social issues or environmental issues. Not many governments have the political capital to spend on all this.”</p><p>Poland, the biggest and most militarily powerful country in the European Union’s formerly communist east, sought on Tuesday evening after the talks in Saudi Arabia ended, to calm the panic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>That day, President Andrzej Duda was visited in Warsaw by Mr. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general. The Polish leader said Mr. Kellogg reassured him that “there are absolutely no American intentions to reduce activity here in our part of Europe, especially in the field of security, to reduce the number of American soldiers.”</p><p>The United States has thousands of soldiers in Poland and in November opened a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/world/europe/poland-missile-base-russia-ukraine.html" title="">missile defense facility near the Baltic Sea</a> that Russia sees as a threat to its own security.
