in which the men were made to give speeches effectively at gunpoint.</p><p>The hostage release is the fifth in a tense series of exchanges that are part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/israel-cabinet-ceasefire-gaza.html" title="">a 42-day cease-fire deal</a> that went into effect last month pausing the fighting between Israel and Hamas. Hamas agreed to incrementally release 33 of the nearly 100 remaining hostages in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel and a partial Israeli withdrawal.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the Israelis released on Saturday:</p><h2 id="link-10f41463">Ohad Ben Ami</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A painting of Raz Ben Ami and her husband Ohad Ben Ami.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Ben Ami, who was 54 when he was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri in southern Israel, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bringhomenow_uk/p/C7-JIrSNdLR/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was the kibbutz’s accountant</a> and is an avid cyclist.

She was critical of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/world/middleeast/hostages-netanyahu-congress.html" title="">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision</a> to speak in Congress in July, saying he should not travel abroad until there was an agreement to free the hostages.
