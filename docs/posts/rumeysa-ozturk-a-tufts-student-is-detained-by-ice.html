Ms. Ozturk, who is Muslim, was heading out to break her Ramadan fast with friends Tuesday night when she was detained by agents from the Department of Homeland Security near her apartment in Somerville, Mass., Ms. Khanbabai said.</p><p>“We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her,” the lawyer said. “No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of.”</p><p>A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the department, did not immediately respond to questions on Wednesday about the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tufts administrators were told that the student’s visa had been terminated, the university’s president, Sunil Kumar, wrote in an email to students, staff and faculty members Tuesday night. He said in the email that the university was “seeking to confirm whether that information is true.”</p><p>Late on Tuesday, Judge Indira Talwani of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts ordered that Ms. Ozturk not be moved out of the state without advance written notice to the court from the government. Judge Talwani’s order said that Ms. Ozturk had asked that a judge determine whether her detention was lawful.</p><p>Ms. Ozturk’s court petition named as respondents Patricia Hyde, the acting director of the Boston field office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and other ICE officials.</p><p>Mr. Kumar wrote in the email that Tufts administrators had no prior knowledge of the plan to detain the student, and did not share any information with federal authorities ahead of time.</p><p>“We realize that tonight’s news will be distressing to some members of our community, particularly the members of our international community,” Mr. Kumar wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Ozturk was listed as one of several authors of an opinion essay published last March in the Tufts student newspaper. The essay criticized university leaders for their response to demands that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and divest itself from companies with ties to Israel.</p><p>She is one of several students who have been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-ice-louisiana.html" title="">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a recent Columbia University graduate and leader of pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations who has permanent U.S. residency, was arrested by federal immigration officers in New York. Though he has not been charged with any crime, the Trump administration has argued that he should be deported to prevent the spread of antisemitism.</p><p>At Tufts, the president’s email reminded students of the university’s “established protocol for responding to government agents who arrive on campus (or off-campus) for an unannounced site visit,” which encourages them to call the university police in such situations.</p><p>With the caveat that the basis for Ms. Ozturk’s detention was not known, Tyler Coward, lead counsel for government affairs at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech advocacy group, said that trying to deport students based on their speech or activism undermines America’s commitment to free expression.</p><p>“If ICE detained Ozturk based on her op-ed or activism, it’s a worrying escalation in an already fraught environment for college students here on student visas,” Mr. Coward said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While studying psychology as an undergraduate at Istanbul Sehir University, Ms. Ozturk worked closely with one of her professors, Fatima Tuba Yaylaci, in the psychology lab and as a student assistant. Ms. Ozturk was interested in child development and how children understand concepts like death and life, the professor said.</p><p>“She is a person who wouldn’t hurt a soul,” Ms. Yaylaci said in an interview on Wednesday. “She is extremely sensitive about human rights, about not hurting people, about diversity. She is a person who wants to include everyone.”</p><p>The professor said they had never discussed Palestinians during their time together, before Ms. Ozturk received a Fulbright scholarship and enrolled in a master’s program at Columbia University’s Teachers College, where she received a degree in 2020. “Her relations with people were really good, but she was not an organizational, activist-type leader in terms of politics,” Ms. Yaylaci said.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, the professor said, she received a message from Ms. Ozturk, asking her to remove pictures of her with friends from the social media account of the lab. Ms. Ozturk told her she was being doxxed, meaning that personal information about her was being posted maliciously online.</p><p>“This is a very hard day for me too, I am very sad,” Ms. Yaylaci said. “I hope this issue will be resolved. She is such a valuable researcher for children in Turkey and in the U.S. too.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Canary Mission, a group that says it fights hatred of Jews on college campuses, has posted a photo of Ms. Ozturk on its website, identifying her as a student at Tufts and saying that she “<a href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">engaged</a> in anti-Israel activism in March 2024,” a possible reference to her opinion essay. Pro-Palestinian activists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/nyregion/college-campus-protests-anonymity.html" title="">have said the group exposes their identities, making them targets of harassment</a>.</p><p>President Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 29 saying his administration would take steps to combat antisemitism, including on campuses. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The order</a> said it would be U.S. policy to use “all available and appropriate legal tools,” including to “remove” aliens who engage in “unlawful antisemitic harassment and violence.”</p><p>“Nobody should be disappeared from the streets of Somerville — or anywhere in America,” Jessie Rossman, legal director of the A.C.L.U. of Massachusetts, said on Wednesday. “Everyone should be alarmed by what’s shown in the video of Ms. Ozturk being handcuffed and taken away by agents. The government must immediately release her to her friends and community in Massachusetts.”</p><p>Tufts’s main campus is in Medford, Mass., a small city seven miles northwest of Boston and adjacent to Somerville, where the student was detained.</p><p>Anemona Hartocollis contributed reporting. Kitty Bennett contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jenna Russell is the lead reporter covering New England for The Times.
