The results of a presidential election in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/europe/romania-election-court.html" title="">Romania</a> were thrown out over concerns the app had been used to spread foreign influence. Albania banned TikTok for a year following the stabbing death of a teenager by another one after the two quarreled online.</p><p>“Either TikTok protects the children of Albania, or Albania will protect its children from TikTok,” the prime minister, Edi Rama, said on X.</p><p>That was all in just the last month.</p><p>This week in the United States, where about 150 million people use the app, TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, are asking the Supreme Court to strike down a law that would force the app to be sold or banned.</p><p>TikTok has confronted legal and political scrutiny around the world in recent years, facing outright or partial bans in at least 20 countries, as governments have grown alarmed by its ties to China and its wide influence, especially among young people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Despite the mounting scrutiny, TikTok remains incredibly popular worldwide. More than a billion people use the app every month.</p><p>TikTok’s novelty comes from its proprietary algorithm, which recommends a constant stream of content, mostly short videos, calibrated to keep people scrolling. ByteDance pioneered the technology in 2016 with TikTok’s sister app, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/business/china-tiktok-douyin.html" title="">Douyin</a>, which has become one of China’s most popular apps and drives the majority of the company’s revenue. ByteDance knew it could be a hit overseas and launched TikTok in 2017.</p><p>But as TikTok’s algorithm captured attention spans around the world, it alarmed lawmakers, who say TikTok has quickly turned from a domain of cat videos and dance trends into a potentially disruptive social, political and economic force.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shou Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, in Singapore.

Lawmakers also worry TikTok could share user data like location and browsing history with the Chinese government. Young people need to be protected from “the frightening pitfalls of the algorithm,” said Mr. Rama, the Albanian prime minister.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>TikTok has insisted that the concerns are overblown. It has teams dedicated to combating influence operations, whose work it makes public, the company said in a statement. TikTok’s algorithm, which it aims to “maintain content neutrality,” ranks content based on what users express interest in, the company said.</p><p>TikTok has said ByteDance is majority-owned by global investors. At the same time, the Chinese government has claimed authority to oppose any sale.</p><p>As other Chinese companies look to do more business overseas, TikTok has become both a model and a cautionary tale. The app showed that a new kind of entertainment first popularized in China could catch on elsewhere. But it also paved the way for blowback against Chinese apps like Temu and Shein.</p><p>“It feels like every Chinese entrepreneur needs a political science or international relations degree to be able to navigate their future now,” said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies.</p><p>Other companies with global internet products, like Meta and Google, also face scrutiny around the world, said Jianggan Li, the chief executive of Momentum Works, a consultancy in Singapore. “But being U.S. companies, they do not face the mistrust that TikTok has faced in the eyes of politicians and regulators in the West,” Mr. Li said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Here is how governments have gone after TikTok.</p><h2 id="link-a2f3365">Total ban: India and Nepal</h2><p>A ban in the United States could cut TikTok off from one of its most important markets. But TikTok has already gone through the experience of losing what at the time was its largest audience. The Indian government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/business/tiktok-india-ban.html" title="">banned the app in 2020</a> after India’s simmering geopolitical conflict with China boiled over into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/indian-china-border-clash.html" title="">hand-to-hand combat</a> along their shared border.</p><p>TikTok vanished from app stores, and its website was blocked, forcing creators who had made their living on the app to rebuild their audiences on other platforms. A few homegrown alternatives emerged, but American tech giants were the biggest winners. Both YouTube and Instagram now have roughly twice as many users in India as they have in the United States.</p><p>Officials in neighboring Nepal took TikTok offline for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/asia/nepal-tiktok-china.html" title="">nearly a year</a> over its refusal to curb content the government described as hate speech that disturbed “social harmony.” The ban was overturned in August after the current prime minister, K.P. Sharma Oli, took charge of the government for the fourth time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>TikTok creators rallied in Washington last winter to support the app.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-7bb44b02">Fines and forced local tie-ups: Russia and Indonesia</h2><p>The Russian government has fined TikTok repeatedly for allowing content to circulate that does not abide by the country’s censorship rules, including on topics like sex, gender and feminism. The two most recent fines, levied by Russian courts in the past six months, added up to about $90,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In Indonesia, TikTok launched online shopping, which it is betting big on as a new revenue stream. The app has nearly as many users in Indonesia, the largest country in Southeast Asia, as in the United States. But in 2023, the government passed a law that forced TikTok to shut its online shopping business down in a matter of days.</p><p>TikTok Shop was able to reopen only after it had merged operations with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/tiktok-bytedance-tokopedia-indonesia.html" title="">Indonesia’s biggest e-commerce company</a>, Tokopedia. It has been slow going for many shop owners rebuilding their audiences, but for TikTok, the ordeal came with a perk: access to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/tiktok-indonesia-tokopedia-ecommerce-logistics.html" title="">network of delivery drivers</a> and logistics services built to get packages across Indonesia’s 17,000 islands.</p><h2 id="link-e91576c">Blocked on government devices: Taiwan, Britain, Canada and others</h2><p>Some governments have tried to balance concerns about TikTok’s security with free expression.</p><p>Taiwan banned the app from government devices in 2019. But officials say they aren’t contemplating a wholesale ban because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/business/tiktok-taiwan.html" title="">they do not want to curb</a> Taiwan’s culture of public debate. Britain, Australia and France, as well as the executive arm of the European Union and New Zealand’s Parliament, have adopted the same approach.</p><p>In documents filed in Canadian court last month to challenge the order, TikTok claimed that the Canadian government had directed it to delay overdue paperwork until the United States had decided on its approach to the company.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/meaghan-tobin">More about Meaghan Tobin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/tiktok">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-supreme-court">U.S. Supreme Court</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/01/09/technology/tiktok-ban-global-legal-battles.html">195</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/01/09/technology/tiktok-ban-global-legal-battles.html">195</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The World of TikTok</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A New Type of Influencer: </strong>After being diagnosed with A.L.S., Brooke Eby <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/well/brooke-eby-als-tiktok-instagram.html">joined a niche group of content creators</a> with terminal illnesses documenting the progression of their diseases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sale-or-Ban Law: </strong>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/us/politics/supreme-court-tiktok-ban.html">agreed to hear TikTok’s challenge</a> to a law that requires its Chinese parent company to sell the app or face a ban in the United States as of Jan. 19, putting the case on an exceptionally fast track.</p></li><li><p><strong>Beef and Beauty: </strong>Natural, beef tallow-based cosmetics can be made at home or bought from artisans.
