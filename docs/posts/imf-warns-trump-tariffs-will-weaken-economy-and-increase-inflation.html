Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has imposed a wide range of tariffs on most of America’s trading partners, while ratcheting levies even higher on imports from China, Canada and Mexico.</p><p>“Our new growth projections will include notable markdowns, but not recession,” Kristalina Georgieva, the I.M.F. managing director, said on Thursday in a speech ahead of the spring meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank. “We will also see markups to the inflation forecasts for some countries.”</p><p>Ms. Georgieva’s comments added to a growing chorus of top economic officials, including the heads of the Federal Reserve and the World Bank, who have sounded alarms this week about the potential harm that Mr. Trump’s policies could cause.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The European Central Bank on Thursday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/business/european-central-bank-rates-tariffs-trump.html" title="">lowered interest rates</a>, saying that “the outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions.” Central bankers, finance ministers and other policymakers will gather in Washington next week as they continue to grapple with how to respond.</p><p>Ms. Georgieva was careful in her criticism of the Trump administration’s policies, which have created widespread uncertainty for businesses and are disrupting international supply chains. But she made clear her concerns about the costs of protectionism.</p><p>“Ultimately, trade is like water,” Ms. Georgieva said. “When countries put up obstacles in the form of tariff and non-tariff barriers, the flow diverts.”</p><p>She added: “Some sectors in some countries may be flooded by cheap imports; others may see shortages. Trade goes on, but disruptions incur costs.”</p><p>Ms. Georgieva’s speech came as organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank are facing fresh questions about their viability, in part because of new skepticism from the United States about the value of international financial institutions. As the world’s largest economy, the United States plays a leading role in steering the direction of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, but some of their initiatives on climate change and other policy matters are at odds with the Trump administration’s priorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In her remarks, Ms. Georgieva acknowledged that jobs losses associated with earlier decades of liberalized trade and globalization had created a sense of unfairness in some places, fueling the concerns about national security and self-reliance that have led to a resurgence of protectionism. She argued that such policies, however, were taking a toll on smaller economies and emerging markets, raising prices around the world and dampening productivity.</p><p>“In trade policy, the goal must be to secure a settlement among the largest players that preserves openness and delivers a more level playing field — to restart a global trend toward lower tariff rates while also reducing non-tariff barriers and distortions,” Ms. Georgieva said.</p><p>Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank was similarly weighing how to navigate a situation where Mr. Trump’s tariffs could lead to slower growth and higher inflation.</p><p>“We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension,” Mr. Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago. “If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.”</p><p>On Thursday morning, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/business/economy/trump-jerome-powell-fed.html" title="">Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Powell</a>, saying that the Fed chair was wrong to not be lowering interest rates in the United States. He added that Mr. Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Slower global growth is expected to take a particularly tough toll on developing countries, which have been slow to emerge from the pandemic. Their troubles are compounded by the fact that they now face a pullback of foreign aid from the United States.</p><p>Ajay Banga, the president of the World Bank, this week urged developing countries to lower their trade barriers to avoid higher U.S. tariffs and to maintain their own regional trade relationships as the international commerce system comes under pressure. He also noted that he expected global growth to be weaker than previously projections this year.</p><p>“Countries need to care about negotiating and dialogue,” Mr. Banga told reporters on Wednesday. “It’s going to be really important in this phase, and the quicker we do it, the better that will be.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.
