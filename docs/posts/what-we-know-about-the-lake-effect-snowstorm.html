Millions were under lake-effect snow warnings, freeze alerts and other winter advisories on Sunday afternoon. </p><p>The storm is expected to continue dumping snow in the region into the week, meteorologists said. Some areas could see up to six feet of snow by Tuesday, with the heaviest snowfall expected along the belly of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario in Pennsylvania and New York. Governors of both states have made disaster declarations in these areas and deployed National Guard troops.</p><p>“It’s going to be pretty brutal,” said Brian Hurley, a senior meteorologist at the National Weather Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There have been some reports of minor injuries, and no reports of deaths, from this storm so far.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the lake-effect snowstorm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Heavy Snowfall Blankets Parts of the Great Lakes Region</h2><h4>States braced for more whiteout conditions in the coming days as a lake-effect storm dropped several feet of snow in parts of the region by the early weekend.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Uh, yeah.

Copenhagen, a village in the town of Denmark located about an hour north of Syracuse, was inundated with over 58 inches, according to the National Weather Service. (Both the village and town were named after their counterparts in northern Europe.) West Carthage, a village of about 2,000 located nearby, received 41 inches. And Watertown received over 37 inches. </p><p>Northern Michigan got record-breaking snowfall on Friday. The resort town of Gaylord received over two feet, breaking a previous daily record of 17 inches in 1942, <a href="https://x.com/nwsgaylord/status/1862850934541595131?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Weather Service said.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>At least <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/crh/snowmap.html?sid=lot" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an additional two feet of snow</a> had fallen over parts of the Upper Peninsula by Sunday afternoon, and another 10 inches were expected, forecasters said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers cleared snow from the seats in Highmark Stadium ahead of a Sunday game between the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers in Orchard Park, N.Y.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gene J.

The weather may be clear in one area, but there could be heavy snow and poor visibility just a few miles away.</p><p>On Saturday, Pennsylvania officials said that hundreds of vehicles had been stranded. Some motorists slept in their vehicles at nearby gas stations to wait out the hazardous conditions. One woman’s trip from Buffalo to Columbus, Ohio, took over 24 hours after she was stuck for hours on the highway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Brenton Davis, the executive of Erie County, Pa., said on Sunday that crews were still digging out abandoned vehicles. By the afternoon, workers had cleared the vehicles blocking travel lanes on state roads, according to Michael Carroll, Pennsylvania’s secretary of transportation.</p><p>“Progress is being made by the hour,” Mr. Carroll said. </p><p>But forecasters warned that favorable conditions may not last, with the city of Erie expected to receive up to three more inches of snow overnight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The storm dumped more than four feet of snow around Buffalo and its southern suburbs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Normile/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6c899b4d">When will it end?</h2><p>Forecasters expect the lake-effect snow to continue through at least Tuesday, though the intensity of the storm is expected to taper out by then.</p><p>The areas around Lake Erie in Pennsylvania and New York could see another two or three feet of snow, Mr. Hurley said. Michigan’s Upper Peninsula could get an additional two feet, and forecasters expect another 11 or so inches in northeastern Ohio by Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A shift in air flow is forecast to push the snow into central New York starting Sunday evening, bringing three to six inches to the Syracuse, N.Y., area.</p><p>The changing conditions may provide only a brief reprieve, as forecasters <a href="https://x.com/NWSWPC/status/1863175025353982111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predict</a> more lake-effect snow could return later in the week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Snowfall in Buffalo on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jalen Wright for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-397c4a03">What’s causing the storm, and when did it start?</h2><p>The lake-effect storm, which began on Thursday, was the result of persistent winds pushing cold air over the relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes. This type of storm usually picks up moisture over the lakes and dumps it over colder land once moving ashore, turning it into huge amounts of snow.</p><p>Lake-effect snow is typical in the Great Lakes region this time of year, Mr. Hurley said, as water temperatures are as warm as they will be through the rest of the season.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“They were actually above normal going into the Thanksgiving weekend,” Mr. Hurley said, referring to water temperatures.</p><p>“That gives you more energy, more moisture, more instability off the lakes with that cold air blowing over it,” he added.</p><p>Experts predict that climate change could <a href="https://glisa.umich.edu/resources-tools/climate-impacts/snow-in-the-great-lakes-past-present-and-the-future/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase</a> the amount of lake-effect snowfall in the short term as warmer lake temperatures and longer ice-free periods lead to more evaporation that can fuel these storms. Researchers have found that lake-effect snowfall <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S038013300800004X" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has risen</a> around Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. However, as the climate continues to warm, more of this precipitation may fall as rain instead of snow.</p><h2 id="link-68a0223e">How else has the storm affected communities?</h2><p>Aside from travel snags, the snowstorm upended plans for even people who had stayed put. Schools announced snow days for Monday. Church services were canceled, and many businesses were closed. Local events, like the one in Erie that was supposed to feature local vendors, restaurants and museums, were postponed.</p><p>On Sunday in Erie, residents armed with shovels worked to dig out vehicles or clear driveways, even as the snow continued to fall around them. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Jeremy Hodges had spent about an hour chipping away at the snow around his car, but with little progress to show for it. Shaking his head, he said, “I don’t think it’s going to happen today.”</p><p>In Buffalo, officials for the Bills <a href="https://x.com/BuffaloBills/status/1862585596390043814" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recruited</a> fans to shovel snow ahead of the team’s game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. In exchange, they offered $20 per hour, along with hot drinks and food. (And shovels were provided, of course.) </p><p>As many people hunkered down, some tried to brave the snow, only to quickly turn around. But some people capitalized on the snow, going sledding or just viewing it as a winter adventure.</p><p>Robert Warner, a manager of an Irish pub in Buffalo, said the storm would actually help his business. Asked if it might prompt him to close the pub, he said: “Lord, no! If anything, we’ll be busier.”</p><p>Emmett Lindner<!-- -->, <!-- -->Cole Louison<!-- -->, <!-- -->Daniel McGraw<!-- -->, <!-- -->Kara Murphy<!-- --> and <!-- -->Brandon K.
