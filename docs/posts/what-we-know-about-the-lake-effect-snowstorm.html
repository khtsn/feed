Well over two feet of snow had fallen in many parts of the region, with some communities seeing more than three feet, and millions were under lake-effect snow warnings and freeze alerts, among other winter advisories, as of Sunday afternoon.</p><p>“It’s going to be pretty brutal,” Brian Hurley, a senior meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said on Saturday.</p><p>Some areas could see up to six feet of snow by Tuesday, with the heaviest snowfall expected along the belly of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario in Pennsylvania and New York. Governors of both states have made disaster declarations in these areas and deployed National Guard troops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There have been some reports of minor injuries, and no reports of deaths, from the storm so far.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the lake-effect snowstorm.</p><h2 id="link-2f9d0a9d">Where has it snowed the most?</h2><p>So far, parts of the eastern Great Lakes region, along a roughly 160-mile stretch of Interstate 90 spanning from northeast Ohio to Buffalo, and northern Michigan have gotten the heaviest amounts of snow.</p><p>Additionally, several communities in New York <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/crh/snowmap.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received</a> over 40 inches of snow. Copenhagen, a village in the town of Denmark located about an hour north of Syracuse, was inundated with 46 inches, according to the National Weather Service. (Both the village and town were named after their counterparts in northern Europe.) West Carthage, a village of about 2,000 located nearby, received 41 inches.</p><p>Michigan’s Upper Peninsula got record-breaking snowfall on Friday. The resort town of Gaylord received over two feet, breaking a previous daily record of 17 inches in 1942, <a href="https://x.com/nwsgaylord/status/1862850934541595131?s=46&amp;t=8H3FDbkvfJkXNtBv_SrGPg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Weather Service said.</a></p><p>At least <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/crh/snowmap.html?sid=lot" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an additional two feet of snow</a> had fallen over parts of the Upper Peninsula by Sunday morning, and another 10 inches were expected on Sunday, forecasters said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But on Sunday, the brunt of the snow — up to a foot and a half — is expected to fall on Watertown, N.Y., a city of about 25,000 on the eastern banks of Lake Ontario. Mayor Sarah Pierce of Watertown had canceled city events on Saturday and said there was <a href="https://mailchi.mp/002ccb0017ca/from-the-mayors-desk-a-newsletter-from-mayor-sarah-pierce-577?fbclid=IwY2xjawG4mHFleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHQAUjd2FUvgaGyfjonrGzhlOO8LNlO9Xj5UK3a9pPJ6YAbYDdlYv-jQKJA_aem_mYRd2TNOuFzKOyEqU6aSnA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an “all hands on deck” effort</a> across city departments to respond to the storm.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Clearing the snow from a sidewalk in Hamburg, N.Y.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jalen Wright for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-3247fc65">Are roads closed? What about airports?</h2><p>The snow has wreaked havoc on travelers, prompting road closures and commercial truck bans along sections of the Interstate 90 in New York near the Pennsylvania state line on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>Officials urged motorists to stay home. The National Weather Service in Cleveland <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=BUF&amp;wwa=lake%20effect%20snow%20warning" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> of whiteout conditions that could make travel “treacherous and potentially life-threatening.”</p><p>Lake-effect snow is especially dangerous for drivers because conditions can change rapidly — the weather may be clear in one area, but there could be heavy snow and poor visibility just a few miles away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Hundreds of vehicles had been stranded on the roads, Brenton Davis, the executive of Erie County, Pa., said on Saturday. Some motorists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/lake-effect-snow-buffalo-ny-great-lakes.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">slept in their vehicles</a> at nearby gas stations to wait out the hazardous conditions on Friday night. One woman who was traveling from Buffalo to her home in Columbus, Ohio, said the trip took more than 24 hours after she was stranded on the highway for hours.</p><p>On Sunday morning in Erie, snowplows, fire trucks and other municipal vehicles were stuck in the snow, alongside a growing number of stranded cars — some abandoned in the middle of the road. </p><p>After <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NYSThruway/videos/1648418342693803" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crews with snowblowers worked to plow the roadway</a> on Interstate 90 through the day on Saturday, the highway reopened in the evening, though commercial vehicles were still prohibited on the interstate from Ohio to the New York State line on Saturday night.</p><p><a href="https://www.alpinesystemsinc.com/remote/erie-split1515.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Erie International Airport</a> in Pennsylvania was closed for most of Saturday before reopening in the evening.</p><h2 id="link-6c899b4d">When will it end?</h2><p>Forecasters expect the lake-effect snow to continue through at least Tuesday, though the intensity of the storm is expected to taper out by then.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“In the next 72 hours, we are still looking at additional multiple feet to the tune of three, maybe as much as four more feet,” Mr. Hurley said on Saturday evening.</p><p>The areas around Lake Erie in Pennsylvania and New York could see another two or three feet of snow, he added. Michigan’s Upper Peninsula could get an additional two feet, and forecasters expect another 12 to 18 inches in northeastern Ohio by Tuesday. In Buffalo, up to <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NYZ010&amp;warncounty=NYC029&amp;firewxzone=NYZ201&amp;local_place1=3%20Miles%20SE%20West%20Seneca%20NY&amp;product1=Hazardous+Weather+Outlook&amp;lat=42.8083&amp;lon=-78.7019" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20 inches of snow</a> could fall through Sunday.</p><p>A shift in air flow is forecast to push the snow into central New York starting Sunday evening, bringing three to six inches to the Syracuse, N.Y., area.</p><p>The changing conditions may provide only a brief reprieve, as forecasters <a href="https://x.com/NWSWPC/status/1863175025353982111" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predict</a> more lake-effect snow could return later in the week.</p><h2 id="link-397c4a03">What’s causing the storm, and when did it start?</h2><p>The lake-effect storm, which began on Thursday, was the result of persistent winds pushing cold air over the relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes. This type of storm usually picks up moisture over the lakes and dumps it over colder land once moving ashore, turning it into huge amounts of snow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Lake-effect snow is typical in the Great Lakes region this time of year, Mr. Hurley said, as water temperatures are as warm as they will be through the rest of the season.</p><p>“They were actually above normal going into the Thanksgiving weekend,” Mr. Hurley said, referring to water temperatures.</p><p>“That gives you more energy, more moisture, more instability off the lakes with that cold air blowing over it,” he added.</p><p>Experts predict that climate change could <a href="https://glisa.umich.edu/resources-tools/climate-impacts/snow-in-the-great-lakes-past-present-and-the-future/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase</a> the amount of lake-effect snowfall in the short term as warmer lake temperatures and longer ice-free periods lead to more evaporation that can fuel these storms. Researchers have found that lake-effect snowfall <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S038013300800004X" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has risen</a> around Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. However, as the climate continues to warm, more of this precipitation may fall as rain instead of snow.</p><h2 id="link-68a0223e">How else has the storm affected communities?</h2><p>Aside from travel snags, the snowstorm upended plans for even people who had stayed put. Schools announced snow days for Monday. Church services were canceled, and many businesses were closed. Local events, like the one in Erie that was supposed to feature local vendors, restaurants and museums, were postponed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On Sunday in Erie, residents armed with shovels worked to dig out vehicles or clear driveways, even as the snow continued to fall around them. </p><p>Jeremy Hodges had spent about an hour chipping away at the snow around his car, but with little progress to show for it. Shaking his head, he said, “I don’t think it’s going to happen today.”</p><p>In Buffalo, officials for the Bills <a href="https://x.com/BuffaloBills/status/1862585596390043814" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recruited</a> fans to shovel snow ahead of the team’s game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. In exchange, they offered $20 per hour, along with hot drinks and food. (And shovels were provided, of course.) </p><p>As many people hunkered down, some tried to brave the snow, only to quickly turn around. But some people capitalized on the snow, going sledding or just viewing it as a winter adventure.</p><p>Robert Warner, a manager of an Irish pub in Buffalo, said the storm would actually help his business. Asked if it might prompt him to close the pub, he said: “Lord, no! If anything, we’ll be busier.”</p><p>Kara Murphy<!-- -->, <!-- -->Daniel McGraw<!-- -->, <!-- -->Emmett Lindner<!-- --> and <!-- -->Cole Louison<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Kate Selig is a Times national reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-selig">More about Kate Selig</a></span></p></div><div><p>Isabelle Taft is a reporter covering national news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabelle-taft">More about Isabelle Taft</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/nyregion">New York</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Weather Coverage</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Extreme Weather Maps: </strong>Track the possibility of extreme weather <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/extreme-weather-forecast-maps.html">in the places that are important to you</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snow Predictions: </strong>How much snow will fall where you live? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/upshot/snow-forecast-totals-lookup.html">See the full range of possibilities in the next few days</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freezing Temperatures: </strong>A blast of Arctic air can be dangerous, especially when combined with blustery winds. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/freezing-temperatures-cold-weather-map.html">Track cold weather in the United States here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>On the Road:</strong> Safety experts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/snowstorm-car-safety-tips.html">shared some advice</a> on how snow-stranded drivers caught in a snowstorm can keep warm and collected.
