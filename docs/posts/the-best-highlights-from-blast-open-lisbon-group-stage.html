    <h1>The best highlights from BLAST Open Lisbon group stage</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Today, the administration is going after pro-Palestinian speech, but tomorrow it can go after speech criticizing fossil fuels, speech promoting D.E.I. or speech defending gender-affirming care,” said Ramya Krishnan, a senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, which is representing the professors in the lawsuit.</p><p>“There’s really no limiting principle to the administration’s theory here, and that’s part of what’s so disturbing,” she said.</p><p>The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the American Association of University Professors, a nonprofit group focused on issues of academic freedom, and three of its chapters, at Harvard, New York University and Rutgers, as well as the nonprofit Middle East Studies Association. The Knight Institute is an independent organization that does not represent the Columbia administration.</p><p>The suit hinges on a First Amendment principle that Americans have a right not only to express ideas but also to hear them. This is being violated, it argues, as noncitizens avoid political protests, purge their social media and step back from participation in groups engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy. It is also reflected through self-censoring in the classroom, which is done to avoid attention, the suit says.</p><p>“We’ve spoken to faculty that have modified their syllabi or decided against teaching entire courses out of fear that teaching certain material could put a target on their backs,” Ms. Krishnan said.</p></div></div>
