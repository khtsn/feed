His predecessor, Michel Barnier was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html" title="">toppled along with his government by a no-confidence vote</a> last week and forced to resign after just three months in office, breaking a record for the shortest-tenured government in modern French history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Bayrou’s chances of surviving longer than that are unclear. To do so, he must avoid a no-confidence motion supported by the left and by the far-right. That unusual pairing brought down Mr. Barnier, and their reactions to his appointment were closely scrutinized.</p><p>Jordan Bardella, the president of the nationalist, anti-immigrant far-right <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/europe/france-national-rally-rebranding.html" title="">National Rally party</a>, said that it was waiting to see how the new government would proceed.</p><p>“Our red lines remain,” Mr. Bardella told reporters in Paris. “The ball is now in François Bayrou’s court.”</p><p>The reaction from the New Popular Front, an alliance of left-wing parties, revealed a lack of consensus. </p><p>Representatives of France Unbowed, a leftist party that is one of the alliance’s main drivers, immediately rejected Mr. Bayrou as an extension of Mr. Macron and his pro-business policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The country has two clear choices: continuing ill-fated policies with François Bayrou, or making a clean break,” Mathilde Panot, a top lawmaker for France Unbowed, <a href="https://x.com/MathildePanot/status/1867536249063625044" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> as she called for a no-confidence vote against Mr. Bayrou.</p><p>Some of Mr. Macron’s opponents, including France Unbowed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/europe/frances-marine-le-pen-takes-aim-at-the-top.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">have been calling for his resignation</a>, placing the blame for the political deadlock on his decision over the summer to call a snap election. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/europe/macron-france-prime-minister.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">rebuffed</a> those calls.</p><p>Other members of the New Popular Front were more measured in their reactions to Mr. Bayrou’s appointment.</p><p>Fabien Roussel, the head of the Communist Party, told BFMTV that appointing a key ally of Mr. Macron was a “bad signal.” But, he said, he was waiting to see whether Mr. Bayrou would compromise with other parties and refrain from pushing bills through without a final vote, like Mr. Barnier did. </p><p>Mr. Macron is under enormous pressure as France wrestles with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">ballooning debt and a large defici</a>t that have become among the highest in Europe. The interest on the debt alone soaks up 60 billion euros — the same as the country’s spending on defense, Mr. Barnier noted before he resigned, warning of an even darker economic future if the country didn’t start taking actions to lower its debt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Bayrou, 73, is <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/iht/2007/03/21/world/IHT-21globalist.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">a fixture of French politics</a> — a former lawmaker and three-time presidential candidate who is a very familiar face for the French. He is the longtime mayor of Pau, in southwestern France, and he was education minister in the 1990s.</p><p>He is also one of the president’s oldest allies and is at the head of the Mouvement Démocrate, or MoDem, a centrist party that is part of a coalition alongside Mr. Macron’s Renaissance party.</p><p>Mr. Bayrou’s career long predates Mr. Macron’s and he has been <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/je-n-entrerai-pas-au-gouvernement-faute-d-accord-profond-sur-la-politique-a-suivre-declare-francois-bayrou-20240207" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critical</a> of him in the past, but their closeness could leave Mr. Bayrou vulnerable to a similar fate as Mr. Barnier.</p><p>Mr. Barnier, a veteran center-right politician, lost a no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament this month after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/europe/france-budget-no-confidence-vote.html" title="">pushed a budget bill</a> through without a final vote.</p><p>“The more the president loses ground, the more he clings to those closest to him,” Marine Tondelier, the head of France’s Green party, told BFMTV.<span>  </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In France, the prime minister and cabinet are in charge of drawing up a budget for parliamentary approval. Mr. Bayrou will have to work with a bitterly divided lower house of Parliament, in which no party or bloc has a majority and few are inclined to work together.</p><p>The left and the National Rally had railed against Mr. Barnier’s proposals to save $60 billion of government spending. Those proposals were a mix of cuts and tax increases that Mr. Barnier had argued were necessary to start to bring the debt and deficit under control.</p><p>One of the Barnier government’s last proposals was an emergency finance bill that is designed to avoid a government shutdown.</p><p>The emergency finance bill — only the second since 1958 — essentially reapplies the 2024 budget, allowing the government to continue to collect taxes at their current level and to borrow money on financial markets. </p><p>Civil servants would be paid and state institutions would continue to function, but no investments could be made and no steps could be taken to address the country’s fiscal condition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Political parties, even those opposed to Mr. Macron, have suggested that they would support the emergency bill to prevent a calamitous budget crunch.</p><p>But Mr. Bayrou will still have to push through an actual budget bill for 2025 — and he will face the same political headwinds as Mr. Barnier.</p><p>In some ways, Mr. Bayrou might be a more tolerable choice for Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party — in the short-term, at least.</p><p>Mr. Bayrou, like Ms. Le Pen, supports changing France’s parliamentary voting system to a proportional one.</p><p>And Mr. Bayrou, at the start of Mr. Macron’s presidency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/world/europe/france-francois-bayrou-macron.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">resigned</a> after a brief term as justice minister in 2017 over accusations that he and his party had misused European Union funds to pay aides who were actually doing work for the party. Those are charges that Ms. Le Pen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/le-pen-eu-france-embezzlement-trial.html" title="">is currently facing</a>.</p><p>Mr. Bayrou was <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20240205-french-centrist-leader-francois-bayrou-cleared-of-misusing-public-funds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cleared</a> of wrongdoing in February, but his party was convicted.
