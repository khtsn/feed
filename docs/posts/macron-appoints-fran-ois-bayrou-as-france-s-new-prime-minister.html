His predecessor, Michel Barnier was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/europe/france-no-confidence-barnier.html" title="">toppled along with his government by a no-confidence vote</a> last week and forced to resign after just three months in office, breaking a record for the shortest-tenured government in modern French history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Bayrou’s chances of surviving longer than that are unclear.
