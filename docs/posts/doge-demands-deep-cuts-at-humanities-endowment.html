Since then, a team including staff members from the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk’s government restructuring effort, have made several visits to the N.E.H. office.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, managers told staff members that DOGE had recommended reductions in staff of as much as 70 to 80 percent (of approximately 180 people), as well as what could amount to a cancellation of all grants made under the Biden administration that have not been fully paid out, according to three staff members. Senior leadership, employees were told, would develop more detailed plans for what the cuts would look like in practice.</p><p>A spokesman for the N.E.H. did not respond to a request for comment. The agency is currently led by an interim director, Michael McDonald, who is its general counsel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The N.E.H. was founded in 1965, under the same legislation as the National Endowment for the Arts. Since then, it has awarded more than $6 billion in grants to museums, historical sites, universities, libraries and other organizations, <a href="https://www.neh.gov/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to its website</a>. Last year, its budget was $211 million.</p><p>The endowment supports a variety of projects through direct grants. The most recent round, announced in January and totaling $26.6 million, included $175,000 for oral history projects connected to the Lahaina wildfire in Hawaii; $300,000 for digitization efforts at the Louis Armstrong House Museum in Queens; and $150,000 for a study of online language learning at the Yiddish Book Center in Massachusetts.</p><p>But it is also particularly important for the survival of state humanities councils, many of which derive all or most of their support from the 40 percent of the N.E.H. program funds that are <a href="https://www.neh.gov/impact/states" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">channeled directly to</a> them.</p><p>In a statement issued on Tuesday, the National Humanities Alliance — an umbrella group of universities, museums, state councils and cultural organizations — said it was dismayed at the targeting of the only entity, federal or private, charged with making the humanities accessible to everyone.</p><p>“DOGE is targeting a small federal agency that — with an annual appropriation that barely amounts to a rounding error in the U.S. budget — has a positive impact on every congressional district,” the <a href="https://nhalliance.org/nha-statement-neh-doge-threats/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The moves at the N.E.H. came a day after all employees at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, another independent federal agency, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/arts/design/library-agency-trump-museums.html" title="">put on administrative leave</a>, setting the stage for a potential shutdown. That development drew widespread condemnation from public library supporters in particular, who noted that the agency, which has an annual budget of roughly $290 million, provided a third to half of the budgets of many state library boards.</p><p>It remains unclear whether there will be similar cuts at the National Endowment for the Arts. In February, the N.E.A. announced that it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/arts/national-endowment-for-the-arts-trump.html" title="">ending a small grant program</a> aimed at projects for underserved groups and communities, though its larger general grant program, available to groups of all kinds, would continue.</p><p>A spokesman for the N.E.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jennifer Schuessler is a reporter for the Culture section of The Times who covers intellectual life and the world of ideas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jennifer-schuessler">More about Jennifer Schuessler</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Executive Order on Elections:</strong> Nearly every arm of the Democratic Party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/trump-executive-order-elections-lawsuit.html">united in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration</a>, arguing that a recent executive order seeking to require documentary proof of citizenship and other voting reforms is unconstitutional.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness Standards for Combat Roles:</strong> Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, mandated that physical fitness requirements for combat jobs be “sex-neutral,” a move that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/hegseth-fitness-standards-military-combat-roles.html">likely to significantly reduce the number of women who qualify</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Move It Back to the States’:</strong> President Trump justifies his plan to shutter the Education Department by saying that states should control schools. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trumps-education-back-to-the-states.html">He’s using the mantra for other policies, too</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Immigration Law and Congressional Limits:</strong> A crackdown targeting foreign students protesting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-deportations-students-campus-protests.html">conflicts with free-speech protections</a> that lawmakers added in 1990.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Next Law Firm Target:</strong> The law firm that employs Doug Emhoff, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s husband, has learned that it is among the next firms that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-law-firm-doug-emhoff-wilkie-farr-gallagher.html">Trump plans to use his power to punish</a>, according to four people briefed on the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Targeting Federal Agencies:</strong> The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has appeared at agency after agency to slash spending and cut the federal work force. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/27/us/politics/doge-playbook-musk-cuts.html">Here’s how DOGE employees do it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The Trump administration detailed its plans to put the government’s main agency for distributing foreign aid fully under the State Department and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/usaid-trump-doge-cuts.html">reduce its staff to some 15 legally required positions</a>.
