Caden, who had just started his junior year at the private school, was also a member of <a href="https://www.selmatimesjournal.com/2024/05/03/morgan-academy-falls-in-aisa-baseball-regionals/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the school’s baseball team</a> and was selected last year to participate in a leadership academy at the University of Alabama, <a href="https://www.selmatimesjournal.com/2024/02/27/morgan-academy-trio-picked-for-alabama-leadership-academy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Selma Times-Journal</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Relatives of Caden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Friday’s game was the first for Jacob Webb, the new football coach and athletic director who was hired in May. In an interview with the <a href="https://www.blackbeltnewsnetwork.com/news/dallascounty/morgan-academy-set-to-open-football-season-with-new-coach-against-southern-at-home/article_d7b15554-6143-11ef-901b-677aadb485b8.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black Belt News Network</a> ahead of the game, Webb said he expected Caden to be a leader on the team in the upcoming season. “Our goals this year are to get better every day,” he said. Morgan Academy finished the 2023 season 1-9.</p><p>Officials paused the game while Caden was treated and resumed play after he was taken to the hospital by ambulance from the field, <a href="https://www.selmatimesjournal.com/2024/08/24/johnsons-big-night-powers-morgan-academy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Selma Times-Journal reported</a>. Morgan Academy went on to win the game, 30-22.</p><p>The National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research <a href="https://nccsir.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5614/2024/02/Annual-Football-2023-Fatalities-FINAL-WEB.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported 16 deaths of football players in 2023</a> across college, high school, middle school and youth leagues, three of which were traumatic brain injuries, including two in high school football and one in a youth league. All three of those deaths happened during games. The others were attributed to other medical conditions including heat stroke, cardiac arrest or a pulmonary embolism.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumatic-brain-injury/data-research/comparing-head-impacts/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Two studies</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021 found that tackle football athletes sustained more head impacts than flag football athletes.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
