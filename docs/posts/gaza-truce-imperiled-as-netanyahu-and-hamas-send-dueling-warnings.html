Another hurdle looms in March, when the cease-fire is set to elapse unless Hamas and Israel negotiate an extension.</p><p>“The crisis is a prelude for a much bigger crisis that is coming in early March,” said Ibrahim Dalalsha, the director of the Horizon Center, a political research group in the West Bank of Ramallah.</p><p>Mr. Trump repeated his ultimatum on freeing the remaining hostages while meeting on Tuesday with King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House. “They either have them out by Saturday at 12 p.m. or all bets are off,” the president said.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s pronouncements this week — including his statements that the United States will take over the devastated territory and that its Palestinian residents have no rights to return — have infuriated Hamas, flummoxed world leaders and amplified the sense of chaos surrounding the cease-fire negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>King Abdullah II of Jordan met with President Trump at the White House on Tuesday and said his country was willing to take in 2,000 sick Palestinian children.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Trump has said the United States will rebuild Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” and on Monday he threatened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-jordan-egypt-gaza-development.html" title="">withdraw financial support for Egypt and Jordan</a> unless they take in all the Palestinians who would be displaced by that effort.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The president has said he would “make a deal” with Jordan and Egypt to take in the Palestinians — a move that would destabilize both countries and that has been flatly rejected by their leaders. During his meeting with King Abdullah on Tuesday, Mr. Trump insisted that the United States had the authority to “take” Gaza and that other countries in the region would absorb the Palestinians who live there.</p><p>“We will have Gaza,” he said. “It’s a war-torn area. We’re going to take it.”</p><p>Jordan’s Parliament last week introduced a bill that would ban the resettlement of Palestinians in the country. But King Abdullah is trying to protect the more than $1.5 billion in foreign aid his country receives from the United States. He said in the meeting that Jordan was willing to take in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009984382/trump-jordan-gaza.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">2,000 Palestinian children</a> with cancer or otherwise very ill “right away.” Mr. Trump called the offer “a beautiful gesture.”</p><p>Hamas, in a statement on Tuesday, called Mr. Trump’s broader proposal of removing Gazans “ethnic cleansing.” The group added, “The plan to deport our people from Gaza will not succeed, and they will be faced with a unified Palestinian, Arab and Islamic position that rejects all displacement plans.”</p><p>The first phase of the cease-fire deal was struck last month between Israel and Hamas, and it was set to expire on March 2. Originally, three Israelis were to be freed this week in the latest hostage-for-prisoner exchange as required under the agreement. Most of the exchanges have taken place on Saturdays.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>So far, 16 of 33 Israeli hostages who were set to be released in the first phase of this cease-fire have been freed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-deal.html" title="">About 60 other hostages</a>, some of whom are believed to be dead, were to be released later this spring under a second phase of the deal.</p><p>In a video posted after a four-hour meeting with his security cabinet, Mr. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that he and his top advisers had been shocked by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-prisoners.html" title="">the emaciated appearances</a> of three Israeli men who were freed last Saturday.</p><p>“The decision I passed in the cabinet, unanimously, is this: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the cease-fire will end, and the I.D.F. will resume intense fighting until Hamas is decisively defeated,” Mr. Netanyahu said in the video, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Or Levy, one of the three Israeli hostages freed by Hamas on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>In its threat on Monday to delay the next round of hostages to be released, Hamas accused Israel of violating parts of the cease-fire agreement, including by slowing sufficient humanitarian aid in and around Gaza. Israel has denied the claim.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Hamas led the attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that started the war, killed about 1,200 people and led to the abduction of 250 others to Gaza. Israel retaliated by bombarding the territory and displacing millions of Palestinians. At least 48,000 Gazans have been killed during the fighting, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Millions of Palestinians are returning to neighborhoods in ruins.</p><p>The current standoff stems in part from Hamas’s accusation that Israel has not upheld its promises for the first phase of the cease-fire. Israel was required to send hundreds of thousands of tents into Gaza, a promise that Hamas says Israel has not kept.</p><p>Three Israeli officials and two mediators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said that Hamas’s claims were accurate. But COGAT, the Israeli military unit that oversees aid deliveries, said in a written response that Hamas’s accusations were “completely false.”</p><p>It added, “Hundreds of thousands of tents have entered Gaza since the beginning of the agreement, as well as fuel, generators and everything Israel pledged.”</p><p>Regardless, officials and commentators say the dispute can be resolved relatively easily if Israel allows more aid to Gaza. More serious, they say, is the widespread perception that Mr. Netanyahu is undermining the negotiations over an extended truce. Those talks were to begin early last week. Instead, Mr. Netanyahu delayed sending a team to Qatar, which is mediating talks, until early this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tents sheltering displaced Palestinians in a schoolyard in the north of Gaza City on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>That delegation consisted of three officials who have not previously led Israel’s negotiating effort, according to five Israeli officials and an official from one of the mediating countries. And their mandate was only to listen, not to negotiate.</p><p>That created the perception that Mr. Netanyahu was playing for time rather than trying to extend the truce. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks more freely.</p><p>Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, said that Mr. Netanyahu was “working tirelessly to return all hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization.” Mr. Dostri added that Israel would send negotiators to discuss the deal’s extension after Israel’s position had been set by the cabinet.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has often said that Hamas will not remain in power after the war. Key members of his governing coalition have expressed a wish to resume the war to oust Hamas, despite calls from much of the Israeli public and relatives of the captives for an extension of the truce to free the remaining hostages, even if it leaves the militant group in power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>A Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, said that the group’s warning on Monday had been in response mainly to the disagreements over humanitarian aid. But analysts said that it was also an attempt to force Mr. Netanyahu to negotiate earnestly and was probably a reaction to Mr. Trump’s statements about depopulating Gaza.</p><p>“There’s an anger among Hamas about the demands of both Netanyahu and Trump that Hamas will be kicked out of Gaza,” said Michael Milshtein, an Israeli analyst of Palestinian affairs.</p><p>“The announcement yesterday was a kind of a signal that, if you continue demanding this, there will be several dramatic crises,” he added.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Natan Odenheimer<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ephrat Livni<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
