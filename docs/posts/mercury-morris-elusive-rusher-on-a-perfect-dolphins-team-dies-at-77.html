He was 77.</p><p>His son Troy<span>  </span>announced the death in a statement that did not specify the cause or where Morris was at the time. </p><p>During a six-year tenure with the Dolphins, from 1969 to 1975, Morris qualified for the Pro Bowl three times. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>At the height of his career, Morris was part of an unusual three-man rushing rotation alongside the fullback Larry Csonka and another running back, Jim Kiick. Csonka and Kiick were powerful bruisers; Morris, who was born Eugene, gained his nickname from his quicksilver unpredictability on the field.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Morris in 1970. In 1973 he rushed for a league-leading 12 touchdowns.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Initially, he had been used mainly as a kick returner. He did not have a single handoff during the Dolphins’ loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the 1972 Super Bowl. Csonka and Kiick, conversely, gained such fame for their partnership on the field and their friendship off it that they were nicknamed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</p><p>The next season, Coach Don Shula made Morris an integral part of the offense. </p><p>“Merc<span>  </span>is the guy that can go into the ballgame and get you moving if you’re not moving,” Shula told reporters. </p><p>To assert his new position on the team, Morris would deliberately sit between Csonka and Kiick on the bench. Journalists began writing about Kiick’s wounded pride. Soon enough, however, he began praising Morris. </p><p>“I used to think, ‘Wow, I feel really fast on this turf,’” Kiick recalled in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2295029617298450" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Perfect Backfield,”</a> a 2014 documentary about him, Csonka and Morris. Later, he continued, “I’d go, ‘What the hell does Mercury feel like?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After quarterback Bob Griese broke his ankle in Week 5, the running game became even more important for the team. The Bills nearly beat the Dolphins in Week 6, but Morris <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article267482178.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped</a> the team win by recording two turnovers but also two touchdowns.</p><p>Behind an offensive line featuring future Hall of Famers like Larry Little and Jim Langer, the three backs proved to be unstoppable. In the regular season, the offense averaged 27.5 points a game, leading the N.F.L., and Morris rushed for a league-leading 12 touchdowns. </p><p>He and Csonka became the first two players on the same team to gain 1,000 or more rushing yards. And Kiick wound up getting plenty of touches and receptions, recording 10 touchdowns and nearly 800 yards from scrimmage.</p><p>The Dolphins won their 19th consecutive game in the 1973 Super Bowl in a game dominated by their defense, which held the Washington team, then called the Redskins, to a single touchdown.</p><p>The next season, Morris led the N.F.L. with 6.4 yards per carry, and the Dolphins were dominant again, losing just two games en route to another Super Bowl victory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Morris carries the ball during Super Bowl VIII against the Vikings.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After that, however, injuries and rival offers broke apart the team’s rushing triumvirate. Lured by a big payday, Csonka, Kiick and the wide receiver Paul Warfield left the Dolphins to play for the newly formed World Football League. When that endeavor flopped, all three players returned to different N.F.L. teams.</p><p>Morris gained the chance to be the Dolphins’ premier running back. But a series of injuries, particularly an old neck injury, thwarted him in the next few seasons. He left the Dolphins after the 1975 season, spent a single season with the Chargers and then quit football.</p><p>To cope with severe headaches, Morris began using drugs. In 1982 he returned to the national news, not for football but instead for being convicted of several charges related to cocaine trafficking. The conviction was later overturned, and Morris spent years working to clear his name.</p><p>Eugene Edward Morris was born in Pittsburgh on Jan. 5, 1947. He grew up playing touch football in a friend’s backyard. In “The Perfect Backfield,” he said he never lost the sense that the goal of football was for nobody to be able to touch you.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As a running back at West Texas State, Morris vied with O.J. Simpson — like Kiick, a rival who became a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/longtime-friend-mercury-morris-fond-memories-made-no-judgment-oj-simpson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">friend</a> — for the national college rushing title.</p><p>During his cocaine trial, Morris cried on the witness stand while telling the jury that he took drugs to deal with the pain from football.<span>  </span>But he maintained that he was never a<span>  </span>cocaine trafficker and that he was a victim of entrapment.</p><p>After serving three and a half<span>  </span>years in prison, he won a new trial and agreed to a settlement for the time he had already served. He began a lucrative career as a public speaker. </p><p>In addition to Troy, his survivors include four other children, Geno, Maceo, Tiffany and Elliott, and three sisters, Cynthia, Valerie and Janice.</p><p>In 2022, Morris described Kiick’s struggles with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, also known as C.T.E., to The New York Times. He said that he had to coax Kiick out of his car and direct him to an airport terminal to bring him to the filming of “The Perfect Backfield.” But even when Kiick’s dementia became severe, Morris continued seeing him about every week.</p><p>Ken Belson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Traub works on the Obituaries desk and occasionally reports on New York City for other sections of the paper.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alex-traub">More about Alex Traub</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
