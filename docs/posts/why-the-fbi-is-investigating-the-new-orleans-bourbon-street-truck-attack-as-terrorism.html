The mayor of New Orleans at first said it was, but a local F.B.I. official countered that it was not. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and F.B.I. officials in Washington then said they were in fact investigating the incident as terrorism.</p><p>In the attack, a man drove a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year’s revelers on Bourbon Street around 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday. Multiple officials on Wednesday identified the suspect as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, 42.</p><p>F.B.I. officials, who are typically cautious in public statements until investigators can gather more evidence about a suspect’s intentions, said on Wednesday that as law enforcement officials learned more — particularly about the discovery of a cooler containing an improvised bomb next to the suspect’s vehicle — they became more certain it was a terror attack. The combination of a truck used as a weapon, along with the bomb, led investigators to believe that the perpetrator’s goal was to cause additional casualties on civilians.</p><p>Many elected officials and member of the public think of terrorism primarily as a method of violence, such as using a vehicle, gun, or bomb to kill random civilians on a street. To investigators and prosecutors, however, motive or ideology is an important part of defining terrorism.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
