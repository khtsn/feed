He was 76.</p><p>His death was confirmed by his manager, Geoff Cheddy, who did not specify a cause.</p><p>Over more than four decades, Mr. Wendt racked up about 170 film and television credits. But he was best known for “Cheers.” He appeared on every episode of the sitcom during its 11-year run on NBC, which began in 1982. His streak of Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series began in 1984.</p><p>Mr. Wendt, a native of the South Side of Chicago, started his entertainment career in inglorious fashion, <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2013/09/15/george-wendt-in-auburn-production/2817837/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sweeping the floors</a> at the Second City, the famed improvisational comedy club in his hometown that helped launched the careers of generations of stars, including John Belushi, Mike Myers, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.</p><p>In 1974, he became part of the Second City’s touring production and resident company. “I had <a href="https://subscribe.democratandchronicle.com/restricted?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fstory%2Flifestyle%2F2013%2F09%2F15%2Fgeorge-wendt-in-auburn-production%2F2817837%2F&amp;gps-source=CPROADBLOCKDH&amp;itm_source=roadblock&amp;itm_medium=onsite&amp;itm_campaign=premiumroadblock&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z118275e002400v118275b0092xxd119265&amp;gca-ft=101&amp;gca-ds=sophi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no acting experience</a> in my background,” he said in a 2013 interview with The Democrat and Chronicle newspaper of Rochester, N.Y., “but something just clicked.” He remained with the company until 1980.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>With his easy charm and lunch-pail demeanor, Mr. Wendt headed for Hollywood to appear in the pilot for an NBC show called “Nothing but Comedy․” He later popped up on popular television shows like “Taxi,” “Alice” and “Hart to Hart” before becoming one of America’s favorite barflies on “Cheers.”</p><p>He later said that his pronounced girth was key to the role, making Norm the relatable guy that viewers would feel like sidling up next to at their neighborhood bar.</p><p>“One nice thing about being fat for a living is that you don’t worry about losing weight or dieting,” Mr. Wendt once said. “I don’t know how much I’d have to lose before it was noticeable. Anyhow, if I lost 100 pounds people would say, ‘Oh, no, not another fat comedian wanting to be a leading man!’”</p><p>While the Norm character felt natural to who he was, he said, there were definitely differences between fiction and reality.</p><p>“The Norm you see in ‘Cheers’ has been years in the making,” he said. “I have some characteristics in common with him besides our fondness for beer. But I think I’m a lot happier than Norm.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He added: “I was a beer drinker long before ‘Cheers.’ When I put a couple of six packs on top of my grocery shopping cart, people are pleased. I tell ’em I’m taking them home to rehearse.”</p><p><em>A complete obituary will be published soon.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Williams is a Times reporter on the Obituaries desk.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
