By highlighting the project, Mr. Biden is trying to cement efforts to expand American access to the critical resources in Africa and, in effect, compete with China’s growing influence on the continent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Despite the Biden administration’s friendly appeals, however, the United States still lags behind China and Russia in competing for economic and security influence in Africa, according to foreign policy experts.</p><p>“A dirty little secret, ever since we disengaged with post-colonial Africa: It has been our lowest priority,” said Tibor P. Nagy Jr., <a href="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/nagy-tibor-p" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who was appointed</a> by President Bill Clinton twice to serve as an ambassador in Africa and then by the Trump administration to serve as assistant secretary of state for African affairs. “You have some administrations like this one, that come out with grandiose African strategies that are absolutely aspirational. But it is like the old advertisement: Where is the beef?​”</p><p>As proof of his administration’s commitment, Mr. Biden is expected to announce <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/12/01/background-press-call-on-the-presidents-travel-to-angola/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a variety of investments</a> in global health, agriculture and security cooperation during the trip. He will celebrate a U.S. government initiative that has connected American and Angolan businesses for deals totaling $6.9 billion. But the life span of such commitments will also hinge on the will of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who once disparaged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/trump-shithole-countries.html" title="">African nations with an expletive.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/africa/angola-biden-lourenco-trump.html" title="">In an interview with The New York Times</a>, President João Lourenço of Angola said he was not concerned about the change of administrations in the United States.</p><p>“We don’t need to make any speculation for now,” Mr. Lourenço said. “So we cannot judge him on what he said, but we will judge him on what he will do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Biden will make a brief stop on Monday in Cape Verde, where he will meet with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and express his gratitude for the nation’s support of Ukraine in its fight against Russia, according to U.S. officials.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Biden will go to the National Slavery Museum near the Angolan capital, Luanda, to highlight how the relationship between the two nations originates in the slave trade. Historians believe that people from Angola accounted for among the largest numbers of enslaved Africans shipped to the United States, including the first to arrive at Point Comfort, Va., in 1619.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s visit should bolster Mr. Lourenço’s efforts to build a global tourism campaign centered on that history. Mr. Biden is planning to endorse the Angola government’s application to declare the Cuanza River corridor, where enslaved people were taken, a UNESCO World Heritage site, according to administration officials. Mr. Biden will also speak about the promising future between the United States and Angola, which was once a Cold War rival.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Biden will tour the Lobito Corridor, which his aides maintain is not just a means of expanding U.S. access to critical minerals but also a way for Angolan farmers to reach markets in neighboring nations and effectively expand food security in the region.</p><p>But in Angola, some residents said they were torn between the reality of China’s ubiquitous presence and the less visible investment of the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Working at a cellphone kiosk in China City — a Chinese-built shopping complex in Luanda that extends for several blocks — Dalia Javela, 25, counted her job as one of the advantages of Beijing’s presence.</p><p>“I think the Chinese came to help,” Ms. Javela said.</p><p>She had never met anyone from the United States and did not know what, if any, involvement the country had in Angola. Yet she had caught wind that Mr. Biden was coming to visit.</p><p>“At least he will be able to see how we live,” Ms. Javela said. “Our way of life.”</p><p>Antonio Andrade, a deputy administrator for Cubal, an agricultural town about two hours from Benguela that is along the Lobito Corridor, said he hoped the attention from Mr. Biden would encourage more nations to work with Angola. But he questioned why it had taken so long for Angola to be prioritized.</p><p>“We should have had this partnership before with U.S.A.,” Mr. Andrade said. “A stronger partnership for all the reasons that we know.”</p><p>Eric Lipton<!-- --> and <!-- -->Peter Baker<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, and <!-- -->John Eligon<!-- --> from Luanda and Cubal, Angola.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/joao-lourenco">João Lourenço</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>One Superpower, Two Presidents: </strong>Even as President Biden brokers a Middle East cease-fire to cap his tenure, President-elect Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/biden-trump-foreign-policy.html">running his own foreign policy without waiting to be sworn in</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Antitrust Investigation Into Microsoft: </strong>The F.T.C. opened an investigation into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/technology/microsoft-ftc-antitrust.html">whether Microsoft has violated antitrust law</a> in multiple segments of its business, the latest salvo in a battle by the government to rein in tech companies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cutting Intel’s Chip Award: </strong>The Silicon Valley company will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/economy/intel-chips-award-biden.html">receive less money from the CHIPS Act</a> after winning a $3 billion military contract and changing some of its investment commitments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obesity Drugs: </strong>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/upshot/obesity-drugs-medicare-medicaid.html">proposed that Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity medications</a>, a costly and probably popular move that the Trump administration would need to endorse to become official.</p></li><li><p><strong>Electric Vehicles: </strong>The Biden administration will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/biden-loans-ev-auto-industry.html">lend $6 billion to help Rivian build an electric car factory</a> in Georgia, part of an effort to lock in Democratic climate policies before Trump takes office.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
