Trump hopscotched the battleground states on Wednesday as they sought to wring support from an electorate already in the full throes of early voting.</p><p>Both candidates began their day with rallies in North Carolina and plan to end it with events in Wisconsin, with Ms. Harris adding a stop in between in Pennsylvania, a signal about which states remain most competitive as Election Day nears.</p><p>While Ms. Harris offered a message of unity and pledged to be “a president for all Americans,” Mr. Trump sought to amplify a muddled remark from President Biden in which he appeared to call Mr. Trump’s supporters “garbage.”</p><p>Before a crowd of thousands packed into a rather pungent agricultural exposition center in Harrisburg, Pa., Ms. Harris offered herself as a president who would recruit competing voices into her White House and not, as Mr. Trump has done, cast them as the nation’s enemies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy from within,” she said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at the table.”</p><p>White House aides suggested Mr. Biden’s remark was a verbal slip from the octogenarian president. Mr. Trump and his allies pounced, seeing an opening to capitalize on their supporters’ outrage and to tie Ms. Harris with Mr. Biden.</p><p>In Rocky Mount, N.C., Mr. Trump said Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, had demeaned his supporters, telling a rally crowd that “you can’t be president if you hate the American people, and there’s a lot of hatred there.”</p><p>By then, Ms. Harris had already sought to separate herself from Mr. Biden.</p><p>“Let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” she told reporters as she prepared to board Air Force Two outside Washington, although she pointed out that Mr. Biden had “clarified his comments.”</p><p>The vice president made no reference to Mr. Biden’s remarks at two of her three stops on Wednesday in Harrisburg and Raleigh, N.C.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Harris has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/harris-biden-campaign.html" title="">pressed to distance herself</a> more broadly from Mr. Biden, an unpopular incumbent who is also her boss, putting her in a difficult position. Her campaign has resisted having them appear together on the trail. Mr. Biden is seen as an undisciplined communicator, and his comments on Tuesday undercut a speech Ms. Harris delivered that same night in which she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/harris-speech-ellipse-trump.html" title="">made unity a major theme</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Ms. Harris delivered her closing argument speech at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House, intentionally standing where Mr. Trump had given a speech almost four years earlier when he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and sparked a violent insurrection.</p><p>Ms. Harris cast her rival as a “petty tyrant” and a person “consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power” while presenting herself as a fighter who would usher in a new generation of leadership and unite the nation.</p><p>“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” she said, pointing back to the White House behind her. “On Day 1, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In her Raleigh speech, Ms. Harris emphasized a message of unity as her campaign reaches out to moderates and independents.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In what may be this election’s closest thing to an “October surprise,” a comedian’s racist jokes at a Trump rally on Sunday have been reshuffling the messaging from each campaign and supplying the Trump campaign with a new fund-raising tactic. In a sign of how much the controversy may have broken through to the public, Google searches on Monday for the name of the comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, surpassed those for Taylor Swift, one of the world’s most famous musicians.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Sunday, Mr. Hinchcliffe made a joke onstage that disparaged Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Mr. Biden tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/biden-garbage-trump-supporters.html" title="">denounce</a> that racist language in a video call with Hispanic supporters on Tuesday night. But he garbled his words, saying: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”</p><p>The White House and Mr. Biden <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1851436643498037614" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later said</a> he was describing the racist language as “garbage,” not Trump supporters.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who planned to end his Monday schedule with a rally in Green Bay, Wis., unleashed a torrent of criticism, joined by his allies.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Biden’s remarks went viral on social media, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida came onstage at Mr. Trump’s rally in Allentown, Pa., on Tuesday night and relayed the president’s remarks to the crowd, amid a chorus of boos. The Trump campaign quickly tried to tie Mr. Biden’s comments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/biden-trump-supporters-garbage-reaction.html" title="">to Hillary Clinton calling some Trump supporters “deplorables”</a> in 2016 and sent out fund-raising messages referring to the controversy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly demonized Democrats, describing them at times as “the enemy within,” “communists,” “these lunatics” and “radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.”</p><p>But on Wednesday at the Rocky Mount rally, he insisted that it was the rhetoric from the Democratic side that was the problem. “For the past nine years, Kamala and her party have called us racists, bigots, fascists, deplorables, irredeemables, Nazis and they’ve called me Hitler,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “They’ve demeaned us. They’ve demonized us and censored us.”</p><p>Polls in North Carolina show a race that is virtually tied, as is true across the seven battleground states and the nation as a whole. Ms. Harris is to hold a rally Wednesday night in Madison, Wis., with the musicians Gracie Abrams, Mumford &amp; Sons and others set to open for her.</p><p>Across the seven battleground states, about 36 percent of registered voters have already cast ballots, according to early voting data reviewed by The New York Times. The early voting rates vary wildly by state. More than half of North Carolina’s voters have cast ballots, but just 19 percent of Pennsylvania’s have done so, reflecting cultural voting patterns and ease of voting.</p><p>The early-voting rates are helping determine where the campaigns hold rallies in the final days of the race. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee County’s early voting rate has lagged behind the rest of the state, prompting the Harris campaign to plan a Friday night event in Milwaukee with a to-be-announced musical act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump made his first stop on Wednesday in Rocky Mount, an impoverished section of northeastern North Carolina, where Barack Obama energized Black voters on his way to winning the state in 2008, the last Democratic presidential nominee to do so.</p><p>On the road to the event, Mr. Trump saw a very different scene from the one that greeted him on Tuesday in the Philadelphia suburb of Drexel Hill, Pa., where people wearing Trump gear lined the streets, cheering him and waving giant flags bearing his name.</p><p>In Rocky Mount, as Mr. Trump’s motorcade drove by, young African American residents stood on their front lawns in front of small houses. Some silently filmed the procession; one man stood on his porch and raised his middle finger.</p><p>But the arena, the Rocky Mount Event Center, which seats up to 4,000 people, was filled near to capacity with mostly white Trump fans.</p><p>Jazmine Ulloa<!-- --> contributed reporting from Charlotte, N.C., and <!-- -->Katie Rogers<!-- --> from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Times political reporter covering the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Reid J.
