Trump clashed for support on Wednesday in the battleground state of North Carolina, holding competing rallies roughly 50 miles apart a day after President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters “garbage.”</p><p>In Rocky Mount, Mr. Trump expressed outrage over Mr. Biden’s remark, telling a rally crowd that “you can’t be president if you hate the American people, and there’s a lot of hatred there.”</p><p>In Raleigh, Ms. Harris made no mention of Mr. Biden’s comments, instead emphasizing a message of unity as her campaign reaches out to moderate Republicans and independents, particularly women. She was introduced onstage by a former Republican voter who supported Mr. Trump in 2016.</p><p>“Here is my pledge to you as your president,” Ms. Harris told the crowd. “I pledge to seek common ground and common-sense solutions to the challenges you face. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She added: “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at the table.”</p><p>Earlier in the day, Ms. Harris had tried to separate herself from Mr. Biden. “Let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” Ms. Harris told reporters as she prepared to board Air Force Two outside Washington, although she pointed out that Mr. Biden had “clarified his comments.”</p><p>Ms. Harris has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/harris-biden-campaign.html" title="">pressed to distance herself</a> more broadly from Mr. Biden, an unpopular incumbent who is also her boss, putting her in a difficult position. Her campaign has resisted having them appear together on the trail. Mr. Biden is seen as an undisciplined communicator, and his comments on Tuesday undercut a speech Ms. Harris delivered that same night in which she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/harris-speech-ellipse-trump.html" title="">made unity a major theme</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Ms. Harris delivered her closing argument speech at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House, intentionally standing where Mr. Trump had given a speech almost four years earlier when he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and sparked a violent insurrection.</p><p>Ms. Harris cast her rival as a “petty tyrant” and a person “consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power” while presenting herself as a fighter who would usher in a new generation of leadership and unite the nation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” she said, pointing back to the White House behind her. “On Day 1, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In her Raleigh speech, Ms. Harris emphasized a message of unity as her campaign reaches out to moderates and independents.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In what may be this election’s closest thing to an “October surprise,” a comedian’s racist jokes at a Trump rally on Sunday have been reshuffling the messaging from each campaign and supplying the Trump campaign with a new fund-raising tactic. In a sign of how much the controversy may have broken through to the public, Google searches on Monday for the name of the comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, surpassed those for Taylor Swift, one of the world’s most famous musicians.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Hinchcliffe made a joke onstage that disparaged Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Mr. Biden tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/biden-garbage-trump-supporters.html" title="">denounce</a> that racist language in a video call with Hispanic supporters on Tuesday night. But he garbled his words, saying: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”</p><p>The White House and Mr. Biden <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1851436643498037614" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later said</a> he was describing the racist language as “garbage,” not Trump supporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump and his allies unleashed a torrent of criticism.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Biden’s remarks went viral on social media, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida came onstage at Mr. Trump’s rally in Allentown, Pa., on Tuesday night and relayed the president’s remarks to the crowd, amid a chorus of boos. The Trump campaign quickly tried to tie Mr. Biden’s comments <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/biden-trump-supporters-garbage-reaction.html" title="">to Hillary Clinton calling some Trump supporters “deplorables”</a> in 2016 and sent out fund-raising messages referring to the controversy.</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly demonized Democrats, describing them at times as “the enemy within,” “communists,” “these lunatics” and “radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.”</p><p>But on Wednesday at the Rocky Mount rally, he insisted that it was the rhetoric from the Democratic side that was the problem. “For the past nine years, Kamala and her party have called us racists, bigots, fascists, deplorables, irredeemables, Nazis and they’ve called me Hitler,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “They’ve demeaned us. They’ve demonized us and censored us.”</p><p>Polls in North Carolina show a race that is virtually tied, as is true across the seven battleground states and the nation as a whole.<span>  </span>Later on Wednesday, Ms. Harris will hold a rally in Pennsylvania. In the evening, both she and Mr. Trump will rally in Wisconsin, underscoring how both campaigns are competing for a narrow slice of undecided voters in the battleground states who could decide the election.</p><p>Across the seven battleground states, about 35 percent of registered voters have already cast ballots, according to early voting data reviewed by The New York Times. The early voting rates vary wildly by state. More than half of North Carolina’s voters have cast ballots, but just 17 percent of Pennsylvania’s have done so, reflecting cultural voting patterns and ease of voting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump made his first stop on Wednesday in Rocky Mount, an impoverished section of northeastern North Carolina, where Barack Obama energized Black voters on his way to winning the state in 2008, the last Democratic presidential nominee to do so.</p><p>On the road to the event, Mr. Trump saw a very different scene from the one that greeted him on Tuesday in the Philadelphia suburb of Drexel Hill, Pa., where people wearing Trump gear lined the streets, cheering him and waving giant flags bearing his name.</p><p>In Rocky Mount, as Mr. Trump’s motorcade drove by, young African American residents stood on their front lawns in front of small houses. Some silently filmed the procession; one man stood on his porch and raised his middle finger.</p><p>But the arena, the Rocky Mount Event Center, which seats up to 4,000 people, was filled near to capacity with mostly white Trump fans.</p><p>Jazmine Ulloa<!-- --> contributed reporting from Charlotte, N.C., and <!-- -->Katie Rogers<!-- --> from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Times political reporter covering the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Reid J.
