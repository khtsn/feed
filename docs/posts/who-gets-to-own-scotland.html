After the Campbells sold it in 1922 to pay off gambling debts, it served as a hotel, a World War II hospital, a training site for nuclear war preparations and a drama school.</p><p>In more recent decades, a string of private buyers tried and failed to restore the estate, usually running out of money and leaving it to fall further into decay. But locals and visitors were still free to walk its idyllic grounds, thanks largely to a 2003 land-reform law that enshrined the public’s “right to roam” Scotland’s majestic landscapes without interference from private landowners. The tourism dollars they brought were good for the village of Kenmore, a short walk from the castle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/00SCOTLAND-Taymouth-ghlj/00SCOTLAND-Taymouth-ghlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/00SCOTLAND-Taymouth-ghlj/00SCOTLAND-Taymouth-ghlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/21/multimedia/00SCOTLAND-Taymouth-ghlj/00SCOTLAND-Taymouth-ghlj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A castle stands in a grassy field with a tree-covered mountain in the background.

There were fears about the potential impact on the environment and on local housing costs, not to mention the possibility that the new owners would cut off public access to the land. A petition launched by a group called <a href="https://www.change.org/p/protect-loch-tay" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Protect Loch Tay</a> urging Scots to sign before “we have lost our stunning natural heritage in this area forever” drew more than 160,000 signatures.</p><p>In a country known for its majestic scenery, there are conflicting ideas — as well as a new land-reform bill making its way through Scotland’s parliament — concerning what, if anything, should be done to stop wealthy buyers from engulfing the countryside.</p><p>“There’s a feeling that much of the local assets are getting sucked into this vision that the developer has,” said Mark Ruskell, a member of Scotland’s parliament whose region includes the Loch Tay area. “And that doesn’t necessarily work for the long-term sustainability of the community.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Work continues on the Taymouth Castle golf course, which first opened in 1925.

Much of the castle restoration was completed last year, including ornate details like stained-glass windows and a gold-leaf ceiling. Work is ongoing to refurbish the golf course, and 145 luxury homes have yet to be built.</p><p>All the commotion has highlighted an age-old question in Scotland: How much land is too much? According to the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/land-reform-bill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government</a>, parcels of more than 1,000 hectares (roughly 2,500 acres) represent over half of Scotland’s land, while <a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/interactive-map/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 11 percent</a> is publicly owned or managed by the Scottish Crown Estate.</p><p>“It’s probably one of the most concentrated patterns of private land ownership anywhere in the world,” said Andy Wightman, a former parliament member who now <a href="https://whoownsscotland.org.uk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracks the country’s land ownership</a>. According to his data, half of all the privately owned rural land in Scotland is controlled by 421 landowners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The village of Kenmore sits on the northeastern tip of Loch Tay, just outside the grounds of Taymouth Castle.

One of them, the Danish billionaire Anders Povlsen, is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/05/headway/scotland-peatlands-climate-change.html" title="">Scotland’s largest private landowner</a>, with more than 200,000 acres.</p><p>But the issue goes back centuries. During a period that began in the 1700s known as the Highland Clearances, wealthy landlords with huge estates evicted and relocated thousands of tenant farmers living on the land, hollowing out working communities. Though some reforms were made over the years, Scotland only abolished its feudal system of land tenure in 2000, and the dynamic has been hard to shake.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The owners of Taymouth Castle have been hosting community discussion sessions with local residents.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“We never had the sort of revolutionary moment that the French or the Irish had, which led to huge change,” said Malcolm Combe, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, adding: “Until now. We’re trying to do land reform in a kind of modern setting.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Today, concentrated land ownership “appears to be causing significant and long term damage to the communities affected,” according to <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/land-reform-scotland-bill-fairer-scotland-duty-assessment-summary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government analysis</a>, including a surge in land prices, declining population and sagging income levels among some rural residents.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/land-reform-bill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new bill</a> in parliament aims to claw back some of that land by expanding community ownership and giving more power to tenant farmers and smaller landholders. The law would give elected officials the ability to break up parcels of more than 1,000 hectares when they come up for sale, allowing more communities, farmers and small businesses the chance to buy at affordable prices. It would also force some landowners to engage local communities in their plans for the terrain.</p><p>Mr. Ruskell, the Scottish member, said that the current landholding system in some ways echoes the 19th-century model, just with corporations in place of feudal landlords. “As a result, you have communities where there’s a huge housing crisis, where it’s difficult for young people to stay in these local communities,” he said.</p><p>Chris Heasman, a writer and activist who lives just outside of Kenmore, partly blames the vestiges of feudalism for the housing issues in the area, where finding a home can be a “nightmare.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chris Heasman, a local resident, believes the new development is “going exclusively to the use of people who really, really don’t need it.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In some cases, he said, the Taymouth estate plans have “jeopardized housing further.” He pointed to one proposal to build a golf maintenance hub on land that had been carved out for affordable housing. (It was eventually withdrawn.)</p><p>“All these issues that have arisen, I’m not convinced that they are an acceptable price to pay for the castle being restored inside,” Mr. Heasman said. “Especially when the vast majority of people are not going to be able to actually enjoy the castle, or even see it.”</p><p>But others are convinced that the redevelopment of neglected treasures like Taymouth Castle, and the accompanying investment in surrounding areas, is what’s best for the local communities.</p><p>“What would you rather have: A great big blot on the landscape falling to bits, or would you like someone to do something about it?” said Shirley Shearer, a local business owner and vice chair of the Kenmore &amp; District Community Council, a group run by elected locals.</p><p>“In general, everything is looking much more affluent,” she said, adding that there’s more life in the community and a “renewed optimism” about its future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shirley Shearer, a local resident and member of the Kenmore &amp; District Community Council, said that “everything is looking much more affluent” since the Taymouth project came to Kenmore.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Discovery Land Company declined to make its leadership available for interviews, but David O’Donoghue, the hospitality and real estate development leader of Taymouth Castle, said in an email statement that the company intends to protect Kenmore, land-access rights and the local environment. It also <a href="https://www.kenmore-and-district-cc.org.uk/taymouth-castle-your-questions-answered" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has touted its intention</a> to “identify and revitalize unsustainable hospitality units” and “regionally expand work force housing over the next several years.”</p><p>“We have taken meaningful steps to expand the stock of affordable housing in the region and will continue to seek opportunities to do so,” Mr. O’Donoghue wrote. “This is not only a commitment we have made to the community, it is also essential to the operations of the Estate.”</p><p>Opponents of the land-reform bill argue that it will only hurt large-scale farmers and others who tend the land, discouraging new investment in those communities. Sarah-Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land &amp; Estates, which represents rural landowners, said the government has an “overfocus” on concentrated land ownership that’s based on history and ideology. “In reality, it doesn’t matter who owns the land,” she said. “It’s about what they do with it.”</p><p>The landscapes beloved by Scots and tourists are “not unmanaged wilderness,” she added. “There are people whose investment and time and passion is going into maintaining those landscapes or improving them.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Colin Morton, a retired Kenmore resident and a member of the community council, touted Discovery’s renovations in the village. Opposition to the development has “nothing to do with what’s best for the area here or the community here,” he said. “It’s all about political point scoring.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Colin Morton, also a Kenmore resident and council member, said Taymouth Castle has benefited the local tourist economy.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Supporters of land reform, on the other hand, argue that making land more affordable and attainable is crucial for unwinding the power imbalance separating large-scale landowners from the communities that sit on their holdings. One way is with community right-to-buy policies, which theoretically make it easier for locals to collectively purchase the land where they live. Similar measures have been part of two land-reform bills passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2003 and 2016. Yet today, less than 3 percent of rural land is community-owned, according to Mr. Wightman’s analysis.</p><p>That leaves him skeptical about anything this new bill might accomplish — its proposals apply only to land that’s been put on the market, and then are too conservative. “The bottom line is they’ve introduced a bill that’s going to make no meaningful impact on the pattern of land ownership,” he said.</p><p>Whatever happens with the bill, said Mr. Ruskell, “we’ll need another land reform bill probably in 10 years time to take the next step. It’s probably going to take a generation to really start to unpick things.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The State of Real Estate</h2><h3>Whether you’re renting, buying or selling, here’s a look at real estate trends.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Hunt:</strong> After years of subletting in Manhattan, a young actor decided to put her savings to work and find a &#34;soft place to land.&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/20/realestate/hells-kitchen-upper-west-side-apartment-sale.html">Here’s what she found</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Living in New Bedford, Mass.</strong>: The Whaling City, home to a diverse food scene, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/realestate/new-bedford-ma-guide.html">will soon have a new rail connection to Boston</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loft Renovation</strong>: A Pennsylvania couple loved that their apartment was used in the movie “Philadelphia.” But a decade after moving in, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/realestate/philadelphia-movie-apartment-renovation.html">they needed to add a new scene</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Newburgh’s Philip Johnson House</strong>: Wolfhouse, as it is known, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/realestate/philip-johnson-house-newburgh-sale.html">was built in the New York town in the late 1940s</a> and was recently restored.
