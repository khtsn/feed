    <h1>Trump Says Nippon Steel Will Make Major Investment in U.S. Steel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“The concept, psychologically, was not good,” Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference on Friday, said of Nippon Steel’s plan to buy U.S. Steel.</p><p>U.S. Steel is based in Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-pennsylvania.html" title="">a key electoral battleground state</a>, and the powerful United Steelworkers union adamantly opposed the deal. The union reiterated those concerns on Friday.</p><p>“Our union has had no contact with either company or the administration regarding reports of a Nippon investment in U.S. Steel,” said David McCall, president of United Steelworkers International. “However, our concerns regarding Nippon’s continued interest in U.S. Steel remain unchanged.”</p><p>He added: “While we await the details of the proposed investment, we encourage President Trump to continue safeguarding the long-term future of the domestic steel industry by instead seeking American alternatives.”</p><p>Mr. Trump said on Friday that he remained opposed to Nippon’s owning the company but that an investment was “very exciting.” He spoke during a news conference with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan at the White House, where the two leaders discussed trade, tariffs and investment in the United States.</p></div></div>
