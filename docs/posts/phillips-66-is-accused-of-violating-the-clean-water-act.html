The company faces up to five years of probation on each count and a maximum of $2.4 million in fines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A spokesman for the company, Thaddeus Herrick, said Phillips 66 “will continue its cooperation with the U.S. attorney’s office and is prepared to present its case in these matters in court.”</p><p>“The company remains committed to operating safely and protecting the health and safety of our employees and the communities where we operate,” he said.</p><p>The Justice Department accused Phillips 66 of discharging contaminated wastewater on two occasions.</p><p>For over two and half hours on Nov. 24, 2020, the indictment said, the Carson oil refinery released 310,000 gallons of wastewater containing about 64,000 pounds of oil and grease. The oil-and-grease concentration of the water was about 300 times the amount allowed under the company’s permit.</p><p>On Feb. 8, 2021, the facility discharged 480,000 gallons of wastewater containing about 33,700 pounds of oil and grease over five and a half hours, the indictment said.</p><p>Mr. Estrada said on a call with reporters that investigators believed that the Los Angeles County wastewater treatment plant was able to capture all of the contaminated water before it was released, like most treated water, into the Pacific Ocean.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, “that’s not how it’s supposed to work,” he said.</p><p>He said the violation had come to light because staff at the water treatment facility smelled oil.</p><p>Last month, Phillips 66 said it would close the 101-year-old Carson oil refinery, as well as a 105-year-old facility in nearby Wilmington, Calif., in the fourth quarter of 2025, citing “market dynamics.”</p><p>Hiroko Tabuchi<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cade-metz">More about Cade Metz</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
