refurbished, four current and former U.S. officials said in recent days, and Western allies are discussing the logistics of Germany or Greece giving another one.</p><p>The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, declined to describe President Trump’s view of the decision to transfer more Patriot systems to Ukraine.</p><p>The White House’s National Security Council does not provide details on the strength and placement of defense systems, said James Hewitt, a spokesman for the council. “President Trump has been clear: he wants the war in Ukraine to end and the killing to stop,” he said.</p><p>A former White House official said that the Biden administration had secured the agreement with Israel in September, before the election won by Mr. Trump. The Defense Department said in a statement that “it continues to provide equipment to Ukraine from previously authorized” packages, referring to weaponry pulled from existing inventories and new purchases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The delivery, which has not been previously reported, comes as Russia has stepped up its attacks on Ukraine, including an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/kyiv-russia-missile-strike.html" title="">April 24 missile strike</a> on Kyiv that was the deadliest since last summer.</p><p>A year ago, allies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/04/us/politics/ukraine-nato-patriot-air-defense.html" title="">struggled</a> to answer a demand by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for seven Patriot systems. Although Ukraine now has eight, only six are functioning. The other two are being refurbished, one of the U.S. officials said. With the one from Israel, and one from Germany or Greece, Ukraine would have 10 Patriot systems in total, largely to protect the capital, Kyiv.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rescue worker and another man at a two-story apartment building in Kyiv that was destroyed by a Russian ballistic missile, last Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As Russia has intensified recent attacks, Mr. Trump’s recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky.html" title="">public remarks</a> on the war have softened in favor of Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Trump had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky-putin.html" title="">cordial meeting</a> with Mr. Zelensky at Pope Francis’ funeral in Rome last weekend, after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">disastrous one</a> in February in the Oval Office. He has dialed down his negative rhetoric about Mr. Zelensky and questioned whether Russia is serious about peace talks. A delayed minerals deal with Ukraine was signed on Wednesday, paving the way for more U.S. military aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Saturday, Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/rus/news/2025/05/3/7210821/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told reporters</a> in Kyiv that the minerals deal could mean the United States would send more air-defense systems.</p><p>Under U.S. export rules for sensitive defense equipment, the United States must approve any transfers of the American-made Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, even if they were coming via other countries. The systems are scarce, and their deployment is often a shell game of world hot spots, figuring out which global crisis requires them most to defend U.S. troops, bases and allies.</p><p>Mr. Trump has made ending the war a signature goal of U.S. foreign policy, but at the same time, has flipped that policy on its head. Even though Russia started the war, Mr. Trump has frequently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/politics/trump-putin-russia.html" title="">expressed admiration</a> for its president, Vladimir V. Putin, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html" title="">adopted</a> some Russian talking points, like saying that Ukraine should not be able to join NATO and that Ukraine was somehow responsible for the war despite being invaded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump during his meeting in the Oval Office with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Since the start of the war, Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly asked for <a href="https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/04/08/ukraine-receives-only-half-of-requested-patriot-air-defense-systems-capable-of-intercepting-ballistic-targets-as-missile-shortage-intensifies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more Patriot systems</a>, saying they were essential to defend his country.

By <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/world/europe/ukraine-patriots-us.html" title="">January 2024</a>, there were already missile shortages.</p><p>On Friday, Col. Yurii Ihnat, a spokesman in Ukraine’s air force, said it was no secret that Ukraine needed more air defenses. “We are really waiting” for supplies, he said.</p><p>Since taking office, Mr. Trump has publicly brushed off Mr. Zelensky’s requests for more Patriots, which Mr. Zelensky has recently offered to <a href="https://thedefensepost.com/2025/04/18/ukraine-patriot-systems-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">buy</a>.
