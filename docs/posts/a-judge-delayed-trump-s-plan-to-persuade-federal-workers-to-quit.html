The offer, which had a deadline of midnight tonight, was part of a sweeping effort by President Trump and Elon Musk to drastically cut the size of the federal work force.</p><p>Judge George O’Toole Jr., a Clinton appointee, paused the deadline until at least Monday, when the court would consider a legal challenge. It is not clear how the delay will affect the more than 40,000 federal employees who had already signed up to resign through the program.</p><p>The Trump administration has been pressuring workers for the last week to accept the offer, while the biggest government unions have been urging them to decline.</p><p>The judge’s decision appeared unlikely to end the broader effort by Trump and Musk to sharply reduce the size and cost of the federal government. The administration is planning to reduce the number of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/06/us/president-trump-news/usaid-job-cuts?smid=url-share" title="">workers at the U.S. foreign aid agency from more than 10,000 to about 290 positions</a>.
