    <h1>What to Know About Today’s Meth</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Fentanyl overdoses have finally begun to decline over the past year, but that good news has obscured a troubling shift in illicit drug use: a nationwide surge in methamphetamine, a powerful, highly addictive stimulant.</p><p>This isn’t the ’90s club drug or even the blue-white tinged crystals cooked up in “Breaking Bad.” As cartels keep revising lab formulas to make their product more addictive and potent, often using <a href="https://www.env.nm.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/10/List_of_Hazardous_Chemicals_in_CDLs.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hazardous</a> chemicals<a href="https://treatmentmagazine.com/what-is-p2p-meth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">,</a> many experts on addiction think that today’s meth is more dangerous than older versions. Here is what to know.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-4a267091">What is meth?</h2><p>Meth, short for methamphetamine, is a stimulant, a category of drugs that includes cocaine. Meth is far stronger than coke, with effects that last many hours longer. It comes in pill, powder or paste form and is smoked, snorted, swallowed or injected.</p><p>Meth jolts the central nervous system and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5050330/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prompts the brain</a> to release exorbitant amounts of reinforcing, feel-good neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which help people experience euphoria and drive them to keep seeking it.</p><p>Meth is an amphetamine, a category of stimulant drugs perhaps best known to the public as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/well/mind/adhd-adderall-ritalin-stimulant-facts.html" title="">A.D.H.D. prescription</a> medications Adderall and Vyvanse. Those stimulants are milder and shorter-lasting than meth but, if misused, they too can be addictive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2cb93408">What are meth’s negative side effects?</h2><p>They vary, depending on the tolerance of the person taking it and the means of ingestion.</p><p>After the drug’s rush has abated, many users keep bingeing it. They forget to drink water and are usually unable to sleep or eat for days. In this phase, known as “tweaking,” users can become hyper-focused on activities such as taking apart bicycles — which they forget to reassemble — or spending hours collecting things like pebbles and shiny gum wrappers. They may become agitated and aggressive. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535356/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paranoia, hallucinations</a> and psychosis can set in.</p><p>Some people incessantly scratch or pick their skin to root out “meth bugs,” often leaving scars or open wounds.</p><p>Long-term side effects include cognitive decline, memory loss, severe depression, heart-valve damage, and gum disease and tooth decay, known as <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/population-health/odh/documents/meth-mouth.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“meth mouth.”</a></p><hr/><h2 id="link-2acefa97">Can meth kill?</h2><p>Unless the meth dose is adulterated with fentanyl — which is increasingly common — it is usually not immediately lethal. But people can overdose on meth alone, and those deaths are rising.</p><p>In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, nearly 35,000 overdose deaths in the United States involved meth or other stimulants, with or without fentanyl contributing. That amounted to a rise of about 870 percent from about 3,600 such deaths in 2013, according to researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The true measure of meth’s lethality cannot be captured by overdoses. People die from meth-related causes, including strokes and brain bleeds, as well as accidents while on a meth binge, such as wandering in traffic and being hit by a vehicle. Meth can cause chronic users to overheat and go into convulsions.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-69f22d12">How does meth get into the country?</h2><p>Traffickers hide it in numerous ways. Law enforcement officers have seized shipments of meth in bottles of <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-officers-seize-over-20-million-methamphetamine-roma-port-entry" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mineral water</a> (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/members-massive-methamphetamine-conversion-and-trafficking-ring-sentenced" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“conversion labs”</a> in the United States then extract the drug from <a href="https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/kcso-two-arrested-in-bakersfield-after-meth-lab-bust-nets-85-pounds-of-drugs-kern-county-sheriffs-office-california" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the liquid</a>); in a tractor-trailer that listed its cargo as <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-officers-intercept-over-212-million-methamphetamine-pharr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“tomatillos</a>”; stuffed in rolls of <a href="https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/two-men-sentenced-over-failed-plot-import-600kg-methamphetamine-hidden" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">toilet paper;</a> disguised as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5090995/watermelon-meth-5-million-san-diego-border-checkpoint" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">watermelons</a>; and mailed inside bags of <a href="https://www.wsaz.com/2025/03/06/nearly-40-lbs-meth-found-inside-cheetos-bags-authorities-say/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cheetos</a>.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-78e740ae">How can people quit meth?</h2><p>Although there are medications that suppress cravings for opioids, there are no approved medicines to treat meth addiction. Moreover, overdose reversal medications like naloxone do not work on a person overdosing on meth (unless the drug was adulterated with fentanyl).</p><p>One <a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/DMC-ODS-Contingency-Management.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">behavioral treatment</a> for meth addiction is called “contingency management.” It rewards clients with modest gift cards when their urine screens are negative and has <a href="https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/White-Paper-Contingenc-Management-with-Homeless-Veterans-508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long been featured in addiction treatment at Veterans Affairs</a> programs.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-27f4e6d4">Are there other names for meth?</h2><p>It’s known as <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Methamphetamine-2020.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ice,</a> Tina, crystal, glass and speed. The nickname <a href="https://time.com/archive/6702372/southern-california-tales-of-the-crank/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“crank</a>” was a nod to bikers who smuggled it in the crankcase of their engines.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-2888b13b">How long has meth been around?</h2><p>It has been around over 100 years, but has changed considerably and become much more potent.</p><p>In 1887, a German chemist synthesized the chemical compound ephedrine, found in <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ephedra" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the ephedra plant.</a> By 1893, Japanese scientists were developing methamphetamine. During World War II, German, British and American military distributed meth tablets to keep troops awake and to suppress appetites. In Japan, the tablets were given to kamikaze pilots and also <a href="https://www.aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-05/rpp081.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold over the counter</a>.</p><p>In 1944, the Food and Drug Administration approved a <a href="https://www.lookchem.com/cas-763/7632-10-2.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">methamphetamine medication,</a> Desoxyn, now infrequently prescribed to treat narcolepsy, obesity and A.D.H.D.</p><p>According to <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Methamphetamine.html?id=Ng_XDQAAQBAJ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a>, by the late 1960s, the warning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF8HPLmrmMc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Speed Kills”</a>— referring to drugs as well as driving — was being promoted in the United States.</p><p>In the 1990s, meth became known as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/12/nyregion/beast-bathhouse-crystal-meth-use-gay-men-threatens-reignite-epidemic.html" title="">dance club</a> drug. Home “cooks” made batches of it, often using pseudoephedrine, an ingredient in over-the-counter cold medications. </p><p>In 2005, alarmed at the rising use of meth, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/meth/combat-methamphetamine-epidemic-act.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act</a>, requiring retailers to move cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine behind the counter. Meth production began to drop, while the opioid crisis gathered force. </p><p>Then, as reported in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/the-new-meth/620174/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>, chemists discovered a powerful formulation that sidestepped pseudoephedrine. This formula was adapted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/fentanyl-methamphetamine-mexico-border" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexican</a> cartels, who began mass-producing meth in labs and distributing it along the West Coast and throughout the Southwest.<span>  </span></p><p>In its 2024 annual <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/508_5.23.2024%20NDTA-updated.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report on national drug threats</a>, the Drug Enforcement Administration said that cartels had been exploiting the American demand for counterfeit pills by producing meth in tablets that mimic A.D.H.D. medications.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jan Hoffman is a health reporter for The Times covering drug addiction and health law.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
