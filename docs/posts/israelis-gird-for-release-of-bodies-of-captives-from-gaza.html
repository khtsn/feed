As part of the deal’s first phase, Hamas committed to returning 25 Israelis held hostage in Gaza and the remains of eight others in exchange for 1,500 Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel.</p><p>For the past few weeks, Israelis have watched tearful parents and siblings embrace their freed loved ones, many of whom had scarcely been heard from since they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-we-know-hostage-release.html" title="">kidnapped</a> by Hamas and its allies during the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel.</p><p>Palestinians have greeted released prisoners, some of whom spent decades in Israeli jails for militant attacks. Many others, including women and minors, were detained indefinitely without charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The scenes anticipated on Thursday in Israel are likely to be much more somber.</p><p>The bodies of the Israeli hostages will be ferried by the International Committee of the Red Cross to Israeli forces. They will then be brought back to Israel for forensic testing to verify their identity and, if possible, establish the cause of death, which could take time.</p><p>Hamas has yet to formally announce the names of all the captives whose bodies will be returned. But Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas leader, said on Tuesday that they would include members of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/middleeast/bibas-bodies-death-hamas-israel-exchange.html" title="">the Bibas family</a>, whose abduction shocked and horrified Israelis and others around the world.</p><p>Shiri Bibas, 32, was kidnapped alongside her two redheaded children, one of whom was not yet nine months old. In November 2023, Hamas said all three had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli officials have expressed concern for their fate but have not confirmed their deaths.</p><p>Ms. Bibas’s husband, Yarden, was abducted separately and taken, wounded, to the Gaza Strip. He was finally freed as part of the cease-fire in early February in a highly choreographed Hamas release ceremony.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the four bodies, Israel will release Gazan women and minors in Israeli detention facilities, except for those accused of participating in the Oct. 7 attacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hamas is expected to release six living Israeli hostages on Saturday. The following week, it will send back the remains of four more Israeli hostages, which will round out the list that the two sides agreed upon under the terms of the cease-fire deal. They will be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>Assuming the releases go forward as planned, dozens of living hostages and more than 30 others presumed dead by Israel will remain in Gaza by early March. Hamas abducted more than 250 people — mostly civilians — during the Oct. 2023 attack.</p><p>Israel and Hamas agreed that the initial phase of the deal would last six weeks, during which they would negotiate the next step. The first phase is set to end on March 2, but talks to extend the agreement into a second phase have yet to begin, according to the Qatari government, which has been brokering the truce alongside Egypt and the United States.</p><p>Analysts say it is far from clear that both sides will reach an agreement on the second phase, which is supposed to end the war, free the remaining living hostages and ensure a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.</p><p>Israeli leaders have said they will not countenance anything short of the end of Hamas’s rule and the demilitarization of Gaza. Hamas has shown little appetite to take apart its military wing or send its Gaza leaders into exile.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
