After losing map one, the Americas LCQ winners fought hard against the second seed from EMEA to tie the series and dominated on map three to move further up the upper bracket.</p>

<p>The series began on Haven, with GX and MIBR both running double-Controller with Viper and Omen. GX won the pistol, but <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/31574/srn">
		srN	</a>
</span> and MIBR took advantage of some mistakes from GX to win an eco. Even after that rough round, GX was able to recover and retake the lead. That eco did mess up the economy enough so that MIBR was within reach, but GX entered the half up 7-5.</p>

<p>MIBR won the pistol to tie the game at 7-7, and again at 8-8, but GX GC ended the half strong to win Haven 13-8 and take the series lead. </p>

<p>Abyss started with both teams running slightly different compositions, as MIBR GC opted for a double-Initiator with a Cypher, while GX GC ran double-Controller with Astra and Omen. The start could not have been better for MIBR, as the team won the pistol and converted the bonus round to stretch the lead to 9-1. GX ended the half with two round wins, so MIBR were up 9-3 at halftime.</p>

<p>That lead stretched to 10-3 after another MIBR pistol win, but the tables turned as GX were now the team to win a big eco round. GX chipped away at the lead, with <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/17343/ness">

</span> playing amazingly on Omen to put all the pressure on round 24, down 12-11. That was when <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/19791/mel">

</span> got one kill from their Sova ult and another on a Jett with their ultimate up, putting MIBR up 5v3 and leading to a 13-11 map win.</p>


<p><em>melissa gets two early kills on the final round of Abyss against GX GC.</em></p>

<p>Split would be the decider, with the teams running two different compositions. Both teams ran double-Duelist, but the only overlap was Raze and Viper. GX ran Skye, Waylay, and Astra, while MIBR ran Yoru, Fade, and Omen. MIBR won the first pistol, and despite a bonus round loss, ran ahead to a 7-1 lead. The Duelist duels were leaning toward srN and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/4807/bstrdd">
		bstrdd	</a>
</span>, who were frying GX en route to a 9-3 lead. </p>

<p>When the sides swapped and GX had its opportunity to show off its double-Duelist attack side, it was quickly stifled by a pistol win and bonus round conversion from MIBR. Up 12-3, it was just a matter of time, and MIBR GC eventually won Split 13-5 and the series 2-1.</p>

<p>The standout player across both teams was bstrdd from MIBR GC, who played both Sentinel and Duelist throughout the series, finishing with amazing stats in the comeback win. They ended the series with a 1.32 match rating and 79% KAST, with their Yoru performance on map three sealing the victory.</p>

<p>With the win, MIBR GC will face <span data-ref-id="6">
