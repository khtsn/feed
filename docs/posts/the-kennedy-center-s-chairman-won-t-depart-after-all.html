The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts had announced that its longtime board chairman, David M. Rubenstein, would step down in January and had <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/news-room/press-release-landing-page/david-rubenstein-to-retire-as-kennedy-center-chairman/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appointed a search committee</a> to find a successor.</p><p>But last month, shortly after the presidential election, the Kennedy Center announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/david-m-rubenstein?page=2" title="">Mr. Rubenstein</a>, a private equity titan who has led its board of 14 years, would <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/news-room/press-release-landing-page/david-rubenstein/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stay on in the position until September 2026</a>.</p><p>The decision ensures continuity at a moment when the Kennedy Center, like much of Washington, is preparing for a second Trump administration. (On Sunday, President Biden is expected to attend the Kennedy Center Honors as it celebrates Francis Ford Coppola, the Grateful Dead,<strong> </strong>Bonnie Raitt and Arturo Sandoval; President-elect Donald J. Trump did not attend the ceremonies during his first term.) But it also raises questions about why the center failed to find a new chair.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/arts/music/deborah-rutter-kennedy-center.html" title="">Deborah F. Rutter</a>, the center’s president, said that on Nov. 15 the board’s search committee decided to keep Mr. Rubenstein on in part because the center is in the quiet phase of an endowment campaign, making a leadership transition “really tough.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We looked at the needs of the Kennedy Center in a variety of different ways moving forward,” she said in an interview. “It is important for us to have somebody who knows the center and who knows and can play the leadership role that we need.”</p><p>Mr. Rubenstein, a co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, has given the center $111 million over the years. He was initially appointed by former President George W. Bush. </p><p>Several people close to the search selection process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe it, said that a number of people had been discussed as possible new chairs.</p><p>One was Anthony Welters, the Kennedy Center’s vice chairman, who also serves on the board of the Carlyle Group. Mr. Welters, who made his fortune in the health care industry, has drawn scrutiny in recent years for helping Justice Clarence Thomas buy a recreational vehicle by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/05/us/clarence-thomas-rv-anthony-welters.html" title="">underwriting, at least in part, its $267,230 purchase</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>There were also discussions with Laurene Powell Jobs<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-laurene-powell-jobs.html" title="">,</a> a philanthropist and investor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-laurene-powell-jobs.html" title="">who is close to Vice President Kamala Harris</a> and is not on the Kennedy Center board, several people familiar with the conversations said, though it was not clear exactly what was discussed. Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Powell Jobs declined to comment.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Rubenstein, who has been chairman for  14 years, has donated $111 million to the center, making him its biggest individual donor.  </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Rutter said that no formal offers or plans for a new chair materialized during the search process, adding that “only the search committee would know what has happened.”</p><p>“Everybody wants to know who’s replacing David Rubenstein because he’s everywhere and he’s the most generous person alive today,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Rutter said that “there have been lots of people who have come up to me and said Tony Welters should be our next board chair.” She called Ms. Powell Jobs an “extraordinary person” and acknowledged that they had spoken but declined to say what was discussed.</p><p>“It would be fantastic to be able to work with her if she could be a member of our board someday,” Ms. Rutter said. “She’s a real visionary.”</p><p>Mr. Rubenstein did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The center is the home of the National Symphony Orchestra, Washington National Opera, and visiting theater, dance and musical artists. Its trustees are appointed by the President and serve six-year terms. Currently, 29 of them were appointed by Mr. Trump; 7 by Mr. Biden. Eleven of Mr. Trump’s appointees will soon rotate off the board and Mr. Biden is expected to replace them before he leaves office, which will leave the board evenly divided between Trump and Biden appointees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s really amazing and exists, as far as I know, in this country alone, to have a nationally based trustees who are completely bipartisan,” Ms. Rutter said. “They know and speak really eloquently about the importance of the bipartisan work that we’re doing.”</p><p>Ms. Rutter said that she has regular contact with trustees and has recently spoken with two, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/mike-huckabee-ambassador-to-israel.html" title="">Mike Huckabee</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/us/politics/pam-bondi-attorney-general-trump.html" title="">Pam Bondi</a>, who were picked by Mr. Trump to serve in his new administration. Ms. Bondi is active on the Kennedy Center’s audit committee and education committee, Ms. Rutter said, adding that Mr. Huckabee had suggested possible candidates to be honored.</p><p>During his first term Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/arts/nea-neh-endowments-trump.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">proposed eliminating</a> both the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, but they survived, and even grew, because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/arts/trump-arts-nea-funding.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">bipartisan backing in Congress</a>.</p><p>Ms. Rutter said that the federal funds that the Kennedy Center receives — for building operations, maintenance and repairs — remained steady during the first Trump administration and that going forward she is “not worried about the federal funding for the memorial to John F. Kennedy.”</p><p>“In this country, it’s not that Democrats or Republicans are the only ones who are keeping the arts alive,” she added. “The arts are for everyone.”</p><p>Theodore Schleifer<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Robin Pogrebin, who has been a reporter for The Times for nearly 30 years, covers arts and culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robin-pogrebin">More about Robin Pogrebin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
