She was 85.</p><p>Her death was announced by Garth Greenan Gallery in New York, which represented her. The gallery said she had pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Ms. Smith’s abiding artistic medium was collage, in the broadest sense of the word. With a wide range of works — including mixed-media canvases and conceptually tinted assemblages, as well as drawings and paintings that Joshua Hunt recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/t-magazine/jaune-quick-to-see-smith.html" title="">described in The New York Times as</a> “Kandinsky turned loose in the American plains” — she seamlessly married a host of personal and political references with influences from European, American and Native art history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/30Smith-8-jvzc-print2/30Smith-8-jvzc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/30Smith-8-jvzc-print2/30Smith-8-jvzc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/30Smith-8-jvzc-print2/30Smith-8-jvzc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A close-up of an abstract artwork in shades of orange, green, blue and red." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/30Smith-8-jvzc-print2/30Smith-8-jvzc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/30Smith-8-jvzc-print2/30Smith-8-jvzc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/30Smith-8-jvzc-print2/30Smith-8-jvzc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 727w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/03/multimedia/30Smith-8-jvzc-print2/30Smith-8-jvzc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1454w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/df1631a3-4863-57f3-a7ae-1d745d937b16" decoding="async" width="600" height="845"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Kalispell #1” (1979).

Cohen noted that Ms. Smith drew on the narrative pictography and decorative abstraction of the Plains even while taking cues from artists like Paul Klee, Joan Miró and Robert Rauschenberg.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>What held all these sources together was a consistent color palette of red and brown; a distinctively back-and-forth sense of composition in which a striking central image was often balanced by an undertow of peripheral figures; and Ms. Smith’s unerring instinct for narrative.</p><p>“Part of what I do in my work is using my work as a platform for my beliefs,” she said in an <a href="https://americanart.si.edu/artist/jaune-quick-see-smith-4505" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with the Smithsonian American Art Museum. “Can I tell a story? Can I make it a good story? Can I add some humor to it? Can I get your attention? Those are all things that I try to do with my artwork.”</p><p>That’s not to say that the combinations were always in harmony. On the contrary, Ms. Smith’s work was typically characterized by a special sort of tension, one that evoked a lingering sense of trauma, violence or loss. “Gifts for Trading Land With White People” (1992) is a 14-foot-long painting on which a simple canoe is drawn over collaged-in newspaper photographs of Native Americans; over it, Ms. Smith hung a clothesline’s worth of sports gear, chewing-tobacco packets and other items picturing Native American stereotypes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Smith’s “Gifts for Trading Land With White People” (1992) is a 14-foot-long painting with a clothesline’s worth of sports gear, chewing-tobacco packets and other items hanging over it.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The forthright, factual quality of the photographs is strikingly at odds with the grinning caricature on a Cleveland Indians baseball cap, while the painting, as a more or less conventional flat surface, exhibits a similar kind of clash with the line of objects dangling over it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A detail of “Gifts for Trading Land With White People.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In other words, whether you consider its content or its form, it’s an artwork that refuses to settle down.</p><p>Ms. Smith’s career as a curator began in the 1970s, when, as a student at the University of New Mexico, she formed the Grey Canyon Artists collective with five other Native students. They immediately organized a traveling exhibition. Her own career was taking off, too: Shortly afterward, she had her first New York City solo show at Kornblee Gallery and was reviewed in Art in America and The Village Voice.</p><p>But whether because she was so often the first Native American artist in the room, because it had taken so much struggle to get there, or simply because she understood it to be a basic value of her culture, Ms. Smith never stopped trying to share the access and attention she won with her peers.</p><p>She curated more than 30 shows of Indigenous art. <a href="https://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2023/ancestors-contemporary-art-native-americans.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Land Carries Our Ancestors: Contemporary Art by Native Americans,”</a> which opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 2023, involved nearly 50 participating artists. A current show at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University in New Jersey, <a href="https://zimmerli.rutgers.edu/art/exhibition/indigenous-identities-here-now-always" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Indigenous Identities: Here, Now &amp; Always,”</a> includes works in a variety of media made by 97 living artists from 74 Indigenous nations and communities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Smith in 2023 at the opening of “The Land Carries Our Ancestors: Contemporary Art by Native Americans” at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

I am one among many,” Ms. Smith told <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/jaune-quick-to-see-smith-artist-profile-memory-map.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vulture</a> in 2023. “My community comes with me.”</p><p>Jaune (pronounced “Zhawn”) Quick-to-See Smith was born on Jan. 15, 1940, in St. Ignatius Mission, on the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana. She was an enrolled Salish member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nation; she also had French Cree and Shoshone ancestry. The name Quick-to-See came from a great-grandmother of the same name.</p><p>Her mother, Hazel Wixon, disappeared from her life when Jaune was 2, and she was raised by her father, Arthur Albert Smith, a horse trader.</p><p>She is survived by her husband, Andy Ambrose, a retired human resources consultant in the tech industry; her sons, Bill Ambrose and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nealambrosesmith/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neal Ambrose-Smith</a>, an artist who often collaborated with her; her daughter, Roxanne Ambrose; and seven grandchildren.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Smith at work in her studio in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brad Trone for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/t-magazine/jaune-quick-to-see-smith.html" title="">The Times</a> in 2021, Ms. Smith described her childhood, much of it spent in Washington State, as “dystopian.” In addition to traveling with her father to sell horses, she worked alongside adults picking and processing fruit and vegetables.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But she found time to become a voracious reader while hiding to avoid chores, and she managed to save scraps of paper on which her father had drawn animals. When she was 13, she saw the 1953 movie “Moulin Rouge,” about the French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and decided to become an artist.</p><p>Pursuing higher education despite financial challenges, and despite being discouraged by instructors — they told her that women couldn’t be artists and that “Indians don’t go to college,” she said — she earned an associate degree from Olympic College in Bremerton, Wash., in 1960; a bachelor’s degree from Framingham State University, in Massachusetts, in 1976; and a master’s from the University of New Mexico in 1980.</p><p>The University of New Mexico would later award her an honorary doctorate, as would Minneapolis College of Art and Design, Massachusetts College of Art and Design and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.</p><p>Well into the 1980s, Ms. Smith was still making modestly scaled, largely abstract paintings and works on paper. It was only around the end of that decade that her work got bigger, messier, more explicit and more complicated.</p><p>“In the 1980s, I was talking to Andy Ambrose, my partner, and I told him, ‘I don’t think anybody’s listening to me. I’m not getting my messages across,’” she remembered in 2023. “And he said, ‘Well, think about an icon. Maybe you need an icon.’ And then I began thinking about what are the things that my tribe might see the most? And I thought about a woman’s cut-wing dress, a man’s war shirt, a man’s vest, the canoe, the buffalo, the horse and the coyote.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In “Indian Drawing Lesson (After Leonardo)” (1993), Ms. Smith depicted a stately buffalo with multiple legs that suggest motion, like the arms of Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jaune Quick-to-See Smith</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>She began drawing large-scale outlines of horses, canoes, men’s vests and buffalo, as in “Indian Drawing Lesson (After Leonardo),” from 1993, in which a stately buffalo’s legs multiply to suggest motion, like the arms of Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man.</p><p>Even as she simplified her motifs, though, Ms. Smith was greatly increasing the number of elements seen behind them. A pair of large canoes, which appeared in two 16-foot paintings — “Trade Canoe for Don Quixote” (2004) and “Trade Canoe: Don Quixote in Sumeria” (2005) — took on the Iraq war and American involvement in the Middle East with casts of bellicose passengers.</p><p>“If you look carefully,” Ms. Smith explained, “you can see that I used everything I could find about war. There are references to the work of José Guadalupe Posada, skulls, devils, maggots, skeletons, characters such as Mickey Mouse with a dollar sign, and Goya’s and Picasso’s images about war.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In her 2004 painting “Trade Canoe for Don Quixote,” Ms. Smith took on the Iraq war and American involvement in the Middle East.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>To make her goal — the representation of contemporary Native life — more transparent to viewers, she also began incorporating newspaper clippings. The technique was borrowed from Robert Rauschenberg, but its effect, in Ms. Smith’s hands, was different.</p><p>“If I do it,” she recalled in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/arts/design/jaune-quick-to-see-smith-whitney-art.html" title="">a 2023 Times profile</a>, “I can make it so that it really says something.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Ms. Smith’s work has been collected by many museums, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art.</p><p>A 2023 exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, <a href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/jaune-quick-to-see-smith" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Memory Map,”</a> was the culmination of five solo shows there. It was also the museum’s first retrospective of a Native American artist.</p><p>“I think I’m a miracle, and I say that whenever I talk to an audience,” Ms. Smith said in 2021. “I tell them, ‘I’m a miracle, and any Native person is a miracle.’”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Will Heinrich writes about new developments in contemporary art, and has previously been a critic for The New Yorker and The New York Observer.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/will-heinrich">More about Will Heinrich</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>6</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, 85, Artist With Indigenous Focus, Dies<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
