They are second-guessing how the party’s leaders — like Mr. Schumer, who brandishes his flip phone as a point of pride — are communicating their message in the TikTok era, as Republicans dominate the digital town square.</p><p>And they are demanding that the party develop a bolder policy agenda that can answer the desperation of tens of millions of people who are struggling financially at a time when belief in the American dream is dimming.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In other words, the younger generation is done with deference.</p><p>Some who argue for more militancy in opposing Mr. Trump say the party’s elders tend to be less comfortable with the type of unbending political warfare that is called for.</p><p>“Our party needs more of a fighting spirit,” said Representative Chris Deluzio, a 40-year-old from outside Pittsburgh. “This is not a normal administration, and they’re willing to do dangerous things.”</p><p>The split is “not solely along generational lines,” he said. “But I do think the newer, younger members maybe get this intuitively.”</p><p>Mr. Deluzio said that Democrats elected before the Trump era tended to be shaped by fond recollections of comity and camaraderie across the aisle. “Those of us who are a little younger or have come to the Congress more recently, we don’t have the experience of some days of yore where things were more functional and the parties all got along,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who burst onto the political scene by slaying a giant of the party in a 2018 primary challenge, pointedly declined to shoot down a question about a future primary against Mr. Schumer, who is not on the ballot again until 2028. Interviewed on CNN on Thursday, she called his turnabout on the legislation — which every Democrat in the House save one opposed — a “tremendous mistake” and urged him to reverse himself.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Chris Deluzio, a 40-year-old from outside Pittsburgh, said, “Our party needs more of a fighting spirit.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Each younger lawmaker’s prescriptions for the party may be different. But many of them speak of an imperative both to fight and to act. Representative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, 37, said Democrats needed an ambitious strategy to address educational deficits caused by the coronavirus pandemic, promote housing construction and take on social media corporations that are fraying the social fabric.</p><p>“I’m interested in ideas. Do we have big ideas for how we’re going to govern better than Trump?” he said. “Younger lawmakers have that sense of urgency and ferocity.”</p><p>That urgency is also driving younger Democrats to try to usher their elders out of the way. Some older House Democrats have already been pushed out of key congressional posts. Younger primary challengers are laying the groundwork to try to oust more senior lawmakers from office entirely, with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 84, among those targeted.</p><p>And in private, 30- and 40-something lawmakers commiserate about having to decipher the mysteries of the internet for their older colleagues; one said she recently had to explain to another House member what a podcast was.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The generation that got us to this point does not have the skills or stomach to get us to the next point,” said Amanda Litman, who leads Run for Something, a progressive group that recruits younger and more diverse Democrats to seek local office.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amanda Litman, who leads Run for Something, a progressive group that recruits younger and more diverse Democrats to seek local office, said she had heard from at least half a dozen young people who were plotting congressional primary challenges in 2026.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Litman said she had already heard from at least half a dozen young people — more than ever, she said — who are plotting congressional primary challenges in 2026.</p><p>“I would not be surprised to see, if not quite a Tea Party equivalent, a wave of challengers against old Democratic incumbents in particular,” Ms. Litman said. “It is not going to be ideological.

We absolutely do,” Mr. Hogg said. “But for God’s sake, we really need some younger leaders, too.”</p><p>A survivor of the 2018 Parkland, Fla., school shooting who built a national profile speaking out against gun violence, Mr. Hogg said the Democrats were especially wanting for leaders capable of exploiting the media landscape as “the asset that it is” rather than “managing it as the liability it has become for many people in our party.”</p><p>“We only have one Gen Z member of Congress that has been elected in the last two elections,” he said, alluding to Maxwell Frost, 28, the Florida Democrat. “That’s insane.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Indeed, younger Democrats tend to communicate with voters in ways that are more authentically online.</p><p>Representative Sara Jacobs of California, 36 — who said she recently had to explain what a podcast was to a Democratic colleague she would not name — has started <a href="https://www.instagram.com/repsarajacobs/reel/DGy1W3Zu8p5/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posting</a> “get ready with me” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFof3u4tvtS/?igsh=MWpqa3hzMHNnaW9qMA%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videos</a> on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/repsarajacobs/reel/DGWCSPfuug0/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a> discussing complex policy issues while applying makeup.</p><p>“Democrats won the people who watch cable news and read newspapers,” Ms. Jacobs said. “We lost the people who don’t feel like they’re part of politics at all. And so, how do we go to them, instead of keep trying to force them to come to us?”</p><h2 id="link-4c19518d">‘Old versus the young’</h2><p>The frustrations of younger House Democrats boiled over even before Mr. Trump took office, when three of them successfully challenged older, more senior colleagues for the posts of ranking member on the powerful Judiciary, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees.</p><p>Of course, youth is relative in Congress: The top Democrat on Judiciary is now 62, instead of 77.
