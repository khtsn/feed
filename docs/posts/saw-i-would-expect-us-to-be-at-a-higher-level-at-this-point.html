The officers and transit officials had singled the woman out after receiving cues from an undercover plant who was observing riders on the bus.</p><p>The woman appeared stunned and burst into tears. She was still crying when she boarded the next M96 bus that pulled up.</p><p>While most enforcement efforts have focused on the subway, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/nyregion/nyc-bus-subway-fare-evasion.html" title="">fare evasion is much more prevalent</a> on city buses, and transit leaders this week expanded efforts on buses, where one out of two passengers fails to pay. According to the latest statistics from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency lost $285 million in 2022 to fare evasion in the subway system and $315 million on buses even as roughly twice the number of passengers were riding the trains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police officers and transit workers stationed at the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 97th Street were part of a team whose job it is to stop fare beaters. Teams like these will be deployed throughout the bus system in the coming days.</p><p>But it is a tall task for transit leaders, because the disregard for fares is deeply ingrained in bus riders.</p><p>Enforcement is especially difficult on buses, where there are no turnstiles or gates to block access. And some riders also feel justified in not paying the $2.90 fare because heavy traffic and a lack of bus lanes means that bus service can be slow and unreliable. Officials have also said that a period when the authority made bus rides free for a few months during the pandemic in 2020 reinforced the sense that paying the fare was optional.</p><p>On buses, <a href="https://metrics.mta.info/?bus/fareevasion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fare evasion rate</a> was 39 percent at the beginning of 2023 and 48 percent at the start of this year.</p><p>During Thursday’s crackdown, riders appeared bewildered. A woman tried to shove her way onto the bus, past the officers huddled around the bus doors handing out fliers with details about the added enforcement. Many commuters rushed off the bus and grabbed the fliers without giving them a glance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Several people said they were happy to see the rules being enforced.</p><p>Michelle Rosario, 50, who lives in New Jersey and rides a train and a bus to get to work at a hospital in Manhattan, said she was tired of seeing riders sneak onto buses without paying and harassing bus drivers when they tried to enforce the fare.</p><p>“People should pay their fare just like everybody else,” Ms. Rosario said.</p><p>The ramped up enforcement aims to aid an agency facing a dire financial future, in part because of widespread fare evasion. The authority has predicted <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/147291" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deficits of almost $1 billion</a> by 2028, largely because of lower-than-expected fare revenue.</p><p>For years, the agency has sent groups of unarmed, uniformed employees to patrol buses and give tickets to riders who do not pay as part of its Evasion and Graffiti Lawlessness Eradication program, known as EAGLE. Last year, it <a href="https://new.mta.info/press-release/mta-eagle-teams-begin-bus-stop-hub-approach-part-of-enhanced-fare-enforcement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded the routes</a> the groups covered.</p><p>At the same time, the Police Department created a unit specifically dedicated to bus fare evasion. As part of that effort, the department deploys officers alongside the transit agency’s teams to more effectively curb fare beating and to keep the transit workers safe from retaliation.</p><p>It’s unclear how successful the latest round of enforcement will be. Past attempts to rein the problem in have failed to yield results on the subway, where <a href="https://metrics.mta.info/?subway/fareevasion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14 percent of riders failed to pay</a> to ride during the first three months of the year. During the same time period last year, the rate was 11 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ticketing efforts also risk slowing down buses. Riders on Thursday accused the police officers and transit workers of interrupting their commute.</p><p>“Y’all holding up the bus,” one man shouted, adding an expletive. “We’re trying to get to work.”</p><p>Another woman who declined to identify herself was escorted off the bus and handed a ticket. She said that she usually pays and was unable to do so today, but she did not elaborate.</p><p>“This is crazy,” she said. “Are they doing this to everyone?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/ny-metropolitan-transportation-authority">N.Y.
