Mr. Chen was charged along with another man, Lu Jianwang, also known as Harry Lu.</p><p>Federal prosecutors said that when the men learned of an investigation into the outpost, they destroyed text messages they had exchanged with their handler at China’s Ministry of Public Security in October 2022, around the time that the F.B.I. searched the six-story building in Chinatown that housed the operation.</p><p>In court, Mr. Chen admitted through an interpreter that he had “agreed with others to act as an agent of a foreign government” and that he was not registered as a foreign agent, as legally required. Mr. Lu has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. Both men are American citizens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As Mr. Chen spoke to the court, his son and daughter sat in the front row of the gallery watching.</p><p>The pleading on Wednesday is the latest in the Justice Department’s initiative to stop efforts by the Chinese government to wield its influence secretly across the United States. The efforts have been driven especially in recent years by the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, which has been headed by Breon Peace.</p><p>“A priority of my office has been to counteract the malign activities of foreign governments that violate our nation’s sovereignty by targeting local diaspora communities,” Mr. Peace said in a news release.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
