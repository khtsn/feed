Putin and his defense minister presided over a televised, annual meeting of the Russian military’s top brass. They held forth on NATO, Ukraine and issues as obscure as mortgages for service members.</p><p>But one topic went unmentioned: Syria.</p><p>Mr. Putin has yet to say anything in public about the collapse of his close ally, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria more than a week ago, even as Russia struggles to salvage what influence it can in the Middle East. The silence underscores the uncertainty surrounding the future of Russia’s military bases in Syria — and the overwhelming priority for the Kremlin that the war in Ukraine has become.</p><p>Mr. al-Assad’s fall is a painful topic right now in Moscow, said Anton Mardasov, a Moscow-based military analyst focusing on the Middle East. “It’s better not to say anything.”</p><p>Things were very different just a year ago, when Sergei K. Shoigu, then the defense minister, boasted at the same annual meeting that Russian troops remained deployed both in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian-populated enclave that Azerbaijan recaptured from Armenia last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph released by Russian state media shows participants of an expanded meeting of the Defense Ministry Board in Moscow on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Now Mr. al-Assad’s ouster could become an even greater setback to Mr. Putin’s efforts to revive Russia as a world power. Mr. Mardasov said a best-case scenario for Russia could be a scaled-down military presence at the Hmeimim air base and the Tartus naval base in the Mediterranean. That could allow Moscow to keep a refueling and staging point for limited military activity there and in Africa.</p><p>But that scenario wouldn’t fulfill Mr. Putin’s earlier, broader ambitions of projecting might on the doorstep of NATO. Russian nuclear-capable bombers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-middle-east-syria-government-and-politics-58469498915075e6fcc212107205f8af" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flew</a> training missions from Syria in 2021, a signal that Mr. Putin saw his military’s presence in the country as a bulwark in his global conflict with the West.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Now, Mr. Mardasov said, the security situation in Syria is likely to remain so tenuous that Russia wouldn’t be able to station nuclear-capable weaponry there even if it struck an agreement to hold on to its bases.</p><p>“Such outposts to threaten NATO’s southern flank are already 100 percent lost,” Mr. Mardasov said. “Even if they manage to keep a presence, it will be symbolic.”</p><p>To Mr. Putin, the outcome of the war in Ukraine has now become the biggest factor in Russia’s future security. And in that war, he believes he is winning, both on the battlefield and in his standoff with the West, as politicians skeptical of supporting Ukraine, led by President-elect Donald J. Trump, increasingly come to power.</p><p>The government in Germany, one of Ukraine’s largest supporters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/europe/germany-confidence-vote-scholz-snap-election.html" title="">collapsed on Monday</a>, and the cost of the war is one of the issues likely to dominate the upcoming election campaign. On Thursday, the leaders of the European Union’s 27 member countries are scheduled to meet in Brussels to discuss, among other things, a path forward in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian military vehicles on a road west of Homs, moving toward the Mediterranean Sea from their bases around the country on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In Syria, Russia has apparently been scaling down its presence in recent days, with convoys of troops that had been stationed across the country seen pulling back to Russia’s Hmeimim and Tartus bases. Satellite images last week showed Russian military equipment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/13/world/syria-news?smid=url-share#russia-military-syria" title="">being packed up for loading onto transport planes</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Russian officials have sought to engage with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the conservative Islamist group that led the rebel offensive that toppled Mr. al-Assad. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told reporters Monday that there had been “no final decisions” on the future of Russia’s military presence in Syria.</p><p>“We are in contact with representatives of the powers that currently control the situation in the country,” Mr. Peskov said. “All this will be determined in the course of the dialogue.”</p><p>Just hours before Mr. al-Assad fell on Dec. 8, Russia’s top diplomat, Sergey V. Lavrov, was still <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1883855" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">describing</a> the Syrian rebels as “terrorists.” In one sign of Russian hopes for rapprochement, one of the country’s most powerful men, the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, said that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham should be taken off Russia’s terror list.</p><p>Mr. Kadyrov, who rules the majority-Muslim Russian republic of Chechnya, also said that Chechen authorities were willing to go on joint patrols “with the Syrian law enforcement agencies.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>It’s not clear whether Moscow’s diplomacy will be enough, however, to allow Russia to keep a military presence. Some European Union officials <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-16/russia-should-leave-syria-before-eu-sanctions-lifted-dutch-say?srnd=homepage-asia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Monday</a> that they would seek to make Russia’s exit from Syria a condition of lifting sanctions on Syria.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A drone photo showed Syrians celebrating on Friday after Bashar al-Assad fled the country, in Umayyad Square, Damascus, Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Many foreign ministers emphasized that it should be a condition for the new leadership to eliminate Russian influence,” Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels.</p><p>But Mr. Putin made clear once more on Monday that Syria had become a secondary concern. In his speech to the military leadership, he claimed his troops “hold the strategic initiative” along the entire front line in Ukraine and that the flow of Russians volunteering to fight “is not stopping.”</p><p>It was fresh evidence that Mr. Putin believes he can outlast Ukraine on the battlefield, even as Mr. Trump promises to negotiate a peace deal to end the war. Mr. Putin’s defense minister, Andrei R. Belousov, said in Monday’s meeting that “ensuring victory” in the Ukraine war was the military’s top priority, but he said nothing about its plans or aims in the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Russian state television has sought to fill the silence with claims that Russia fulfilled its mission in Syria and that any instability there is now the West’s fault. On the marquee weekly news show on the Rossiya channel on Sunday, the host, Dmitri Kiselyov, said that Russia had made contact with “the leaders of the armed opposition” and that both sides were showing “mutual restraint.”</p><p>“Russia did all it could to leave calm and stability in Syria,” Mr. Kiselyov said. “Russia has now taken a pragmatic position.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rebel fighter walked through a stadium that was used by Syrian Air Force Intelligence, in Damascus on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Berlin, and Alina Lobzina from London.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
