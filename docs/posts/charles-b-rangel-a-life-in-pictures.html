Rangel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/nyregion/charles-rangel-dead.html" title="">died Monday at age 94</a>, leaving behind a larger-than-life legacy in Harlem, his birthplace and longtime home, which he represented in Congress for more than four decades.</p><p>To veterans, friends and Harlem residents who gathered on Monday for a Memorial Day lunch at American Legion Post 398, a few blocks from his home, he was just Charlie: a onetime member of the Legion post, a political powerhouse who always made himself accessible to his constituents.</p><p>Nadine Pittman, a longtime American Legion Auxiliary member and a lifelong Harlem resident, described Mr. Rangel as “down-to-earth with the people.”</p><p>“He’d take the time and talk to you,” Ms. Pittman said. “I loved him as a person.”</p><p>Mr. Rangel retired as the ninth-longest continuously serving member of the House of Representatives in U.S. history. He was part of a quartet of venerable Harlem politicians known as the Gang of Four.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Rangel was born and raised in Harlem and attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx until he dropped out to join the Army in 1948. He fought in the Korean War and was awarded a Bronze Star for valor after leading his all-Black unit to safety.</p><p>Mr. Rangel was elected in 1966 to the State Assembly. In 1970, he was voted into Congress, unseating Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a longtime incumbent.</p><p>He remained in Congress for more than four decades. In 1974, he became the first Black member of the Ways and Means Committee and then, more than three decades later, its first Black chairman. He lost that powerful post four years later, in 2010, after he was censured for ethical lapses, including tax improprieties and failing to disclose personal income. Despite the scandal, he continued to win re-election and stayed in Congress until his retirement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black-and-white photograph of Mr. Rangel as a younger man." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 732w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw/26met-rangel-photos-02-qmtw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1464w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/3ece4552-bcbd-5c49-97da-bfdb57afe541" decoding="async" width="600" height="839"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Rangel in 1970.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eddie Hausner/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Throughout his lengthy career, Mr. Rangel never left behind the Harlem neighborhood where he had been raised.

The two became dear friends, despite what Mr. Frieson described as “a difference of political opinion.”</p><p>“His political so-and-so is different than our friendship,” he said. “He was a hell of an individual.”</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Rangel stopped showing up at the post as frequently.
