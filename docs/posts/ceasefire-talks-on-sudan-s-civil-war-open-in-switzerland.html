By <a href="https://www.clingendael.org/publication/sudan-hunger-death" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one estimate</a> as many as 2.5 million Sudanese could die from hunger by the end of September.</p><p>Appalled at the scale of the war-induced catastrophe in Sudan, a sprawling country in northeastern Africa, American officials said it was urgent to begin the new peace drive, even if chances of a breakthrough seem slim.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, the paramilitary leader whose Rapid Support Forces are fighting the military, <a href="https://thesudantimes.com/sudan/rsf-leader-demands-intl-war-probe-reaffirms-commitment-to-peace/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reiterated on Monday</a> that his side would attend the talks. But after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/africa/sudan-assasination-attempt-general-burhan.html" title="">a drone strike appeared to target the army leadership</a> at a parade in eastern Sudan on July 31, the military chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, spurned the meeting.</p><p>“We will not retreat, we will not surrender and we will not negotiate,” General al-Burhan told troops.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Switzerland meeting picks up from talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/world/africa/sudan-army-cease-fire-talks.html?timespastHighlight=Sudan,Jeddah,talks?timespastHighlight=Sudan,Jeddah,talks?timespastHighlight=Sudan,Jeddah,talks" title="">failed to stop the fighting</a>. Even before the talks in Geneva could start, however, American officials sought to temper expectations.</p><p>Tom Perriello, the U.S. envoy to Sudan, said in an interview that his goal is to broker a cease-fire and to strike a deal for full humanitarian access across Sudan, where more than 10 million people have been forced from their homes and tens of thousands are estimated to have died.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sudanese Armed Forces troops during a military demonstration outside the city of Omdurman, in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>But if, as seems likely, one of the two forces fighting each other does not turn up, American officials hope to at least revive the moribund peace process and pressure both sides to come to the table. American diplomats also aim to generate a sense of global urgency about a ballooning humanitarian crisis whose relief efforts remain chronically underfunded, despite the severity of the problem.</p><p>“We need to start pivoting to a different set of solutions if we are to prevent a couple of million people from starving,” Mr. Perriello said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>As of Tuesday, the United Nations had received just one-third of the $2.7 billion it had requested for Sudan. People are dying because aid agencies lack funding, said Mohamed Refaat, country director with the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.</p><p>“We see people who are dying, and who we have access to, who we can’t do anything for,” Mr. Refaat said in a video call with reporters from the de facto capital, Port Sudan, where all government functions have been moved with Khartoum divided between the two sides.</p><p>The previous talks in Saudi Arabia ran aground after the Sudanese military refused to attend unless the R.S.F. abandoned most of its military gains since the war started in April 2023 — effectively a refusal to attend.</p><p>American officials began to also see the Saudis as part of the problem, saying they seemed to be doing little to encourage the talks to resume, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.</p></div></div><div><p>Some Saudi officials seemed to relish growing tension between the United States and Saudi Arabia’s own rival, the United Arab Emirates, over the military support that the Emiratis have continued to supply to the R.S.F., the two officials said.</p></div><div><div><p>At the talks in Geneva, Saudi officials will no longer be leading mediation efforts, and will instead be listed as “co-hosts” with Switzerland.</p><p>Despite American assurances that the talks will focus narrowly on a cease-fire, many Sudanese civilian leaders worry they could ultimately pave the way for a power-sharing deal between the warring generals whose feud is destroying the country, instead of leading to the democratic transition many once hoped for.</p><p>The talks carry risk for the United States, too. The Biden administration has already faced criticism from Sudanese and even former American officials that flawed diplomacy in 2022 set the stage for the outbreak of war in 2023.</p><p>“Well-intentioned but counterproductive diplomatic efforts” by the United States and others “at best, failed to prevent the war and at worst contributed to its outbreak,” Payton Knopf, a former American diplomat who participated in some of those efforts, <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/98554/sudan-diplomacy-fallacies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote this week</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Some Sudanese commentators have called the Geneva talks a “now or never” opportunity, noting that the chief organizer, Mr. Perriello, could be replaced, depending on the outcome of the presidential election in the United States.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed vehicles littered the road in a liberated area of Omdurman in April that was taken back by the Sudanese Armed Forces the previous month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Nick Cumming-Bruce<!-- --> contributed reporting from Geneva.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Declan Walsh is the chief Africa correspondent for The Times based in Nairobi, Kenya.
