E.U. car tariffs are currently set at 10 percent.</p><p>But at the same time, both she and the E.U. trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, made it clear that European officials were preparing to deploy tariffs and, potentially, other trade barriers to hit back at the United States if the two sides could not reach a deal. Those tariffs are set to begin within days.</p><p>European Union officials circulated on Monday evening in Brussels a list of products that they plan to hit with retaliatory tariffs, said Olof Gill, trade spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch. Representatives from across the bloc’s member states are expected to vote on that list on Wednesday. If approved, the fresh tariffs would take force in two waves — one on April 15, the second a month later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Officials did not immediately make the list public.</p><p>The tariffs would mark the E.U.’s first concrete reaction to Mr. Trump’s volley of recent trade measures. They would specifically respond to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs that took effect in mid-March, and officials have said they would be only a first step. European policymakers are contemplating how to react to Mr. Trump’s subsequent moves, including his 25 percent tariffs on automobiles and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/europe/tariffs-response-trump.html" title="">20 percent</a> across-the-board tariff on E.U. goods that he announced last week.</p><p>The bloc’s first set of retaliatory tariffs was expected to be sweeping, though somewhat dialed back from what was originally planned.</p><p>Officials had initially intended to hit about $28.4 billion worth of goods, and their preliminary list included imports like bourbon, boats, clothing and farm products.</p><p>But a senior E.U. official <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/180063de-15a8-4077-8daf-a6a591e117ec" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested on Monday</a> that bourbon might be dropped — it had emerged as a flashpoint after Mr. Trump threatened 200 percent tariffs on European wine and other alcohol in response. Mr. Sefcovic, the trade commissioner, said that the final tally of goods targeted would be smaller, after feedback from European member states.</p><p>Still, Europe’s gamble on simultaneously employing carrots and sticks to prod the Trump administration toward the negotiating table could have big reverberations for the world economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>If a deal is struck, it could foster more unrestrained trade flows between two of the world’s largest markets and most important trading partners. If the conflict instead leads to escalating tension and worsening relations, it could help fuel a trade war that causes painful fallout for consumers and companies on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>“We are fully prepared to sit at the negotiation table whenever our American partners are ready,” Mr. Sefcovic said on Monday in Luxembourg. He had what he described as <a href="https://x.com/MarosSefcovic/status/1908216093405024629" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “frank” two-hour meeting</a> with his American counterparts late last week.</p><p>“While the E.U. remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not wait,” he added. “We are prepared to use every tool in our trade defense arsenal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Brough Brothers Distillery in Louisville, Ky., last month.

It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/us-tariffs-eu-whiskey.html" title="">was instead delayed</a> for further refinement after Mr. Trump threatened his<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-tariff-european-union-whiskey.html" title=""> 200 percent tariff</a> on all European alcohol.</p><p>Such a move would be crushing for French and Italian winemakers, and policymakers from those countries voiced alarm.</p><p>Whiskey, which triggered that response, is now expected by many to be dropped from the final list. Stéphane Séjourné, an executive vice president of the European Commission, said during <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-industry-chief-stephane-sejourne-hopes-bourbon-spared-response-donald-trump-tariffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a radio interview</a> on Monday that he hoped for the “good news” that it would be cut. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The episode underscored the challenge in maintaining a firm and united front in responding to tariffs. Countries across the continent have different economic priorities and different appetites for hitting back at the United States.</p><p>Some Northern European countries have been adamant that the European Union must be forceful in its response — even pushing for the E.U. to use a powerful new trade tool to erect trade barriers on services, potentially targeting big American technology companies like Google.</p><p>But other European leaders have been more reluctant to hit back so hard. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has called the idea that Italy must choose between the United States and the bloc “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96d02345-1079-47d0-b208-1e80bcedf684" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">childish</a>.” She has also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f820e191-348c-4298-b15f-49600be843ce" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cautioned against</a> harsh retaliation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Two workers treating vineyards for weeds last month outside Épernay, France.
