This week, it has drifted as far north as Newfoundland and as far south as Florida. “There are some people who think this smoke could reach Europe,” said <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/stephane-bilodeau" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stéphane Bilodeau</a>, an adjunct professor specializing in air quality at McGill University in Quebec.</p><p>Winnipeg, the provincial capital of Manitoba, and Fort Smith, a small town in the Northwest Territories, reported the worst air quality in Canada on Friday morning, with levels in the “very high risk range,” according to the <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/airquality/pages/index_e.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian government</a>.</p><p>“Today is the worst day in Montreal of this week,” Mr. Bilodeau said. “Toronto has started to be very bad, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The worst of all is definitely Winnipeg due to its proximity to the fires in Manitoba,” he added. “It’s just a couple miles from the core of the fires.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The impacts from smoke were less severe in the United States on Friday compared with previous days, especially in the Northeast, but Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said more smoke was expected to push into the country this weekend.</p><p>“There’s another batch that could come down Saturday night into Sunday,” Mr. Chenard said.</p><p>In the United States on Friday, the worst smoke impacts were over the Great Lakes, with the air quality in Detroit being “very unhealthy,” between 100 and 140.</p><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/why-wildfire-smoke-health-concern" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warns</a> that wildfire smoke contains dangerous pollutants in the form of fine particles known as PM 2.5 that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Short-term exposure can lead to bronchitis, worsen asthma and create other health issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Peak wildfire season in Canada usually begins in June, but this year is proving to be an especially active start with fires growing large quickly.</p><p>“Definitely the start-up is a steep and severe one,” said Mr. Bilodeau.</p><p>On Friday, there were 212 wildfires burning across Canada, with most of those in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, according to the <a href="https://ciffc.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
