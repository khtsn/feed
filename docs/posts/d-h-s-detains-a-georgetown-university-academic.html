    <h1>D.H.S. Detains a Georgetown University Academic</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government detained an Indian citizen who was studying and teaching at Georgetown University, and said he had been deemed <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1902524674291966261" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“deportable”</a> for violating the terms of his student visa.</p><p>The academic, <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/developing-gu-researcher-detained-by-immigration-agents/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Badar Khan Suri</a>, was detained at his home in Rosslyn, Va., on Monday night, according to his lawyer, Hassan Ahmad. Mr. Suri was “awaiting his court date in immigration court” in Alexandria, La., Mr. Ahmad said. Tricia McLaughlin, a <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1902524674291966261" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spokeswoman</a> for the Department of Homeland Security, said Mr. Suri was “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.” Ms. McLaughlin didn’t provide any evidence to support the claim.</p><p>Mr. Ahmad said that Mr. Suri denied all of the allegations made in Ms. McLaughlin’s statement. He believed that the accusations against Mr. Suri were “seemingly based on who his father-in-law was,” but that he was still researching the case. Mr. Suri has no criminal record and has not been charged with a crime, according to Mr. Ahmad. Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/19/trump-deportation-georgetown-graduate-student-00239754" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported</a> on the news of Mr. Suri’s detention.</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin said that Mr. Suri had “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas,” and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had deemed him “deportable.”</p></div></div>
