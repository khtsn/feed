Mr. Suri was “awaiting his court date in immigration court” in Alexandria, La., Mr. Ahmad said. Tricia McLaughlin, a <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1902524674291966261" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spokeswoman</a> for the Department of Homeland Security, said Mr. Suri was “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.” Ms. McLaughlin didn’t provide any evidence to support the claim.</p><p>Mr. Ahmad said that Mr. Suri denied all of the allegations made in Ms. McLaughlin’s statement. He believed that the accusations against Mr. Suri were “seemingly based on who his father-in-law was,” but that he was still researching the case. Mr. Suri has no criminal record and has not been charged with a crime, according to Mr. Ahmad. Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/19/trump-deportation-georgetown-graduate-student-00239754" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported</a> on the news of Mr. Suri’s detention.</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin said that Mr. Suri had “close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas,” and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had deemed him “deportable.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. McLaughlin said Mr. Suri was detained under a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which the administration is using to try and deport Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate and legal permanent resident who had a prominent role in the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia.</p><p>The measure says the Secretary of State can initiate deportation proceedings against any noncitizen whose presence in the United States he deems a threat to the country’s foreign policy interests. Mr. Trump had said earlier this month Mr. Khalil’s case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-crackdown-dissent.html" title="">was the first of “many to come.”</a> Civil Rights groups have said such arrests against immigrants with some form of legal status are a clear violation of the First Amendment.</p><p>While both men were deemed to be deportable under the same statute, Mr. Suri was studying in the United States on a J-1 student visa while Mr. Khalil had a green card.</p><p>Georgetown University, where Mr. Suri was a postdoctoral fellow, said in a statement that it was not aware of Mr. Suri “engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention.”</p><p>“Seeing our government abduct and jail another innocent person is beyond contemptible,” Mr. Ahmad said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Smugglers Found Guilty: </strong>Two men were convicted for their role in the deaths of 53 undocumented migrants, one of the deadliest migrant smuggling incidents in the nation’s history.
