The main body of the helicopter plummeted into the water on the western side of the river near Jersey City, N.J., and then floated upside down.</p><p>The passengers — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/world/europe/hudson-river-helicopter-crash-dead-spain-siemens-agustin-escobar.html" title="">Agustín Escobar, Mercè Camprubí Montal and their three young children, Agustín, Mercè and Víctor</a> — were all killed.

The agency said that, after the crash, the company’s director of operations, Jason Costello, had said it would suspend operations. But within half an hour, Mr. Roth contacted the agency to say he had not authorized a suspension of operations and that Mr. Costello no longer worked for him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The F.A.A. called the “intentional firing” of Mr. Costello a retaliation and determined that it left the company without “sufficient qualified management and technical personnel to ensure the safety of its operations.”</p><p>The transportation safety board said that its efforts to recover pieces of the helicopter had concluded. But its investigation is just getting underway.</p><p>The safety board’s staff will conduct interviews and study the wreckage and the operator’s maintenance records to try to determine why the helicopter had broken apart. Its investigations often take several months and sometimes are not concluded for more than a year.</p><p>On Tuesday, the safety board is holding a hearing to discuss its final report on a fire aboard a ship in Newark, in which two members of Newark’s fire department died. That fire happened in July 2023.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the economy of New York City and its airports and other transportation hubs.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
