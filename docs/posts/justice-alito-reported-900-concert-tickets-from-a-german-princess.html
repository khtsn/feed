Alito Jr. reported a single gift: $900 concert tickets from a German princess known for her links to conservative activists.</p><p>The disclosure does not list the event’s details, including the concert’s name, location or how many tickets the princess provided.

Bannon</a>, the longtime ally of former President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>The disclosure only heightened the scrutiny around ethics at the Supreme Court, which has been in the spotlight after revelations that some of its members, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most notably Justice Clarence Thomas</a>, accepted luxury gifts and travel from wealthy benefactors without disclosing the largess on their mandatory annual financial forms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“No matter the identity of the patron — whether it be a German princess, Queen Bey or the king of Dallas real estate — the justices should not be accepting expensive gifts,” Gabe Roth, who leads Fix the Court, an organization that has been critical of transparency on the court, said in response to Justice Alito’s disclosure. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Justice Samuel A.

She has also played matchmaker between Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a German cardinal whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/world/europe/vatican-pope-doctrine-mueller.html" title="">Francis fired</a> from his position as the church’s top doctrinal watchdog, and Mr. Bannon, who has built relationships with far-right political parties in Germany and France.</p><p>Mr. Bannon has met with leaders of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party and has spoken of his plans to create a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d38ffde2-6bf6-11e9-a9a5-351eeaef6d84" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“gladiator school”</a> for the training of Catholics hostile to Francis.</p><p>Mr. Bannon could not be immediately reached for comment on Sunday.

She also published a book of conversations with Cardinal Joachim Meisner, who had been known for his outspoken conservative views, including attempts to ban abortion in Germany, before his death in 2017.</p><p>Her statements and religious views have created controversies around her, including in 2019, when El Museo del Barrio in Harlem, the oldest museum in the United States focused on Latino art, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/design/el-museo-del-barrio-princess-gloria-von-thurn-und-taxis.html#:~:text=Princess%20Gloria%20was%20reported%20to,was%20the%20continent&#39;s%20intense%20heat." title="">withdrew its decision</a> to honor her at its 50th anniversary gala.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The princess said in an email at the time that she was “disappointed to what degree the society is divided today and that there seems to be absolutely no room for tolerance whatsoever.”</p><p>She added that her “conservative religious views have absolutely no impact” on her “open mind on cultural diversity and inclusion,” and that she had “been friends with all sorts of people of different political and religious views all my life.”</p><p>Later that year, in October, the princess met at the Supreme Court with Justice Alito, along with Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Cardinal Müller and Brian S. Brown, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/us/politics/brian-brown-fights-same-sex-marriage-with-zeal-and-strategy.html" title="">prominent anti-L.G.B.T.Q. activist</a>, according to <a href="https://profam.org/cardinal-muller-the-supreme-court-and-the-white-house/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a photo and post on the website</a> for the International Organization for the Family.</p><p>Mr. Brown is <a href="https://profam.org/leadership/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed as the president of the group</a>, which says its mission is “to unite and equip leaders, organizations and families to affirm, celebrate and defend the natural family as the only fundamental and sustainable unit of society.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times.
