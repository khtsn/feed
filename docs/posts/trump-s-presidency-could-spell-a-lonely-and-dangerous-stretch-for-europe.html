Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency could spell a lonely and dangerous stretch for Europe, which is already mired in economic stagnation and rattled by war on its eastern doorstep. It is a moment that European leaders agree demands renewed and forceful leadership from the continent’s two largest economies.</p><p>But France and Germany, which are also the European Union’s most important countries, are struggling to answer the call. They themselves are falling victim to the same political forces that helped Mr. Trump gain popularity among conservatives and swing voters in the United States. Among them: backlash against rapid consumer price increases; anxiety and anger over increased immigration; and the rapid erosion of public trust in political elites.</p><p>Mainstream political parties have bled support. Populists and nationalists, including once-fringe parties on the far right, have surged.</p><p>After months of infighting over taxes, spending and how best to reinvigorate Germany’s economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz scuttled his governing coalition this past week by firing his wayward finance minister. The country appears headed toward early elections, which seem likely to oust Mr. Scholz from power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A far-right party and a new populist party gained ground in recent regional elections, and Mr. Trump’s victory could further boost their credibility against mainstream parties in the coming federal election.</p><p>In France, President Emmanuel Macron has seen his power wane in the aftermath of a calamitous decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/world/europe/france-macron-elections-analysis.html" title="">call snap elections</a> this year.
