Supporters of the government view Mr. Bar as disloyal to Mr. Netanyahu, but critics consider his removal a dangerous precedent that undermines the independence of democratic institutions.</p><p>The hearing, which was broadcast live in Israel, opened with unruly scenes as hecklers, including a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, forced the judges to pause the proceedings and then resume them without a public audience. The lawmaker, Tally Gotliv, had to be forcibly removed from the courtroom.</p><p>The hearing lasted almost 11 hours and ended with the issuing of an interim order against Mr. Bar’s dismissal. The judges gave <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/israel-attorney-general.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">the attorney general</a> and the government until April 20 to come up with a “creative solution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The court stipulated that Mr. Bar was to remain in his job for now.</p><h2 id="link-6a917517">What’s the case?</h2><p>Last month, Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-ronen-bar.html" title="">fired Mr. Bar</a>, saying that he no longer trusted him. Critics say Mr. Netanyahu fired Mr. Bar to try to seize greater power by purging a dissenting voice from Israel’s security establishment.</p><p>As head of the Shin Bet, Mr. Bar helped to spearhead Israel’s war in Gaza and to oversee the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/world/middleeast/west-bank-what-where-who.html" title="">occupation of the West Bank</a>. He was also one of a handful of senior officials who led cease-fire negotiations with Hamas to release dozens of hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that ignited the war.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
