Trump announced on Saturday that he would name Charles Kushner, the wealthy real estate executive and father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France, handing one of his earliest and most high-profile ambassador appointments to a close family associate.</p><p>The announcement was the latest step in a long-running exchange of political support between the two men. Mr. Kushner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/us/politics/trump-pardon-manafort-stone.html" title="">received a pardon</a> from Mr. Trump in the final days of his first term for a variety of violations and then emerged as a major donor to Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign.</p><p>“I am pleased to nominate Charles Kushner, of New Jersey, to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to France,” Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post announcing his choice. “He is a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, &amp; dealmaker, who will be a strong advocate representing our Country &amp; its interests.”</p><p>Mr. Kushner, 70, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/nyregion/major-donor-admits-hiring-prostitute-to-smear-witness.html" title="">pleaded guilty in 2004</a> to 16 counts of tax evasion, a single count of retaliating against a federal witness and one of lying to the Federal Election Commission in a case that became a lasting source of embarrassment for the family. As part of the plea, Mr. Kushner admitted to hiring a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, a witness in a federal campaign finance investigation, and sending a videotape of the encounter to his sister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump granted Mr. Kushner clemency as part of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/us/politics/trump-pardon-manafort-stone.html" title="">wave of 26 pardons</a> he issued with roughly a month left in his first term, along with other close associates including Paul Manafort, his 2016 campaign chairman, and Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime ally and informal adviser.</p><p>In addition to securing a pardon for himself, Mr. Kushner was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/us/politics/trump-pardon-braun.html" title="">instrumental in helping others seeking clemency</a> elevate their cases, relying on his son as a bridge to help get applications in front of Mr. Trump.</p><p>The case against Mr. Kushner was prosecuted by Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who was then a U.S. attorney. Mr. Christie has since become a vocal critic of Mr. Trump’s and continued to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/us/politics/chris-christie-charles-kushner.html" title="">describe Mr. Kushner’s transgressions</a> as severe.</p><p>Mr. Kushner served two years in prison before his release in 2006.</p><p>While widely seen as one of the most prized ambassador positions, the role Mr. Kushner will be nominated for could be complicated by the at times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/politics/trump-nato-summit.html" title="">standoffish position</a> Mr. Trump took toward President Emmanuel Macron of France during his first term.</p><p>As president, Mr. Trump also expressed support for Mr. Macron’s far-right challenger in the 2017 French presidential election, Marine Le Pen, whose hard-line stance against immigration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/europe/france-election-marine-le-pen-trump.html" title="">Mr. Trump praised</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Macron, who has been a staunch supporter of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Ukraine, will serve until mid-2027. Mr. Trump has repeatedly questioned the value of Western support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, and has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/world-war-i-trump-macron.html" title="">publicly sparred with Mr. Macron</a> over other contentious policy disagreements, including trade issues and the U.S. withdrawal from a nuclear deal with Iran.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>24</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Trump Picks the Father of His Son-in-Law to Serve as the Ambassador to France<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
