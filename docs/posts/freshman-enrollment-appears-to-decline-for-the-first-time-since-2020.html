That in turn held up the rollout of financial aid offers well into the summer, leaving many families struggling to determine how much college would cost.</p><p>By itself, the enrollment data does not establish that errors with the FAFSA form caused a significant number of students to postpone college out of frustration with the process or to choose lower-cost alternatives to four-year schools, such as community colleges or two-year degree programs.</p><p>But the numbers released on Wednesday highlighted a drop in freshman enrollment, particularly at schools serving students from lower-income families that disproportionately depend on federal aid to afford college.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Most significantly, the data indicated that both public and private four-year schools that admit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/07/magazine/college-access-index.html" title="">the largest shares of students receiving Pell grants</a> saw freshman enrollment dip by more than 10 percent from 2023 levels.</p><p>Pell grants provide a subsidy of up to $7,395 per year for low-income students and offer a financial boost for schools that disproportionately enroll lower-income students. The grants generally support families in the lower half of household income distribution — those earning $60,000 a year or less — but more than half have typically gone to students whose families earn less than $20,000 annually.</p><p>Increasing the maximum size of the Pell Grant for the 2024-2025 academic year has been celebrated by Education Department officials as one of the Biden administration’s proudest accomplishments. At the urging of department officials, lawmakers increased the maximum award by $900 total, up from $6,495 in 2022.</p><p>But the steep drop-off in freshman enrollment at schools with the largest populations of lower income students suggested that far fewer incoming students were able to take advantage of the more generous award this year, and that any positive financial impact on those schools was blunted by the decline.</p><p>Doug Shapiro, the executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, said that a variety of factors, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/us/politics/supreme-court-admissions-affirmative-action-harvard-unc.html" title="">Supreme Court decision</a> last year ending race-conscious admissions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/13/business/college-dropout-debt.html" title="">anxiety over excessive student debt</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/business/economy/job-market-hiring-wage.html" title="">a strong labor market</a> may have all played some role affecting individual decisions about college, and it was unclear to what extent headaches with FAFSA may have contributed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But based on observations from the downturn in 2020, Mr. Shapiro said that when high school seniors deferred college that year, only an “infinitesimal” number returned in the years after, leaving a permanent dent in enrollment. For that reason, he said, there was little evidence that the numbers would bounce back next year with more students than usual flocking back to college.</p><p>“Life happens,” Mr. Shapiro told reporters during a call on Tuesday. “These students end up with jobs and sometimes families, and they find it harder and harder as time goes on to think about entering college again.”</p><p>Ahead of the report, the Education Department <a href="https://sites.ed.gov/ous/2024/10/early-data-indicate-more-students-are-on-track-to-receive-federal-financial-aid-this-year/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> its own analysis on Tuesday, stating that the total number of students it expects to receive federal student aid has risen by 3 percent since 2023 and that 10 percent more students are on track to receive a Pell grant this year.</p><p>But in its report, the department acknowledged that it received 2 percent fewer applications for federal student aid this year compared to the year before and said “that gap is larger for high school seniors and other first-time filers.”</p><p>The data in the report on Wednesday was based on enrollment numbers from just over half of all U.S. colleges and universities, which together account for around nine million students, and the final numbers may vary as more colleges report their freshman class sizes this semester.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While the report shows declines among students age 18 to 20 who did not start school this year, it nonetheless found that undergraduate enrollment was up by about 3 percent over all, driven in part by an increase in high school-age students taking college courses.</p><p>It also found that enrollment in associate degree programs is growing and that the fastest growth occurred among undergraduate certificate seekers, with enrollment in those programs up by 7.3 percent this year.</p><p>“The gains among students either continuing from last year or returning from prior stop outs are keeping overall undergraduate numbers growing, especially at community colleges, and that’s at least some good news for students and schools alike,” Mr. Shapiro said in a statement accompanying the report.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
