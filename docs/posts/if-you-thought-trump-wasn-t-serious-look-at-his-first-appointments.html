In July a Mexican-born Trump backer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-latino-voters-deportation.html" title="">told</a> The Times, “Last time, he didn’t even finish the wall. What’s he going to do this time?”</p><p>Now the answer is taking shape: He’s going to oversee a militarized mass roundup of the undocumented. On Sunday, Trump named Tom Homan, his former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as “border czar.” </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-nfyMCS9wo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> to this year’s National Conservatism Conference, Homan, who oversaw Trump’s family separation policy, promised a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-immigration-plans-deportation-e91b1bc4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“historic deportation operation”</a> from which no undocumented immigrant would be safe. “No one’s off the table in the next administration,” he said. “If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Then, on Monday, Trump named the obsessively anti-immigrant Stephen Miller as his deputy chief of staff. Miller’s portfolio, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" title="">reported</a> in The Times, “is expected to be vast and to far exceed what the eventual title will convey.” Miller has been forthright about his desire to purge immigrants here illegally, as well as many here legally, from the United States.</p><p>Among other things, Miller has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">said</a> that Trump would cancel the temporary protected status of thousands of Afghans who fled here after the Taliban’s takeover and take another stab at ending DACA, the program that protects from deportation some immigrants brought to the United States as children.</p><p>Most significantly, he’s laid out plans to use National Guard troops to help arrest migrants en masse, warehousing them in military camps while they await deportation. No one should be shocked when this happens. I suspect some will be anyway.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michelle Goldberg has been an Opinion columnist since 2017.
