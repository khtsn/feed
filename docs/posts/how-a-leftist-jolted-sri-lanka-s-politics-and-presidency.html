A third contender, the incumbent, was the nephew and political heir of yet another president.</p><p>But when Anura Kumara Dissanayake arrived at the election commission office late Sunday to accept his victory in the vote, he cut a different figure, his sleeves rolled up and his beige shirt tucked into simple blue jeans.</p><p>His sweep to power is the biggest jolt to Sri Lanka’s political landscape in decades — an emphatic rejection of the political elite that had long ruled the island nation. He rode a wave of discontent that crested in 2022 with a popular uprising over an economic collapse and continued until the first presidential election since then.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Dissanayake, 55, offered his broad leftist coalition as the best hope for a different political culture. He cast it as an alternative for a country with an aspiring middle class that is hungry for competent economic leadership that the old political system, rife with nepotism and corruption, did not provide.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters taking control of the Sri Lankan prime minister’s office in Colombo in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atul Loke for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His personal story resonated: The son of a farmer and a homemaker, he worked as a tutor, sold cigarettes on trains and hawked vegetables in his village market before committing to politics. He vowed to clean up the patronage networks that had enriched a small elite while the fortunes of the majority stagnated and then plummeted as the country’s economy disintegrated.</p><p>“They think that the family power they have obtained from ruling the country for a long time will bring them victory,” Mr. Dissanayake said at one of his final rallies. “It is the people’s power that will definitely win.”</p><p>His government faces a hard road ahead. The country’s economy, while stabilized after the long fuel and food lines of two years ago, continues to suffer from deep structural flaws: too much spending, and too little taxation and revenue. And there are no easy fixes.</p><p>Austerity measures have added to the suffering of the poor, with a quarter of the country’s population of 23 million below the poverty line. Corruption and patronage won’t be easily rooted out. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/world/asia/sri-lanka-suicide-civil-war-mental-illness.html" title="">ethnic prejudices</a> that led to a 26-year civil war remain largely unaddressed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For decades, temporary covers — from majoritarian ethnic nationalism to the economic boost from heavy spending at the end of the civil war — papered over anger at “the decadence of this political elite,” said Nirmal Dewasiri, a professor of history at the University of Colombo, in Sri Lanka’s capital.</p><p>The economic collapse two years ago, Dr. Dewasiri added, awakened the country to how deep and structural the political rot was.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Negombo’s fish market on Sri Lanka’s eastern coast in January.

The two traditional political camps “have sort of broken down.”</p><p>Power in Sri Lanka long alternated between two dominant parties until one of them, the center-right United National Party, entrenched itself in the 1970s and ruled for 17 years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The party’s consolidation of power and crackdown on dissenting voices helped lead to violent insurrections — the three-decade Tamil insurgency in the north, and repeated violent Communist insurrections in the south. New coalitions and networks formed in an effort to topple the U.N.P.</p><p>Another reality was also emerging. While established politics long relied on rural patronage, the country was developing a new urban and semi-urban middle class that was looking beyond party structures for a path to prosperity.</p><p>The Rajapaksa family stepped into this moment of churn, tapping into the nationalism of the majority Buddhist Sinhalese population to rule for 10 years under its patriarch, Mahinda Rajapaksa. When his tenure ran its course, a second Rajapaksa brother, Gotabaya, ascended to power in 2019 with a campaign intended to appeal to the urban middle class.</p><p>He pitched himself as a technocratic “nonpolitician” who was at once an insider and an outsider, a former army officer who was returning from living in the United States. As a candidate he held a series of symposiums around the country where professionals would offer solutions to problems.</p><p>But Sri Lanka’s economic crisis and the resulting protests that forced out Mr. Rajapaksa, provided an opening for other political forces that had spent years organizing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mahinda Rajapaksa, left, and his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in Colombo in 2020.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Many of the things that we would have been speaking about in the past I think began to make sense to people — that, primarily, the problem in the country stems from the political culture, corruption, nepotism, the patronage system,” Harini Amarasuriya, an academic and activist who is a senior leader of Mr. Dissanayake’s alliance, said in an interview before the vote.</p><p>On Tuesday, Dr. Amarasuriya was appointed as Sri Lanka’s new prime minister. While she is the third woman to hold the post, women’s representation in Parliament still remains just 5 percent. The two previous female prime ministers both came from a political dynasty.</p><p>Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the Marxist party that Mr. Dissanayake helped lead to power as part of a broader coalition, is drastically different today than when he joined it as a student leader in the 1980s.</p><p>Thousands were killed in violence between J.V.P. insurgents and Sri Lankan government forces. Mr. Dissanayake’s own family home was burned, and the family was forced to live in a relative’s kitchen. A cousin his parents had raised almost as a sibling to Mr. Dissanayake was shot dead not far from him. He kept this news from his family for a decade, he said; they kept a vigil and visited temples to pray for his return.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In Sinhalese Buddhist culture, families keep a horoscope that, based on planetary alignments, predicts their child’s future. Past leaders, particularly the Rajapaksas, emphasized astrology in political life. When Mr. Dissanayake was asked in a recent interview whether his horoscope had predicted his rise, he was blunt.</p><p>“In 1989, our house was burned. My horoscope got burned with it, and I haven’t made a new horoscope since then. I don’t believe in horoscopes,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWBNavZubu8&amp;t=290s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>. “My parents didn’t have big dreams — their world wasn’t that big. The biggest hope my mother had for me was the teaching profession. That was their world.”</p><p>The J.V.P. spent decades trying to distance itself from the violence and radical communism of its past. With the stigma not yet fully gone, Mr. Dissanayake ran under the name of his coalition, the National People’s Power. Though the coalition retained the J.V.P. at its core, it brought in academics and activists like Dr. Amarasuriya who had none of the old political baggage and could better articulate an alternative vision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Dissanayake, center, in Colombo in 2015, after submitting nominations to run in coming parliamentary elections.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ishara S.Kodikara/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The alliance vowed to change the political culture within existing frameworks. It reached out to young people and women who had long been on the political margins. It ensured “a feminist sensitivity” by putting female voices in its leadership and mobilizing female voters, Dr. Amarasuriya said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Two years before, it had been young people and women who spilled into the streets as the economy cratered.</p><p>“Although the husband might bring the money, the women felt the brunt more because they run the kitchen,” said Hiranthi Boralessa, 59, a teacher in the southern district of Galle.</p><p>She had been married to a J.V.P. leader for over three decades but had only now gotten directly involved in political organizing.</p><p>Her husband, Dharmawardhana Munasinghe, 69, a retired reacher, was part of the earliest leadership of the J.V.P. His detention at an army camp, and his cat-and-mouse game with the authorities for nearly a decade after, complicated their young romance. Their wedding had to wait for a decade, and it eventually happened at a small, hushed ceremony in Colombo.</p><p>Mr. Munasinghe said that in all the decades after the party distanced itself from the violence, it had remained a marginal player in Galle. But he said the landscape changed entirely after the 2022 protest movement, with the local cells of the two main parties discredited over the economic collapse and hated for years of impunity for local abuses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hiranthi Boralessa, right, and her husband Dharmawardhana Munasinghe at their home in Galle, Sri Lanka, last week.
