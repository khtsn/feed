</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested that earlier proposals by the government to introduce hard-line tariffs on trading partners were likely to be softened as negotiations progressed, and that this could offer a tailwind for the stock market.</p><p>Investors are squarely focused on whether the economy can withstand the current period of fading growth expectations and rising recession worries, at least until more business-friendly policies like tax cuts and deregulation are settled on and there is more certainty around tariffs.</p><p>At the beginning of March, investors expected the Fed to next cut interest rates in June, based on prices in interest rate futures markets. As of Tuesday, those expectations had been pushed back six weeks to July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But certain interest rates have started to come down even without Fed action. As growth worries have mounted, longer-dated market interest rates have fallen, making things like mortgages and auto loans cheaper.</p><p>In effect, this decline is doing some of the same job that the Fed’s cutting interest rates would do and is buying the central bank some time while inflation remains sticky.</p><p>Lower interest rates are typically seen as being beneficial for the stock market, but the recent decline in rates has not helped lift companies’ share prices</p><p>When rates fall because of fundamental concerns about the economy, the forecast for the companies in the stock market is also gloomy and their valuations typically fall.</p><p>The clouds have been gathering over corporate America. Chief executives from businesses like Delta Air Lines, Dollar General and Macy’s are warning that consumers have begun to struggle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And retail sales in February were lower than expected, with January’s preliminary figure revised down in the latest data.</p><p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s growth forecast for the first quarter is minus 1.8 percent.</p><p>The U.S. dollar is 4 percent lower just in March, on course for its worst month since November 2022. As the dollar weakens, the impact of President Trump’s tariffs on domestic companies and consumers intensifies. Investors have sought out the safety of gold, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/gold-price-record-high.html#:~:text=Gold%20Price%20Passes%20%243%2C000%2C%20a,Anxiety%20%2D%20The%20New%20York%20Times" title="">rose past $3,000 per troy ounce</a> this week for the first time.</p><p>Foreign investors have already begun to pivot away from U.S. markets. Analysts at Bank of America said their latest global survey of fund managers showed a sharp drop in the rosy expectations that they had started the year with, but not yet to the point that they were expecting a recession, even though worries over a possible downturn had risen. Analysts labeled the current sentiment a “bull crash.”</p><p>Should Fed officials signal on Wednesday that they are becoming more concerned about the economy and that the “dot plot” of interest rate forecasts suggests deeper cuts than investors expect, the stock market could fall even further.</p><p>Futures on the S&amp;P 500, which give investors the ability to trade before exchanges officially open, pointed to a modest rise on Wednesday, paring some of its 1 percent slide on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The Fed seems committed to sitting on its hands for the time being, but the dot plot will force them to ‘guesstimate’ whether they’ll cut rates this year and by how much,” said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Invesco. “With so much up in the air, it’ll be interesting to see their expectations.”</p><p>Mr. Colyar at Moody’s is among those who expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady until the second half of the year, when he expects the mounting tariff war to have slowed growth to the point that the central bank takes action.</p><p>“The timing for those moves will inch closer if the economy starts flashing red,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
