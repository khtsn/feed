The bet paid off. Nvidia now accounts for the majority of A.I. chip sales and has become the second-most-valuable company in the world, slightly trailing Apple at $3.32 trillion after trading hours on Friday.</p><p>Intel, which makes the chips that serve as the brains of most computers, once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/technology/intel-ai-chips-mistakes.html" title="">considered buying Nvidia</a>. But its board resisted the acquisition, and Nvidia went on to become a dominant player in the A.I. boom while Intel struggled to keep up. Intel’s market capitalization has fallen below $1 trillion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The thing that we understood is that this is a reinvention of how computing is done,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive and one of its founders, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/nvidia-ai-chips-gpu.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> last year. “And we built everything from the ground up, from the processor all the way up to the end.”</p><p>A recent stock split at Nvidia prompted speculation that it would replace Intel on the Dow Jones. In June, Nvidia unveiled a 10-for-one stock split that would make it easier for a retail investor to buy into the company without diluting its valuation.</p><p>Spokeswomen for Nvidia and Intel declined to comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
