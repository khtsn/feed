Trump erases her lead in Pennsylvania and maintains his advantage in Arizona.</p><p>It has been decades since the polls have shown the nation facing a presidential race that is so close across so many states in both the Sun Belt and the Rust Belt. The tightly contested landscape means the race remains highly uncertain as the campaign enters its final hours.</p><p>Ms. Harris is now narrowly ahead in Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin, the polls show, while Mr. Trump leads in Arizona. The polls show them locked in close races in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania. But the results in all seven states are within the margin of sampling error, meaning neither candidate has a definitive lead in any of them.</p><p><em>[While the overall poll result is largely unchanged since previous Times/Siena polls, there were some notable shifts, </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/upshot/polls-harris-trump-battlegrounds.html" title=""><em>Nate Cohn writes.</em></a><em>]</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Both candidates have multiple pathways available to capture the 270 Electoral College votes required to claim victory, assuming that polls are not dramatically underestimating the support for one or the other.

(With Election Day nearing, 11 percent of voters remained undecided or persuadable, down from 16 percent about a month ago.)</p><p>The polling comes as more than 70 million Americans have already voted, according to the University of Florida Election Lab.</p><p>Roughly 40 percent of those surveyed by the Times/Siena poll across the seven states said they had voted.

The economy still remains their top concern, but in states like Wisconsin, where Ms. Harris has held a consistent edge, abortion now nearly matches the economy as votersâ most important issue. And in Arizona, where Mr. Trump leads, immigration also continues to rise as a crucial issue driving votersâ choices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-10"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="final-states-sunbelt" data-id="100000009800537" data-source-id="100000009800537"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">How Polls in the Sun Belt States Compare</h2></header><div slug="final-states-sunbelt" data-sourceid="100000009800537" id="embed-id-100000009800537">

Overall, more than 98 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for these polls. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/03/us/elections/times-siena-battleground-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">here</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For these polls, interviewers placed about 850,000 calls to more than 320,000 voters.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of respondents and the weighted sample at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/03/us/elections/times-siena-battleground-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">results and methodology page</a>, under âComposition of the Sample.â</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The margin of sampling error among likely voters is plus or minus 1.3 percentage points across the seven battleground states and about plus or minus 3.5 percentage points in each state poll. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When the difference between two values is computed â such as a candidateâs lead in a race â the margin of error is twice as large.</p></li></ul><p>The Times/Siena polls of Pennsylvania in 2024 were conducted in partnership with the Philadelphia Inquirer and were funded in part by a grant from the Lenfest Institute for Journalism. The poll was designed and conducted independently from the institute.</p><p>You can see full results and a detailed methodology <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/03/us/elections/times-siena-battleground-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">here</a>.
