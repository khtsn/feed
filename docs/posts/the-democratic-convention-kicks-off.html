Hamas officials did not immediately comment, but they have called the mediators’ proposal fundamentally slanted toward Israel.</p><p>In Tel Aviv, the Israeli police said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/tel-aviv-bomb-hamas.html?smid=url-share" title="">a “powerful explosive” had detonated</a> on a road in the south of the city, injuring one passerby. Hamas’s military wing and Islamic Jihad took responsibility for what they said was a suicide bombing, and they threatened further attacks.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russian prisoners of war inside a Ukrainian prison cell.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Guttenfelder for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-39efcee5">Ukraine aimed to entrap Russian troops </h2><p>Russian troops in the Kursk region near the border with Ukraine are at risk of becoming encircled, military analysts said. The assessment comes after Ukraine’s bombing over the weekend of bridges that are the only routes for resupply or retreat.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/europe/ukraine-attacks-russia-bridges-border.html" title="">The potential entrapment of Russian forces in the area</a> adds another challenge for Russia, after it was caught off guard by Ukraine’s startling incursion earlier this month. The operation has injected a new sense of optimism to Ukrainian forces that had been backpedaling for months elsewhere along the front line.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Santos was expelled from the House of Representatives last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-4bf4e9e3">George Santos pleaded guilty</h2><p>George Santos, the disgraced former Republican congressman from New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/george-santos-guilty-plea-court.html" title="">pleaded guilty</a> to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in federal court today. The plea allows Santos to avoid a trial on nearly two dozen charges for which he was facing as many as 22 years in prison. He agreed to pay nearly $375,000 in restitution and will almost certainly face prison time.</p><p>The plea offers a coda to one of the oddest sideshows in modern U.S. politics — the tale of a political underdog who catapulted to Congress in 2022 and whose career unraveled into a seemingly bottomless series of falsehoods.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-55bd377a">More top news</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Economy:</strong> Americans are increasingly worried <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/business/economy/fed-labor-jobs.html" title="">about losing their jobs</a>, the New York Fed found, as officials weigh potential interest rate cuts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Congress:</strong> The House G.O.P. made its formal impeachment case against President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/republican-impeachment-report-biden.html" title="">without proof</a> of any crimes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/long-island-flooding-rainfall-new-york.html" title="">A storm system dumped nearly 10 inches</a> of rain in some areas this weekend, causing flash floods and evacuations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business:</strong> Companies are stockpiling components and delaying expansions to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/business/china-us-trade-war.html" title="">prepare for tariff hikes that Trump has said he would implement</a> if elected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sicily:</strong> One person is dead and six are missing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/europe/italy-sicily-yacht-sinks.html" title="">after a yacht sank in a violent storm</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Science:</strong> Researchers used A.I. to develop individualized algorithms for deep-brain stimulation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/health/parkinsons-brain-pacemaker.html" title="">helping a skateboarder with Parkinson’s disease</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health:</strong> In huge numbers, older people are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/health/gabapentin-seniors-pain.html" title="">taking gabapentin for a variety of conditions</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Space:</strong> The blue supermoon, probably the decade’s last, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/science/rare-august-blue-supermoon.html" title="">will be visible through Wednesday</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Phil Donahue in 1993.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Lennihan/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-2d8b0e4">Remembering Phil Donahue</h2><p>For years, Phil Donahue, who died on Sunday at 88, was known as the unchallenged king of daytime talk television. “The Phil Donahue Show,” which began in the late 1960s, dispensed with familiar trappings like the opening monologue and band. Instead, Donahue turned the show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/arts/television/phil-donahue-dead.html" title="">into a participation event</a>. </p><p>He would stalk the aisles, microphone in hand, soliciting questions and comments from the audience. Few subjects, if any, were off limits — they were as high-minded as human rights and international relations, and as lowbrow as male strippers and safe-sex orgies. “I want all the topics hot,” he is said to have told his staff. </p><p>These three episodes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/arts/television/phil-donahue-show-episodes.html" title="">explain his daytime dominance</a>. </p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fran Doran, 79, went scuba diving in Thailand with her granddaughter, who took this picture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Grace McGrath</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Working on a farm in the Peruvian Amazon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marco Garro for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linda Xiao for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cristina Daura</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-68f74e11">Confessions of a hate-watcher </h2><p>Our critic Alissa Wilkinson loves to hate-watch: picking apart TV shows that are expensively made yet irritating to sit through.
