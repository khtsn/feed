Mexican officials do not typically reveal the full names of crime victims in order not to obstruct investigations.</p><p>Prosecutors said the man had been born in the United States and the woman was a naturalized American born in Mexico. Ms. Guzmán said there was no immediate information about why the couple had been targeted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The authorities learned of the attack after security officers found the couple’s bullet-ridden vehicle on a street in Angamacutiro. Inside was the body of the woman, who died at the scene, officials said. The man, found alive but gravely wounded, was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died early Thursday, Ms. Guzmán said.</p><p>A spokesman with the United States Embassy in Mexico said officials were “aware of the situation” and tracking it closely. The State Department said in a statement: “We are aware of reports of the death of two U.S. citizens in Michoacán, Mexico. We are working to gather more information and stand ready to provide consular assistance if needed.”</p><p>The killings followed a series of bloody episodes in Angamacutiro, which borders Guanajuato, one of Mexico’s most violent states, northwest of Mexico City. In late October, men armed with assault rifles <a href="https://aristeguinoticias.com/2810/mexico/ejecutan-a-jefa-de-la-policia-de-angamacutiro-michoacan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assassinated</a> the town’s police chief. The town’s former mayor, Maribel Juárez Blanquet, <a href="https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/reportan-desaparicion-de-maribel-juarez-blanquet-exalcaldesa-de-angamacutiro-michoacan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was abducted</a> earlier this year and remains missing. Her brother, a local congressman, was gunned down in 2020.</p><p>“It is not easy for me to have nine bodyguards, to ride in an armored car — it is not a luxury; it is a necessity,” Ms. Juárez Blanquet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nmas.com.mx/videos/candidata-de-angamacutiro-michoac%C3%A1n-amenazada-de-muerte/491818095264735/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> a crowd at a rally in 2021, when she ran for re-election as mayor. “Despite the threats that have been made against me, I will not give up.”</p><p>Several bouts of violence — an ongoing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/world/americas/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-war.html" title="">turf war</a> in the northern state of Sinaloa, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/americas/chilpancingo-mayor-beheaded-mexico-arrest.html" title="">beheading</a> of a mayor and the fatal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/americas/mexico-fatal-shooting-migrants.html" title="">shooting of migrants</a> by Mexican soldiers — have marred the first few months in office of Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who was voted in on promises to tackle the bloodshed racking the country from north to south.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Rest assured that we are going to bring crime rates down,” Ms. Sheinbaum told the country’s governors in a security meeting held on Tuesday in the resort city of Acapulco, where she described her administration’s efforts to keep violence at bay.</p><p>Ms. Sheinbaum has focused her security strategy on four key points: prevent young people from joining the ranks of criminals by putting them in the workplace or a classroom; strengthen the Mexican federal troops, including a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/americas/mexico-national-guard-military-control.html" title="">130,000-strong National Guard</a>, and the local and state police forces to avoid any collusion with organized crime groups; focus on intelligence and investigations that lead to high-profile arrests; and enhance coordination among the federal and state authorities, including prosecutor’s offices.</p><p>“When I am asked if the strategy is going to work, I am convinced that it will,” Ms. Sheinbaum said during the Tuesday meeting.</p><p>The next day, gunmen shot and killed a senior judge as he stepped outside a court building in Acapulco.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emiliano-rodriguez-mega">More about Emiliano Rodríguez Mega</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
