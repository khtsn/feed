Their case comes after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/california-trump-tariffs-lawsuit-newsom-bonta.html" title="">California filed its own lawsuit last week</a>, in which Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state attorney general accused the administration of escalating a trade war that has caused “immediate and irreparable harm” to that state’s economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Officials and businesses from Oregon, the lead plaintiff in the suit filed Wednesday, have also <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/04/23/oregon-ag-sues-the-trump-administration-over-tariffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed concerns</a> about the vulnerability of the state’s trade-dependent economy, as well as its <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2025/04/tariff-tantrum-squeezes-oregons-sneaker-business.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sportswear industry</a>, as a result of the tariffs.</p><p>“When a president pushes an unlawful policy that drives up prices at the grocery store and spikes utility bills, we don’t have the luxury of standing by,” said Dan Rayfield, Oregon’s attorney general, in a statement. “These tariffs hit every corner of our lives — from the checkout line to the doctor’s office — and we have a responsibility to push back.”</p><p>Asked about the latest lawsuit, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, called it a “witch hunt” by Democrats against Mr. Trump. </p><p>“The Trump administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing,” he said, “both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.”</p><p>The other states in the suit are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Vermont. All of the states have Democratic attorneys general, though Nevada and Vermont have Republican governors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s tariffs have shocked and upended the global trade industry. He set a 145 percent tariff on goods from China, 25 percent on Canada, and 10 percent on almost all imports from most other countries.</p><p>The moves have drawn legal challenges from other entities as well, including two members of the Blackfeet Nation, who <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2025/04/07/blackfeet-tribal-members-sue-feds-over-canada-tariffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a federal lawsuit</a> in Montana over the tariffs on Canada, saying they<a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2025/04/13/blackfeet-indians-file-lawsuit-challenging-trumps-canada-tariffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> violated tribal treaty rights</a>. Legal groups like the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/us-businesses-sue-block-trump-tariffs-say-trade-deficits-are-not-emerg-rcna201213" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Liberty Justice Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/economy/lawsuit-tariffs-china-trump-administration.html" title="">New Civil Liberties Alliance</a> have also sued. </p><p>“I’m happy that Oregon and the other states are joining us in this fight,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, who is working on the Liberty Justice Center’s lawsuit.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David W.
