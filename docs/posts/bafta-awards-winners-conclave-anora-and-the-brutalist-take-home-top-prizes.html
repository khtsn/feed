It took home four awards on Sunday at Britain’s equivalent of the Oscars, commonly known as the BAFTAs. The other three prizes were in minor categories: best editing, best adapted screenplay and outstanding British film.</p><p>In securing the best film award, “Conclave” beat Sean Baker’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/movies/anora-review.html" title="">Anora</a>,” a dramedy in which an exotic dancer marries the son of a Russian oligarch, and Brady Corbet’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/movies/the-brutalist-review.html" title="">The Brutalist</a>,” about a Jewish architect (Adrien Brody) rebuilding his life in the United States after the Holocaust.</p><p>It also triumphed over the Bob Dylan biopic “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/movies/a-complete-unknown-review.html" title="">A Complete Unknown</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/movies/emilia-perez-review.html" title="">Emilia Pérez</a>.”</p><p>“Conclave” hadn’t previously featured among the major winners this awards season. It only secured one Golden Globe, for best screenplay, at a ceremony in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/05/arts/golden-globes#golden-globes-brutalist-emilia-perez" title="">“Emilia Pérez” and “The Brutalist” were the big winners</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/movies/oscars-race-emilia-perez-anora.html" title="">the momentum for the best picture Oscar</a> had swung to “Anora,” after that movie picked up major honors at this year’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/movies/critics-choice-awards-winners-complete-list.html" title="">Critic’s Choice</a> ceremony and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/movies/anora-wins-producers-and-directors-guild-awards.html?timespastHighlight=Directors,Guild,of,America?timespastHighlight=Directors,Guild,of,America" title="">Directors Guild of America</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/movies/anora-wins-producers-and-directors-guild-awards.html?timespastHighlight=Directors,Guild,of,America?timespastHighlight=Directors,Guild,of,America" title="">Producers Guild of America</a> awards.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yet the prominence of “Conclave” at the BAFTAs will give the movie momentum going into this year’s Academy Awards, scheduled for March 2. There is significant overlap between the voting bodies for both awards, and the BAFTAs and Oscars regularly have the same winners.</p><p>The cast and crew of “Conclave” looked stunned when the best film prize was announced. Isabella Rossellini, who plays a nun in the movie, stood onstage smiling gleefully throughout Berger’s acceptance speech, in which he said he was “deeply humbled” to see his film receive the honor.</p><p>In the best director category, Corbet was the victor for “The Brutalist,” winning out over Berger, Baker (“Anora”), Jacques Audiard (“Emilia Pérez”), Denis Villeneuve (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/movies/dune-part-two-review.html" title="">Dune: Part Two</a>”) and Coralie Fargeat (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/movies/the-substance-review.html" title="">The Substance,</a>” a body-horror gross-out about a washed-up TV star, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/movies/demi-moore-substance-oscars.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">played by Demi Moore</a>).</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adrien Brody, center, in a scene from “The Brutalist.” Brody won the BAFTA award for best actor on Sunday, and the filmmaker Brady Corbet won best director for the film.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lol Crawley/A24, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The Brutalist” had a strong night, taking home four awards — the same as “Conclave” — with Brody winning the prize for best leading actor. In that category, he beat Fiennes (“Conclave”), Colman Domingo (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/movies/sing-sing-review.html" title="">Sing Sing</a>”), Hugh Grant (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/movies/heretic-review-hugh-grant.html" title="">Heretic</a>”), Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”) and Sebastian Stan (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/movies/the-apprentice-review-donald-trump-roy-cohn.html" title="">The Apprentice</a>”).</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the leading actress category, Mikey Madison won for her role in “Anora,” besting Moore, as well as Cynthia Erivo (“Wicked”), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/movies/marianne-jean-baptiste-mike-leigh-oscars.html" title="">Marianne Jean-Baptiste</a> (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/movies/hard-truths-review-mike-leigh.html" title="">Hard Truths</a>”) and Saoirse Ronan (“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/movies/the-outrun-review.html" title="">The Outrun</a>”).</p><p>In her acceptance speech, Madison asked for a moment “to recognize the sex worker community,” adding: “I see you.

Zoe Saldaña also name-checked Gascón, among others, when she accepted the best supporting actress award. The best supporting actor prize went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
