That authority has never before been challenged in this way, and critics say the maneuver is illegal. But it would be much faster than trying to overturn the California ban through the standard process that requires months of public notice and comment.</p><p>Until last month, the United States <a href="https://rhg.com/research/trump-2-0-whats-in-store-for-us-energy-and-climate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was expected to record significant reductions</a> in its greenhouse-gas emissions over the next decade.
