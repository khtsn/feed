Every corner of the world is now experiencing the effects of these rising temperatures in the form of deadlier hurricanes, floods, wildfires and droughts, as well as species extinction.</p><p>To achieve such a wholesale overhaul of the country’s climate policies in such a short time, the Trump administration has reneged on federal grants, fired workers en masse and attacked longstanding environmental regulations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>All new presidents have their own agendas, but the speed and scale of Mr. Trump’s efforts to uproot climate policy is unprecedented. “This is not the kind of stately tennis match of the usual switch-over in administrations,” said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, an environmental law firm. “This is full on Fight Club.”</p><p>The Trump administration’s moves have unfolded simultaneously across the sprawling government, affecting federal, state and local agencies and hitting government-funded projects in Africa, Antarctica and around the world. On Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump withdrew the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" title="">from the Paris climate agreement, making it the only nation to walk away</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump has frozen funds appropriated by Congress for clean energy projects, taking particular aim at wind energy, the country’s largest source of renewable power. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/climate/wind-power-executive-order-trump.html" title="">has stopped approvals</a> for wind farms on public land and in federal waters and has threatened to block projects on private land.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/28/multimedia/00cli-demolish-04-cjzm/00cli-demolish-04-cjzm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/28/multimedia/00cli-demolish-04-cjzm/00cli-demolish-04-cjzm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/28/multimedia/00cli-demolish-04-cjzm/00cli-demolish-04-cjzm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three giant wind turbines rise from the blue ocean, each with three long blades, and a ship is visible in the distance.

At the same time, Mr. Trump has declared <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/business/trump-energy-emergency-inflation.html" title="">an energy emergency</a>, giving himself the authority to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/climate/army-corps-engineers-fossil-fuel-permits.html" title="">fast-track the construction of oil and gas projects</a> as he works to stoke supply as well as demand for fossil fuels.</p><p>“We’re going to drill, baby, drill and do all of the things that we wanted to,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-emergency-oil-gas.html" title="">Mr. Trump said</a> just hours after being sworn in for his second term.</p><p>The United States is producing more oil than any other nation in history, and is also the world’s biggest exporter of natural gas. The fossil fuel industry donated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/climate/oil-gas-donations-trump.html" title="">more than $75 million</a> to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and Mr. Trump, in turn, promised to weaken environmental regulations in ways that would lower its costs and increase its margins.</p><p>The president has repeatedly mocked climate change, criticized regulations and said that more drilling would bring down energy bills.</p><p>In several cases, the administration’s actions have flouted the law, with agencies defying court orders, freezing funds in legally binding contracts and reinterpreting regulations to suit their aims. In doing so, Mr. Trump has busted through many of the barriers that were erected by the officials during the Biden administration who believed that process and the legal system would slow or deter him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The administration and Republicans in Congress plan to use a legislative maneuver <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/climate/republicans-california-waiver-electric-cars.html" title="">to quickly erase</a> California’s authority to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars in the state by 2035. That authority has never before been challenged in this way, and critics say the maneuver is illegal. But it would be much faster than trying to overturn the California ban through the standard process that requires months of public notice and comment.</p><p>Until last month, the United States <a href="https://rhg.com/research/trump-2-0-whats-in-store-for-us-energy-and-climate/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was expected to record significant reductions</a> in its greenhouse-gas emissions over the next decade. But the Trump administration’s changes pave the way for more planet-warming pollution and will likely slow the advance of cleaner technologies like wind and solar energy.</p><p>“To power the Great American comeback, President Trump is unleashing American energy and eliminating the Green New Scam,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson. “The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency are working in tandem to implement President Trump’s Day 1 executive action and undo Biden’s radical climate policies that restrained America’s economy and abundant natural resources.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cleanup crews contracting with the E.P.A. in a neighborhood of Altadena, Calif., destroyed in the Eaton fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Trump’s supporters are delighting in the audacity and scale of his attacks on climate and environmental regulations.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“They’re doing all the things I thought they would do, and they’re doing other things that I only dreamed they might do,” said Myron Ebell, a conservative activist who led the E.P.A. transition team during Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>Many of Mr. Trump’s moves may have a lasting effect on the country’s ability to confront climate change.</p><p>Thousands of federal jobs that are eliminated now may be hard to restore. Clean energy projects that were relying on federal funding may not proceed without the expected investments. A sudden stop to scientific work could create gaps in data collection that are impossible to fill.

Some funds have begun moving, but many remain stalled.</p><p>John Podesta, a senior climate adviser in the Biden administration, called many of the Trump administration actions illegal. “We followed the law, and they’re breaking the law,” Mr. Podesta said. “It remains to be seen whether they’ll be allowed to get away with it.”</p><p>In the past few weeks Mr. Trump has fired thousands of employees at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, the Department of Energy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/climate/noaa-layoffs-trump.html" title="">and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, the government’s premiere climate science agency.

That would eliminate the legal basis for the government’s climate laws, such as limits on pollution from automobiles and power plants.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“We’re talking about undoing 50 years of environmental regulation and accelerating the extinction crisis and risking the health of the American people,” said Ben Jealous, the executive director of the Sierra Club. “There’s so much shocking news every day.
