    <h1>Trump Picks Chad Chronister, a Florida Sheriff, as D.E.A. Administrator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Sheriff Chronister will play a central role in addressing the escalating tensions surrounding fentanyl being brought into the United States.</p><p>In response to the announcement, Sheriff Chronister posted on social media, “It is the honor of a lifetime to be nominated” for the position by Mr. Trump. He added, “I am deeply humbled by this opportunity to serve our nation.”</p><p>The D.E.A., an arm of the Justice Department, said in its fiscal year 2025 budget request that 2023 was the highest year for fentanyl seizures since the agency’s inception more than half a century ago. In addition, the agency confiscated more than 77 million fentanyl pills and nearly 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. The agency has more than 10,000 employees, with offices in the U.S. and in more than 60 different countries. It has a budget of more than $3 billion.</p><p>For comparison, Sheriff Chronister’s department in Florida, one of the largest sheriff’s offices in the state, has a 2024 budget of about $600 million and oversees more than 3,500 employees.</p><p>Sheriff Chronister’s father-in-law, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/politics/trump-pardon-blagojevich-debartolo.html" title="">received a pardon from Mr. Trump</a> in 2021. Mr. DeBartolo, a former owner of the N.F.L.’s San Francisco 49ers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/politics/trump-pardon-blagojevich-debartolo.html" title="">pleaded guilty in 1998</a> to concealing an extortion plot. Though he avoided prison, he was fined $1 million and was suspended for a year by the N.F.L.</p></div></div>
