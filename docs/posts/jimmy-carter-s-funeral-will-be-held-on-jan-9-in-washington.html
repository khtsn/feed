Mr. Carter will be brought to Atlanta by motorcade and lie in repose on Saturday and Sunday at the Carter Center, which was the home of his post-presidential humanitarian work.</p><p>Mr. Carter, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-dead.html" title="">died at his home in Plains, Ga., at 100 on Sunday</a>, will then be flown on Monday, Jan. 6, to Washington. He will lie in state at the Capitol, as several presidents going back to Abraham Lincoln have. Thousands of people are expected to file through the Rotunda to pay their respects, including lawmakers, diplomats and everyday Americans.</p><p>The service at the cathedral, which traditionally hosts state funerals for presidents as well as other major American figures, will be the highlight of the remembrances. Other former presidents are expected to attend, but it was not clear whether President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has regularly denigrated Mr. Carter, would be invited or attend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In addition to Mr. Biden, Jason Carter, the former president’s grandson and chairman of the board of the Carter Center, will speak at the cathedral. Eulogies will also be read from two people who were close to Mr. Carter but who have already died: former President Gerald R. Ford, the Republican who was defeated by Mr. Carter in 1976 but went on to become a friend, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/us/politics/mondale-carter-eulogy.html" title="">former Vice President Walter F. Mondale</a>, Mr. Carter’s running mate and partner. Mr. Ford <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html" title="">died in 2006</a> and Mr. Mondale <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/us/politics/walter-mondale-dead.html" title="">in 2021</a>. The eulogies are set to be read by their sons, Steven Ford and Ted Mondale.</p><p>After the cathedral service, Mr. Carter will be brought back to Georgia for burial. Initial plans once called for him to be transported by train, but Mr. Carter objected. “If you take my cold, dead body across the U.S. by train, I’ll haunt you until the day you die,” he told a staff member. So instead, he will return to Georgia on a military flight.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
