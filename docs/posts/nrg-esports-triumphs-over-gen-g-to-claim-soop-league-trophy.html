</span> 3-0 in the grand final of the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2225/soop-valorant-league/playoffs" target="_blank">SOOP Valorant League</a>, earning the right to lift the trophy in one of the biggest events of the offseason. </p>

<p>The three-map series played out on Abyss, Haven, and Ascent, Abyss and Ascent being Gen.G&#39;s picks and Haven being NRG&#39;s pick. NRG won Abyss 13-4, Haven 13-11, and Ascent 13-4.</p>

<p>Both teams came into this match with a point to prove. For NRG, it was a chance to turn over a new leaf for an experienced core after a disappointing 2024 season with the addition of two highly anticipated rookies. For Gen.G, it was a chance to show that changing two players hadn&#39;t taken away from their ability to vie for championships. </p>

<p>The series kicked off on Gen.G&#39;s first map pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425355/nrg-esports-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-gf/?game=194172&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>. Both sides brought out distinct compositions that they had shown earlier in the event, with Gen.G locking in Astra and Omen and NRG opting for Harbor and Vyse. The first six rounds were back-and-forth, leading to a 3-3 start, but NRG tore away with a 9-3 lead as Gen.G became increasingly unable to handle the opposition&#39;s rapid site hits, ironclad postplants, and deep mid searches. </p>

<p>In the second half, NRG demonstrated a superior defense with impressive and varied Vyse setups from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/817/finesse">
		FiNESSE	</a>
</span>, easily closing out Abyss 13-4. Statistically, it was <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/21668/verno">
		Verno	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/4164/s0m">
		s0m	</a>
</span> who controlled the server; the former found 17 kills to 6 deaths and a 1.66 rating while the latter scored 18 kills to 9 deaths and a 1.49 rating. </p>

<p>NRG opened their map pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425355/nrg-esports-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-gf/?game=194173&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a> with a similarly dominant attack half, building an 8-4 lead despite losing the first pistol. In contrast, the second half was neck-and-neck as both teams struggled to string together multiple rounds in a row until the score was 12-8 in NRG&#39;s favor. Gen.G rallied temporarily, managing to get to 11 rounds, but NRG denied overtime and won out Haven 13-11. </p>

<p>While <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/2489/munchkin">
		Munchkin	</a>
</span> led his team with 19 kills and a 1.13 rating, it was Verno once again lighting up the scoreboard with 21 kills to only 11 deaths and a 1.67 rating. The American Initiator racked up highlights on the map, including a 1v2 in round 11 and a belting 4K with the Guardian in round 15. </p>

<p>The final map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/425355/nrg-esports-vs-gen-g-soop-valorant-league-gf/?game=194174&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a>. This time, NRG established an even greater lead early on, converting the first pistol on their defense and then the bonus off the back of a Judge 3K from s0m. An ace from s0m in round 7 later led his team to a 6-1 lead. Every setup that NRG used seemed to work perfectly to foil Gen.G&#39;s plans as they consistently won out their duels, culminating in a 10-2 half. NRG took home Ascent 13-4 to complete the clean sweep over Gen.G and win the SOOP League.</p>

<p>“I think we just had a really good flow in all three maps, we had a good game plan going into the game,” FiNESSE commented on the win in the post-match interview. </p>

<p>“I think it showed that we&#39;re pretty good, so hopefully a lot of winning next season,” <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/11225/ethan">
		Ethan	</a>
</span> added when asked what fans could expect from the team going into 2025. </p>

<p>With this win, NRG has cemented themselves as a title contender going into the 2025 season, which is now just one month away. NRG will next return for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2274/champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff" target="_blank">Americas Kickoff</a>, which begins Jan. 16.</p>
