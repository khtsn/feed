    <h1>Oppenheimer’s Communist Past Draws New Attention</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>J. Robert Oppenheimer teemed with contradictions. He was shy and bold, naïve and brilliant, a loyal husband who cheated, a gentle man whose bomb could kill millions.</p><p>That he loved quantum physics may be no accident. The field holds that some basic phenomena of the material world <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/books/review/adam-becker-what-is-real.html" title="">have opposing features that cannot be observed simultaneously</a>, such as wave and particle behavior. Oppenheimer had a deep affection for these irreconcilable pairs. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23737540" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He called them</a> “the nature of the surprise, of the miracle, of something that you could not figure out.”</p><p>In a universe of contradictions, the physicist himself grew famous as an American hero and infamous as a red sympathizer. The question of his true loyalties rang alarms 80 years ago as the Federal Bureau of Investigation probed Oppenheimer’s Communist past — and is now — surprisingly — gaining new attention.</p><p>This fall, months after Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/10/movies/oscars-academy-awards" title="">won seven Oscars</a>, the Journal of Cold War Studies, a quarterly publication of Harvard University, is revisiting the Oppenheimer case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Four historians argue that the physicist was not just a Communist ally but a full-blown member of a secret Berkeley unit who ultimately perjured himself in a federal hearing that had dug into his past. As evidence, they cite a substantial body of letters, memoirs and espionage files, some postdating the movie’s source material.</p><p>“Historians have to go where the evidence takes them,” said Gregg Herken, who leads the reassessment and is emeritus professor of history at the University of California.</p><p>In sharp disagreement is <a href="https://kaibird.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kai Bird</a>, co-author of “American Prometheus,” the 2005 biography of Oppenheimer on which Mr. Nolan based his film. The biographer denied that, in the 18 years since his book’s publication, any evidence has come to light confirming that the superstar of American science was in fact a true Communist.</p><p>“The only reason these folks are revisiting this issue is because of the Nolan film,” Mr. Bird said. “They’re pushing their own little crusade.”</p><p>A middle path also exists. Some scholars, not unlike the quantum physicists, see both claims about Oppenheimer as possibly true — that he was and wasn’t a dedicated Communist. Potential clues, they say, can be found in his tangled life.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“He may have wavered,” said <a href="https://sakmyster.wordpress.com/about/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thomas L. Sakmyster</a>, an expert on underground Communist units. He said that flexible rules let members see their red ties as blurry.</p><p>Oppenheimer and others, Dr. Sakmyster said, “may have thought of themselves as fellow travelers” — that is, sympathetic to Communism but not formal party members. “Probably quite a few vacillated in this in-between state.” In the idiom of the day, they were pink individuals in red groups.</p><p>Oppenheimer’s love of contradictory pairs grew into a philosophical stance. He borrowed it from his mentor Niels Bohr, also a quantum physicist. Bohr called it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1933/06/23/archives/jekyllhyde-mind-attributed-to-man-complementarity-new-theory-of.html" title="">complementarity</a>. He saw the opposites of quantum physics as a model for how the threat of atomic annihilation might hold the seeds of its own abolition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/science/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/science/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/science/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A low angle looking up at four scientists in suits having a discussion, led by Robert Oppenheimer, who gestures with his left hand while he holds a piece of paper and a pipe in his right." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/science/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/science/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/science/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1018w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/08/science/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr/00sci-oppenheimer-bohr-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2036w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="604"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Oppenheimer, left, in Geneva, Switzerland, with his mentor, the physicist Niels Bohr, right, in 1960.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stampfli/RDB/ullstein bild, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>So did Oppenheimer.

His family’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jfSn2RJZI9EC&amp;q=%E2%80%9Ca+remarkable+collection%E2%80%9D#v=snippet&amp;q=%E2%80%9Ca%20remarkable%20collection%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">art collection included works</a> by Picasso, Van Gogh and Cezanne. Oppenheimer graduated from Harvard in three years. After studying in Europe with top scientists, he taught physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Erudite and charismatic, he had an otherworldly air that many of his students emulated.</p><p>Amid the social upheavals of the Great Depression, Oppenheimer, like many 1930s liberals, belonged to leftist groups that denounced fascism abroad and sought economic justice at home. Even so, the elite physicist had little in common with the “card carrying, dues paying” Communists of his day. The workers joined picket lines, went to rallies and sold <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1958/01/10/archives/end-of-the-daily-worker.html" title="">newspapers that reliably echoed Moscow’s line</a>.</p><p>The ranks of the party soon expanded, however. In the 1930s, it began to court doctors, lawyers, professors, filmmakers and other members of the middle and upper classes. Many were leery of party affiliation. In response, the American party encouraged them to join underground units where members could study Marx, adopt pseudonyms and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N6sEAQAAIAAJ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">work in secret</a> to aid the party. They carried no cards, unlike their worker comrades.</p><p>“It was risky and thrilling,” said Dr. Sakmyster, a emeritus professor of history at the University of Cincinnati. The secret members, he added, tended to be “very idealistic, very romantic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>This was the moment in which Oppenheimer embraced Communism. His wife, his former fiancée, his brother, his sister-in-law and some of his best friends were party members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/inmatterofjrober0000usat/mode/2up?q=%22fellow+traveler%22" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He called himself “a fellow traveler</a>.” He subscribed <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0AFRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CI+was+never+a+member+of+the+party,+concealed+or+open%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjI1aaj7ueFAxXTEFkFHZ1YAJEQ6AF6BAgHEAI#v=snippet&amp;q=%E2%80%9CI%20subscribed%20to%20the%20People&#39;s%20World%22%20&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to People’s World</a>, a Communist newspaper, and each year gave the party up to roughly $1,000 — today the equivalent of more than $20,000.</p><p>That might have raised eyebrows in some circles, but it was not illegal. And Moscow would soon be Washington’s ally in World War II. After the war, however, Moscow got the bomb and quickly built a threatening arsenal.

Dr. Kramer said that Mr. Bird, the biographer, had declined an invitation to address their comments and that Mr. Nolan did not respond.</p><p>To a reporter, Mr. Bird scorned the historians as petty. Moreover, in an exchange of emails, he disparaged the spy reports cited by Dr. Haynes and Dr. Klehr as “marshmallow evidence.”</p><p>The real story, Mr. Bird said, is that Oppenheimer’s charisma inspired wide feelings of personal loyalty and even devotion.

To ease the way, they would relax the secret admission rules.</p><p>Party officials, Dr. McMillan said, “wanted so much to have some kind of connection to a person of his prominence that they would let you write your own ticket.” That freedom, she added, may also have given Oppenheimer “a way he could think he was not a member.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Dr. Sakmyster, who studied the secret units for his 2011 book, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DZJrQThbfv8C" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Red Conspirator</a>,” gave an example of that kind of accommodation. He said members of the underground groups could forgo regular dues — a duty for the rank and file. Secret members, he said, were given the option to make large donations, preferably in cash because it was difficult to trace.</p><p>Dr. Sakmyster added that the renunciation of cards and regular dues raised basic questions for him on whether the secret unit members were true Communists. In researching his book, he said he had found many cases where members saw themselves as pink rather than red. “It’s a difficulty,” Dr. Sakmyster said, in determining what defined a Communist back then.</p><p>Significantly, Dr. Griffiths, who told of being the liaison to Oppenheimer’s secret unit and described his job as handing out party literature and collecting dues, pointed in his memoir to that kind of muddle.</p><p>“I was given to understand that Oppenheimer, as a man of independent wealth, made his contribution through some special channel,” <a href="https://www.brotherhoodofthebomb.com/bhbsource/new_evidence_3.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Griffiths wrote</a>. “Nobody carried a party card.

Why?</p><p>In the new edition <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brotherhood-Bomb-Loyalties-Oppenheimer-Lawrence-ebook/dp/B00E70ZXS8/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of his book</a>, which came out months after the movie, Dr. Herken argues that Oppenheimer went silent because he “desperately wanted” to hide his red past. Admitting the truth at his 1954 trial, he said, would have contradicted his previous denials and made him vulnerable to a perjury charge. Under federal law, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">perjury can lead to</a> up to five years in prison.</p><p>“The possibility that his secret party membership would come to light,” Dr. Herken wrote, “haunted him the rest of his days.”</p><p>Mr. Bird in “American Prometheus” argued that Oppenheimer had nothing to hide and was silenced by the country’s arms complex. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jfSn2RJZI9EC&amp;q=%22Like+that+rebellious+Greek+god%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Like%20that%20rebellious%20Greek%20god%22&amp;f=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The book likened him</a> to the Greek god who stole fire from the pantheon, gave it to humans and suffered eternal punishment for his crime.</p><p>Dr. Wellerstein, the historian of science, suggested that a jumble of factors and contradictions likely undid Oppenheimer, not just one or two.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>What prompted his silencing, Dr. Wellerstein said, was probably not so much the fear of incarceration as the shattering of his former life. The historian described Oppenheimer’s loss of both his security clearance and his access to the corridors of power as “psychologically crippling. It broke him. He no longer had any desire to get involved with anything. He became bitter.”</p><p>Oppenheimer, if alive today, might enjoy how the experts contradict one another on what contributed to his unraveling. After all, he loved the scientific inconsistencies.</p><p>In the end, however, his own temperament and set of ambiguities did him in, turning the hero into a sullen recluse.</p><p>“He could have become a grand old man of physics,” Dr. Wellerstein said. “Instead, he became this increasingly depressed figure, drinking himself into oblivion.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At his desk at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., in 1964.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettman/Getty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William J.
