While previous hurricanes — most recently Helene — have caused power losses and damage, none has directly struck Sarasota since 1946, according to a New York Times analysis of hurricane information from <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/hurr.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database</a>.

This time, she and others feared that Sarasota would not be so lucky.</p><p>Ms. Borysek was staying with a friend just a few blocks away. The area was under a mandatory evacuation order, but she said that her friend’s 17-story building on Main Street felt safe, adding that other friends also planned to ride out Milton in downtown high-rises.</p><p>One of the people staying in the same building was Dale Parks, an architect who has lived in Sarasota for 40 years (and designed the local bus station). Standing outside on Wednesday morning, Mr. Parks looked at the deserted downtown streets, with businesses boarded up and sandbagged, and said he was nervous. Not about the building — “it’s concrete and high-impact glass,” he said — but about the storm’s aftermath.</p><p>“Sarasota is going to be so torn up,” he said. “It’s the first time I’ve seen a storm do this. That’s what’s making me nervous.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Luke Kehrer, 18, and his father, Alan Kehrer, 56, taking what the younger man said were “last looks” at Sarasota Bay on Wednesday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zack Wittman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Back at Bayfront Park, Alan Kehrer, 56, and his son, Luke Kehrer, 18, stood quietly staring over the slate-gray bay, getting what the younger man said were “last looks.”</p><p>“It’s sentimental,” said his father, who recalled his houseboat being tossed by storm surge in 1985 during Hurricane Elena, which did not come ashore in Florida.</p><p>The Kehrers saw Milton’s forecast path on Tuesday night and thought that Sarasota would be spared. But Wednesday morning’s forecast suggested the possibility of a far greater risk to the city.</p><p>The Kehrers live inland, outside of the evacuation zone. But their street flooded in August during Hurricane Debby, which made landfall hundreds of miles north in Florida.</p><p>“I’m going to try to get some sleep today,” the elder Mr. Kehrer said, anticipating that he would “stay up all night tonight, worrying.”</p><p>Annie Correal<!-- --> and <!-- -->Bea Malsky<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patricia Mazzei is the lead reporter for The Times in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Hurricane Milton</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Florida on High Alert:</strong> Hurricane Milton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/hurricane-milton-florida-high-alert.html">threatened nearly the entire state</a> as it blew in from the Gulf of Mexico, yet another case of a menacing storm putting many of Florida’s 23 million residents in danger.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some Inmates Will Not Evacuate:</strong> Manatee County, just south of Tampa, has ordered residents in three evacuation zones to get out. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/weather/florida-milton-evacuations-jail.html">But the inmates and staff of the county jail will stay put</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can Electric Vehicles Catch Fire in Hurricanes?:</strong> E.V. batteries that are submerged in saltwater can catch fire after the floods subside, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/climate/electric-vehicles-fire-hurricanes.html">experts say it’s a rarity</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>FEMA’s Severe Staffing Shortage:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/climate/hurricane-milton-fema-staff-shortage.html">Fewer than 10% of the agency’s disaster workers</a> are available to respond to Hurricane Milton and other calamities.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
