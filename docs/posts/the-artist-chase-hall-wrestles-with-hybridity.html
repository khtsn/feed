Having grown up with a mother in and out of rehab and a father in and out of jail; attended eight schools before the age of 16; and achieved an enviable degree of fame for an untrained 31-year-old artist, Hall has a lot to say.</p><p>He is generally expressing himself through his paintings, several of which will be on view in his solo show at David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles, which opens Nov. 8 and runs through Dec. 14.</p><p>But in a recent lengthy conversation at his studio in upstate New York, Hall also posed some of the complex questions that clearly — and consistently — consume him.</p><p>“How do things that define you, but don’t end you, actually make you better instead of paralyze you?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“What does rap music teach you? What do Blaxploitation films teach you? What do you see when you live in low income? And then what do you see when you’re in high income?”</p><p>“Who’s talking about what it’s like to be Black and white at the same time?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An artist works on a mural on the right, with  other paintings on the wall behind him." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/27/multimedia/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb/27sp-finearts-chasehall-02-cjzb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="100vw" uri="nyt://image/e4ee9314-13ff-5bf9-8ae7-d6ed7098a832" decoding="async" width="600" height="407"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hall working on “The Future and The Past (God is Us)” in September.

In 2022, he was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera to produce a large-scale artwork for the opera house — a diptych depicting two scenes from the ancient Greek tragedy of Medea — that was recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p>Last year, he had his first <a href="https://www.scadmoa.org/exhibitions/the-close-of-day" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">solo museum show</a> at the SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>His “Mother and Child (Lauren and Henrietta),” from this year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Kordansky Gallery.

One moment he is referencing the artists Mike Kelley, Robert Rauschenberg and Charles White, the next Stevie Wonder, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. He talks about Helen Frankenthaler, Clyfford Still, Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner. Then he pivots to James Baldwin, Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And then to Trayvon Martin, Philando Castile and George Floyd.</p><p>Hall has also become something of a fashion darling, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/chase-hall/?list=30under30-art-style&amp;sh=7d5ed9ae63f6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">featured</a> in Forbes’s “30 Under 30” 2021 art and style list and having his wedding covered by <a href="https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/lauren-rodriguez-chase-hall-new-york-wedding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vogue</a> in 2022.</p><p>And the people he paints — whether a jazz musician or a Tuskegee Airman — have their own dashing quality and dignity as well as a quiet complexity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some of his works are in the collections of the Whitney, the Walker Art Center and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arden Wray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“There is this theme of leisure that runs throughout his practice,” said the curator and gallerist Antwaun Sargent, who worked on a <a href="https://www.jenkinsjohnsongallery.com/exhibitions/11-then-now-chase-hall-and-cameron-welch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2019 show</a> that featured Hall and the artist Cameron Welch. “But also the underbelly of that.” The artist — tall with a lanky elegance — clearly has not only an upbeat nature but an innate survivor instinct. And he says he has increasingly made peace with his past and with his parents.</p><p>“My mom is three years sober, and my dad is rehabilitating himself,” Hall said. “Through holding people accountable and thinking more deeply, I was able to have these constructive and intense conversations with both my mom and dad over the last five, 10 years that have allowed us to all start healing and grieving and thinking about the next chapter of our lives with the baby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It came to a point now where I had to create, lead by example,” he continued. “I didn’t want to keep pointing the fingers like, ‘How could you put me through that crap?’ Or, ‘Where were you?’”</p><p>Born in Saint Paul, Minn., to a white mother and a Black father, Hall said he grew up being called names like “piss-colored” and “yellow boy.”</p><p>Hall initially wanted to be a photojournalist — “think Gordon Parks slash Langston Hughes” — but, after being moved to tears in front of a Henry Taylor painting at MoMA, ultimately realized art was his calling. He did a residency at Skowhegan in Maine. He studied under Catherine Opie at a residency in Florida.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The Future and The Past (God is Us),” made this year by Chase Hall.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Kordansky Gallery.

So it was this beautiful infrastructure for me.</p><p>“Oftentimes we speak about the art world as this kind of cherry on top, but it really wasn’t that for me,” he continued. “It was a substance. It was a lifeline. It was a community.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Hall uses coffee as a pigment and cotton canvas — well aware that coffee and cotton were slave crops. “I use the coffee as a representation of Blackness, and I utilize the cotton as a representation of whiteness,” he said.</p><p>Akili Tommasino. an associate curator at the Met, said Hall “thinks of the material itself as a metaphor for the exploitation of people of African descent through the trans-Atlantic slave trade and generational enslavement,” calling the Met’s recent acquisition “one of Chase’s most developed works in terms of featuring the range of conceptual and aesthetic innovations that he’s been working on.”</p><p>Hall’s first solo gallery show opened at the Monique Meloche Gallery in Chicago in 2020, followed by one at the Clearing gallery in Brooklyn in 2021 and at Eva Presenhuber in Zurich in 2022.</p><p>He recently moved his home and studio to a remote part of upstate New York in part to get some distance from the frenzy of the art world and to establish an oasis of his own. Hall always yearned for that country house ideal, he said — “throw the ball with your brothers and sisters, run around with the dog, go fishing. These leisure moments or opportunities to relax and exist and be together.”</p><p>The artist said he now tried to take those contemplative moments with his new family, though this had been a radical adjustment from his former life of working day and night and going to gallery openings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>But despite his current more tranquil and bucolic existence, Hall clearly continues to grapple with the thorny issues of identity raised by his mixed race, using terms like “hybridity,” “duality.” and “palindromic.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hall stood near his studio in West Park, N.Y.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arden Wray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“You’re still marginalized because you’re not 100 percent white, and you’re still vilified — and not getting the complete love of what it would be to be completely Black, without a colonial genetic history,” he said. “I am emboldening that confusion instead of running from it.”</p><p>“Just as much as I am Black, I am white,” Hall continued. “Until we tackle that mixedness that’s only becoming more common around the world, we will always stay in the vacuums of these identities and races.”</p><p>To be sure, Hall realizes that he will never be completely free of his troubled history (he said his uncle was killed by police and his aunt was murdered in a drug deal gone wrong). But he has tried to learn from it rather than repeat it. “Between my mom and dad, I had a lot of great examples of what not to do,” he said.</p><p>The artist has also developed an inner resilience that has enabled him to persevere and succeed. And, after so many years of having to fudge the facts about what his parents did, he said he’s grown committed to truth-telling.</p><p>“How do I flip myself inside out and still stand tall and look you in the eyes and keep my chin up?” he said. “That’s what my work is. It’s not easy. It’s damaging, it’s burning a candle at both ends and it’s the rage and the grin-and-bear-it that many of us deal with.”</p><p>So while some young artists might struggle in the glare of art world fame, Hall said that pressure was a “piece of cake,” given that he’s sat in front of district attorneys watching his mother cry in handcuffs. “What is it like to be in the art world?” he said. “It’s nothing compared to the real world.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 22, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an artist.
