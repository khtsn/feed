David Chiu, the city’s attorney, filed a lawsuit against the Port of Oakland on April 18 to protect the trademark title “San Francisco International Airport.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Port officially renamed the airport, which had been called Metropolitan Oakland International, after a unanimous vote of the Oakland Board of Port Commissioners, according to <a href="https://www.portofoakland.com/san-francisco-bay-oakland-international-airport-name-official-unanimous-final-vote-by-oakland-board-of-port-commissioners/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a news release issued by the port</a>.</p><p>Magistrate Judge Thomas S. Hixson of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California decided on Tuesday to temporarily block the Port of Oakland from calling itself the new name because the Port had taken San Francisco’s trademark name and “applied it to a smaller, less successful, and lower rated airport,” according to court documents. He added that the new name “strongly implies affiliation with San Francisco and the San Francisco International Airport.”</p><p>Now, the Oakland airport will have to remove its signage, change <a href="https://www.iflyoak.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its website</a> and update its social media accounts, which still displayed the San Francisco Bay name as of Wednesday.</p><p>“For months, we have tried reasoning with Oakland officials to avoid litigation and come up with alternative names that would work for all of us,” Mr. Chiu said in a statement on Tuesday. “Unfortunately, those efforts were not productive, and we had no choice but to ask the court to step in and protect our trademark.”</p><p>The Port of Oakland said in an emailed statement that its airport is not associated with San Francisco, but it is “a convenient and centrally located option for travelers throughout the Bay Area.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Port also said that it is “currently working to identify and implement the steps needed to comply with the Court’s order,” adding that it is also “continuing to consider its available options in response to the Court’s order.”</p><p>Scott Keyes, founder of Going, a travel app, said that even as both airports in Oakland and San Francisco are at an almost equal distance to downtown San Francisco, “many travelers have no idea and never consider flights to OAK,” the airport in Oakland.</p><p>“Blocking the name change may benefit SFO,” the airport in San Francisco, “but it won’t benefit lovers of cheap flights,” he said.</p><p>The judge’s decision on Tuesday was a preliminary injunction put in place while the case is fully heard.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
