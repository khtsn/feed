The wreckage beneath, mangled and smoldering. The overnight Israeli strike had come without warning, leaving no time to evacuate.</p><p>By morning, search teams were still pulling bodies from the ruins of the residential buildings across from Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the largest public health facility in Lebanon. Locals gathered on Tuesday at the site, just south of Beirut, listening for the ringtones of their loved ones’ phones emanating from under the debris.</p><p>“We’re hearing his phone ringing. It keeps ringing under the rubble,” said Mpsati Mi, 30, an Ethiopian national who was searching for her friend, Aamal.</p><p>“He’s not only a neighbor, but a brother to me,” she said.</p><p>“I tried to call,” said another local resident, Ahmad Kalash, a Syrian national who had already visited nearby hospitals to see if he could find his friend, Hussein.</p><p>“I’m waiting to hear anything from the rescuers,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescue workers retrieve a dead body on Tuesday following a lethal airstrike near the hospital, just south of Beirut.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-2"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents near the hospital on Tuesday after the deadly airstrike.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An injured woman on Tuesday following the strike outside the hospital.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At least 18 people, including four children, were killed in the strike, and 60 others were wounded, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The attack, which was not preceded by an evacuation notice from the Israeli military, also damaged the nearby hospital, which in recent weeks has been swamped by patients <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/lebanon-hospitals-israel-offensive.html" title="">evacuated from other health facilities</a>.</p><p>The Israeli military said that it had not targeted the hospital, and had instead aimed at a “Hezbollah terror target” in the area. The military said that the hospital had not been affected, but damage was seen during a visit to the facility by a Times reporter and photographer on Tuesday.</p><p>The powerful blast had shattered the hospital’s windows and the solar panels affixed atop the building, a lifeline amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/12/world/middleeast/lebanon-blackouts.html" title="">Lebanon’s chronic power shortages</a>. Rows of sand bags now lined the underground parking lot as hospital workers made preparations for further strikes. Many of them were in an uproar, saying they did not have the staff numbers and supplies they needed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-4"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/22/multimedia/22vid-Middle-east-cover-ltvc/22vid-Middle-east-cover-ltvc-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Officials said the attack damaged Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the largest public health facility in Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The hospital was subjected to severe damage,” said Dr. Jihad Saadeh, the hospital’s director, recounting how two missiles had flattened at least three buildings opposite the main gate.</p><p>Israel began an intensified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-lebanon-invasion-map.html" title="">military campaign</a> against Hezbollah last month, nearly a year after the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza.
