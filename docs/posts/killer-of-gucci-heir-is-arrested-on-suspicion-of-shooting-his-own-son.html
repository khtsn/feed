The son was reported not to be in critical condition, but no specifics were given. </p><p>Officials said that they believed that the elder Mr. Ceraulo, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/20/world/milan-journal-the-black-widow-goes-on-trial-in-gucci-slaying.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">shot Maurizio Gucci, the fashion heir, in 1995</a>, was set off on Tuesday by a seemingly small slight: He noticed a scratch on his car, they said, and flew into a fit of rage at his son.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He then grabbed a small caliber pistol and shot his son before trying to kill himself, officials said. The elder Mr. Ceraulo, who is in his 60s, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an illegal weapon.</p><p>The shooting took place almost exactly 30 years after Mr. Ceraulo fired the shots that killed Mr. Gucci — a crime that his ex-wife was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/world/former-wife-given-29-years-for-ordering-gucci-slaying.html" title="">convicted of ordering</a>, and which was depicted in the 2021 film “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/movies/house-of-gucci-review.html?searchResultPosition=61" title="">House of Gucci</a>.” </p><p>Mr. Gucci, who inherited 50 percent of the family business after the death of his father in 1983, had spent his own and the company’s income so quickly that he was forced to sell his shares to a Bahrain-based investment group, Investcorp, 10 years later.</p><p>In March 1995, he was shot <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/world/gunman-kills-gucci-heir-and-escapes.html?searchResultPosition=26" title="">four times</a> outside his office in Milan — twice from behind, and twice in the face at short range — by a gunman with a pistol with a silencer, the police said at the time. He was 45.</p><p>For almost two years, few details emerged about his killing.</p><p>Then, the police arrested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/01/world/italy-detains-ex-wife-in-gucci-s-slaying.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Mr. Gucci’s ex-wife</a>, Patrizia Reggiani, Mr. Ceraulo and others. A court found that Mr. Ceraulo had killed him on Ms. Reggiani’s orders. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Reggiani was convicted and sentenced in 1998 to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/world/former-wife-given-29-years-for-ordering-gucci-slaying.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">29 years in prison</a>.
