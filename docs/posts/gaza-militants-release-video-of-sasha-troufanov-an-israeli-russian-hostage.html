    <h1>Gaza Militants Release Video of Sasha Troufanov, an Israeli Russian Hostage</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>His mother, Lena Troufanov, responded to the video with alarm.</p><p>“I am relieved to see my son alive, but I am very worried to hear what he is saying,” she said in a statement shared by an Israeli hostage families support group. “I urge that every effort be made to secure his immediate release and that of all other hostages. They have no time left.”</p><p>Rights groups and international law experts say that a hostage video is, by definition, made under duress, and that the statements in it are usually coerced. Israeli officials have called the videos of hostages periodically released by Hamas and Islamic Jihad during the war as a form of “psychological warfare,” and experts say their production can constitute a war crime.</p><p>Last month, Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/salam.musafir.3/videos/576759968125158" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Russia Today</a> that Hamas would give “priority” to Mr. Troufanov’s release in any exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, “in honor” of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He said Hamas had spoken to Islamic Jihad about Mr. Troufanov.</p><p>During the Hamas-led attack in October 2023 that set off the war in Gaza, Mr. Troufanov, his mother, his grandmother, and his girlfriend were taken captive and his father was killed. The three women <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/08/14/admin/israel-hostages-released" title="">were released weeks later</a> during a short-lived cease-fire.</p><p>Last week, Sapir Cohen, Mr. Troufanov’s girlfriend, urged President-elect Donald J. Trump to help secure the release of those still held captive in Gaza. “I’m begging you, ensure that rescuing these hostages remains a top priority,” Ms. Cohen said.</p></div></div>
