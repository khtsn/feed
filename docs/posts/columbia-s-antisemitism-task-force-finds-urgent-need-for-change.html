name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A Columbia University task force set up to combat antisemitism on campus released its latest report on Friday, detailing numerous instances of harassment and even physical violence directed at Jewish students in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. The task force found “an urgent need to reshape everyday social norms” at Columbia and recommended changes in how the university prevents and responds to bias incidents.</p><p>Students will return on Tuesday to a campus that was roiled by pro-Palestinian protests in the spring, culminating in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/nyregion/columbia-commencement-cancel-protests.html" title="">canceled commencement ceremony</a> in May. The <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Announcements/Report-2-Task-Force-on-Antisemitism.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">90-page report</a>, based in part on listening sessions with students, follows one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/nyregion/columbia-antisemitism-israel-gaza-protests.html" title="">published in March</a> that called for limits on protests and stronger enforcement of existing rules.</p><p>Since Oct. 7, the task force found, Jewish and Israeli students described being harassed with ethnic slurs and stereotypes, threatened and in some cases assaulted, and some said they were barred from certain student groups because of their Zionism. The task force heard from nearly 500 students, according to the latest report.</p><p>Most of the student experiences detailed in both reports took place before a pro-Palestinian encampment sprung up on campus in April; “at that point, things got worse,” Friday’s report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Students came to share their stories from a variety of religious, geographical, ideological, national, racial, ethnic and political backgrounds,” the report said. “We heard from Zionists, and anti-Zionists, and those whose opinions are not easily categorized.”</p><p>Ester R. Fuchs, a public affairs professor at Columbia and a co-chair of the task force, said that what set this report apart from similar efforts at other universities was its focus on student voices.</p><p>“There has been a view among some that this is not a real problem,” she said, referring to antisemitism on campuses, “so we thought it was important to demonstrate what is actually happening to students.”</p><p>Some students said they had tried to hide their Jewish identities amid campus unrest and avoided walking alone. Others said they had necklaces ripped off their necks and were pushed into walls while walking back to their dorms after synagogue. Students also described being unsure how to report these incidents, and frustrated with what they considered an insufficient response from the university.</p><p>Many students also reported a conflation of Jewish identity with Zionist political ideology, saying that they felt the term “Zionism” was being used to criticize all Jewish people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Audrey Sasson, a Columbia alumna and the executive director of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, which supported the pro-Palestinian protesters, said that while the experiences in the report were painful and real, she was concerned that the report was not “evenhanded” and was intended to stifle dissent.</p><p>“The report certainly lifts up some experiences of certain individuals that are concerning and would be considered antisemitic, which always should be taken seriously,” she said. “But this reactionary approach does not make Jews any safer.”</p><p>The task force had initially declined to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/nyregion/columbia-antisemitism-israel-gaza-protests.html" title="">define antisemitism</a>, with different factions on campus arguing for definitions with different scopes. One would have defined the term as any targeting of Israel, which would have labeled much of the pro-Palestinian campus movement — which includes many Jewish students — as antisemitic. Another would have distinguished between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.</p><p>In the end, the task force put forward a “working definition” of antisemitism as “prejudice, discrimination, hate or violence directed at Jews, including Jewish Israelis,” according to its report. Antisemitism, the report said, can include “targeting Jews or Israelis for violence or celebrating violence against them; exclusion or discrimination based on Jewish identity or ancestry or real or perceived ties to Israel; and certain double standards applied to Israel.”</p><p>The report is the task force’s second but the first to be released under Columbia’s interim president, Katrina A. Armstrong. Ms. Armstrong’s predecessor, Nemat Shafik, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/columbia-president-nemat-shafik-resigns.html" title="">resigned this month</a> amid criticism of her handling of the campus protests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The task force said it had found “serious and pervasive” problems and that the university needed to work harder to promote tolerance of different religions, cultures and national origins. Its report called on the university to improve reporting procedures for complaints and institute anti-bias training for students, faculty members, teaching assistants and student-facing staff.</p><p>In response to complaints about Zionist students being barred from student groups, the report emphasized that groups “must be inclusive, with membership limited only for reasons connected to their mission” and that they should not issue statements unrelated to their missions.</p><p>“This is an opportunity to acknowledge the harm that has been done and to pledge to make the changes necessary to do better,” Dr. Armstrong said in a <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/statement-interim-president-armstrong-second-report-task-force-antisemitism" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Friday, adding that some of the changes were already underway.</p><p>Dr. Armstrong also announced an update to the school&#39;s conduct guidelines, a formal effort to improve campus culture and the creation of an Office of Institutional Equity that would streamline harassment complaints, including those related to antisemitism.</p><p>The task force said it would release a report about bias in classrooms and curriculums in the coming months.</p><p>Sharon Otterman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Fahy reports on New York City and the surrounding area for The Times.
