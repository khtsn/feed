Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate whose standing has dropped in the polls, sought a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss endorsing her in exchange for a promise of a cabinet post, according to two people briefed on the outreach who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p><p>His effort has been unsuccessful. The news was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/14/rfk-jr-kamala-harris-cabinet-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first reported by The Washington Post</a>.</p><p>“We’ve reached out repeatedly through the highest level intermediaries,” Mr. Kennedy wrote in a text message on Wednesday night. “We’ve been told that they have no interest in talking with me.”</p><p>There was little chance the Harris campaign would engage with Mr. Kennedy. Public and private polling has found that as he spent the summer attacking President Biden, he began to draw more support from voters otherwise predisposed to back former President Donald J. Trump. Now Ms. Harris does better in some surveys when Mr. Kennedy is included than when she is tested in a head-to-head matchup with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy, long seen as a potential spoiler in the race, has slipped in polls and struggled to raise money, and he has appeared to consider potential off ramps as speculation has grown about whether he might drop out and, if so, whether he would endorse Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On Wednesday night, Mr. Kennedy wrote: “I’ve always argued that we should be willing to talk with each other across party lines. I’m willing to meet with leaders of both parties to discuss the possibility of a unity government.”</p><p>The Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/rfk-jr-floated-job-trump-white-house-he-weighed-endorsing-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported last month</a> that Mr. Kennedy had held talks with Mr. Trump about a possible cabinet job, proposing a role in public health leadership, in exchange for his support. And in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/rfk-trump-call.html" title="">a leaked video of a phone call</a> between the two men, Mr. Trump tried to cajole Mr. Kennedy to exit the race and endorse him.</p><p>“I would love you to do something,” the former president said. “And I think it’ll be so good for you and so big for you. And we’re going to win.” Mr. Kennedy said little in response on the call. The two men also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/rfk-jr-trump-rnc.html" title="">met in person in Milwaukee</a> during the Republican National Convention. </p><p>Two people familiar with Mr. Kennedy’s campaign confirmed that advisers to Mr. Trump had raised the possibility of a cabinet post with people close to Mr. Kennedy, but said the discussions were fluid and inconclusive. The political circumstances were also far different at the time, when Mr. Biden was still in the race and trailing well behind the former president.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has confronted a range of negative headlines and setbacks in recent weeks.</p></div></div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park.html" title="">This month, he acknowledged</a> he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan in 2014 because he thought it would be “amusing.”</p><p>That bizarre story overshadowed a more serious challenge: a court case in Albany that this week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/nyregion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-new-york-residency.html" title="">removed him from the ballot</a> in New York. A judge said he had used a “sham” address to maintain his New York residency.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rebecca Davis O’Brien covers campaign finance and money in U.S. elections.
