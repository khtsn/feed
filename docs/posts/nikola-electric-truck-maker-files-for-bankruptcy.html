Its share price surged briefly as individual investors and some Wall Street firms clamored to bet on companies that they thought could replicate Tesla’s success and its soaring stock price.</p><p>Investors’ short-lived enthusiasm for Nikola made its founder, Trevor Milton, and other early investors wealthy. But before long, significant doubts emerged about Mr. Milton’s claims about the company’s technology and orders from customers. He was soon ousted, and later convicted on fraud charges.</p><p>In recent quarters, Nikola had begun delivering small numbers of electric trucks but far too few to make money. Late last year, the company said it had $200 million in cash and $270 million in long-term debt. Its stock plunged in early February on reports that the company was nearing a bankruptcy filing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The company <a href="https://www.nikolamotor.com/nikola-initiates-comprehensive-voluntary-chapter-11-sale-process" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a release</a> it had about $47 million in cash on hand, and intended to continue “limited” service and support for trucks out on the road. The bankruptcy filing listed liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion, and put the number of creditors it owes at between 1,000 and 5,000.</p><p>Nikola is one of several fledgling electric vehicle companies that have struggled to turn their ideas into actual cars and trucks.</p><p>Lordstown Motors, which had tried to make pickup trucks in a shuttered General Motors plant in Ohio, sought bankruptcy protection in 2023, and in 2024 was charged with misleading investors by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>A start-up based in Britain called Arrival planned to make electric vans and buses. But it struggled to make its vehicle and manufacturing ideas work and then sold its assets to another start-up, Canoo. That company filed for bankruptcy protection last month.</p><p>A few electric vehicle start-ups are still operating though their share prices have tumbled and it’s not clear how or when they will become profitable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Rivian, which makes electric pickups and sport-utility vehicles, has had trouble ramping up production to the levels it originally aimed for, and its stock now trades at just under $13 a share — a tenth of where it was in late 2021. But the company secured an important lifeline last year when it established a partnership with the German automaker Volkswagen, which has taken a big stake in Rivian.</p><p>Lucid Motors makes luxury electric cars and S.U.V.s but has fallen well short of its original sales and production targets. It, too, is hoping to make deals in which it sells its technology to other automakers.</p><p>“Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” Steve Girsky, Nikola’s chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday. “Unfortunately, our very best efforts have not been enough to overcome these significant challenges.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Neal E.
