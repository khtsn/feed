    <h1>Israeli Spy Chief to Step Down After Clash With Netanyahu</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A career intelligence officer, Mr. Bar assumed his position at the pinnacle of the Shin Bet in 2021. Two years later, Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel that ignited the war. The attack that day killed about 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and saw 250 people taken hostage to Gaza. The subsequent Israeli military campaign left more than 50,000 Palestinians dead, according to Gaza health officials.</p><p>As head of the Shin Bet, Mr. Bar has played a key role in Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. His agency also helps oversee the decades-long Israeli military occupation of the West Bank, where millions of Palestinians live under Israeli control. </p><p>The failure to prevent Hamas’s assault — the deadliest day in Israeli history — hangs heavy over the legacy of all of Israel’s leaders at the time, including Mr. Bar. As the war in Gaza has dragged on, at least some have begun to resign; Mr. Bar said he, too, would bow out at an appropriate time. </p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has generally avoided publicly admitting fault for the strategy that enabled Hamas to grow strong enough to stage such an ambitious attack. He has occasionally tried to shift responsibility to security officials like Mr. Bar, accusing them of providing him with poor counsel. </p><p>In his affidavit, Mr. Netanyahu contended that he lost confidence in Mr. Bar during the devastating Hamas-led attacks, blaming him for not foreseeing it. </p><p>Mr. Bar argued that Mr. Netanyahu’s desire to fire him began after a series of moves in late 2024 and early 2025, including his decision to investigate Netanyahu aides suspected of security breaches in cases involving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/middleeast/israel-document-leaks.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">classified documents</a> leaks, along with improper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-netanyahu.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">ties to Qatar</a>.</p><p>Isabel Kershner<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div>
