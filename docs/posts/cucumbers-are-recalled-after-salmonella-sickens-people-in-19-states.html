No deaths have been reported.</p><p>The C.D.C. said it was working with public health and regulatory officials in several states, including the Food and Drug Administration, to investigate the infections.</p><p>The cucumbers were sold in the United States and Canada, according to the F.D.A.</p><p>SunFed recalled all sizes of the product described as “whole fresh American cucumbers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Craig Slate, the president of SunFed, said in a statement that the company “immediately acted to protect consumers.”</p><p>“We are working closely with authorities and the implicated ranch to determine the possible cause,” <a href="https://www.sunfed.net/press.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>.</p><p>The recalled cucumbers were sold in more than half the states between Oct. 12 and Nov. 26, according to SunFed, and they were shipped to the following states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</p><p>SunFed said it’s possible that contaminated cucumbers also reached consumers through retailers in other states.</p><p>The cucumbers, which were packaged in bulk cardboard containers with the “SunFed” label or in a generic white box or black plastic crate with a sticker that provides the grower’s name, were also sold in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Calgary, Ontario and Saskatchewan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The C.D.C. cautioned that “the true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses.”</p><p>The agency advised consumers to look for a sticker that shows “SunFed Mexico” as the place where the cucumbers were grown and to throw away or return any recalled cucumbers.</p><p>The C.D.C. also advised consumers to throw out any cucumbers bought between Oct. 12 and Nov. 26 if they do not know where they were grown.</p><p>On Thursday, both Wegmans and Walmart alerted their customers to the recall. Walmart <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/recalls/2024/11/Sunfed-Fresh-American-Cucumbers-Store-List.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a list</a> of the stores where the cucumbers were sold.
