As written, the legislation would cut health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Mr. Musk said in the interview to be broadcast on Sunday that he was not sold on a bill that had emerged as the president’s top legislative priority. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,” Mr. Musk said. “But I don’t know if it can be both.”</p><p>A combination of Mr. Trump’s lobbying and compromises struck by Speaker Mike Johnson managed to get the bill through the House, but it faces significant hurdles in the Senate. Republicans hold only a slim margin in the chamber, and two <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/fiscal-hawks-senate-house-bill.html" title="">fiscal conservatives</a> have said they want significant changes on the grounds that the bill lacks specific measures to reduce the national deficit.</p><p>Asked about Mr. Musk’s comments on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump declined to engage directly with them. But he defended the bill generally and said it contained the provisions it did because “No. 1, we have to get a lot of votes,” with Democrats unified in opposition.</p><p>If the bill is not approved, Mr. Trump said, “this country is going to get a 65 percent increase in taxes and lots of other problems, big problems, almost bigger than that.” He added, “We will be negotiating that bill and I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it. That’s the way that goes.”</p><p>Mr. Musk — who spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-rbg-election.html" title="">more than $250 million to help Mr. Trump’s campaign</a> — joined the White House as a “special government employee” to lead the DOGE effort, which Mr. Trump hailed as one of his biggest accomplishments. The effort, which set the lofty goal of slashing $1 trillion from the federal budget but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">has fallen far short of that goal</a>, has led to clashes with cabinet secretaries and complaints from some lawmakers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Musk’s support for Mr. Trump has also caused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk.html" title="">sales to plummet at Tesla</a>, his electric car company, and last week the billionaire said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-political-spending.html" title="">spend less time</a> in Washington and more time running his companies.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
