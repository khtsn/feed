    <h1>Appeals Court Blocks Trump Firings, Reinstating 2 Federal Board Leaders</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By design, both boards are made up of members serving longer stints than a four-year presidential term in order to encourage a nonpartisan makeup and keep the independent agencies insulated from political pressures. Members of the M.S.P.B. are confirmed by the Senate to serve for one nonrenewable seven-year term, and members of the N.L.R.B. serve for five years.</p><p>The legal arguments over their fate mirrored the earlier case of Hampton Dellinger, whose job involved investigating the claims of federal workers who believed they had been wrongfully terminated. Mr. Trump removed him in February.</p><p>Mr. Dellinger’s lawsuit challenging his removal was the first to reach the Supreme Court, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-special-counsel.html" title="">halted his imminent suspension</a> but did not resolve the underlying questions about the president’s power to remove Mr. Dellinger and those serving in similar positions. In March, Mr. Dellinger <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html" title="">decided</a> to abandon the legal struggle to remain in his position.</p><p>In a series of much longer dissenting opinions, the judges who voted against the reinstatement wrote that the decision trampled on the president’s ability to carry out his agenda. They wrote that the precedent set in Humphrey’s Executor has been significantly eroded over time, and that the decision forced the boards to accept Ms. Harris and Ms. Wilcox back on the job after they had already been sidelined from their positions for weeks.</p><p>“Harris and Wilcox are no longer in office,” Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, wrote in a dissenting opinion. “The district court purported to reinstate these officers by simply declaring they were never removed in the first place and ordering executive branch officials to play along.”</p><p>The order on Monday also denied a request by the government to pause the reinstatement for seven days in order to allow the government time to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court.</p></div></div>
