It tees up an expected finale in which the Supreme Court will be asked to issue the final word on whether Mr. Trump can unilaterally shake up the boards’ leadership.</p><p>By a 7-4 vote, the court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.41769/gov.uscourts.cadc.41769.01208727297.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voided</a> an earlier <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rXhRVlg8DdKI/v0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision</a> by a divided three-judge panel that had cleared the way for the Trump administration to remove <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-fires-government-employees.html" title="">Cathy Harris</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-firing-labor-supreme-court.html" title="">Gwynne A.

Wilcox, left, of the National Labor Relations Board in January, and Cathy Harris of the Merit Systems Protection Board in February. </figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Both women found themselves targets of the president amid his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-biden-law-firms-revenge.html" title="">broader campaign</a> to centralize power and eliminate constraints on his ability to fire federal workers and decimate the federal service.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his advisers have faced a raft of legal challenges over their attempts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-doge-federal-job-cuts.html" title="">fire federal workers</a> en masse, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/usaid-trump-doge-cuts.html" title="">practically eliminate entire agencies</a> such as the United States Agency for International Development, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-unions-executive-order.html" title="">end collective bargaining</a> with federal unions.</p><p>Mr. Trump and many of his closest advisers, including Vice President JD Vance, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/opinion/jd-vance-interview.html" title="">came to see</a> the federal bureaucracy as one of the major impediments to his agenda during his first term. In seeking to remove Ms. Harris, Ms. Wilcox and others in similar positions, he has worked to sideline any stumbling blocks to cutting through that bureaucracy in his second term.</p><p>In a concise three-page opinion, the majority wrote that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/us/trump-supreme-court-special-counsel.html" title="">the legal precedent</a> from 1935 set in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States still required it to afford certain protections to the heads of agencies created by Congress to serve as nonpartisan adjudicatory bodies. They reasoned that until the high court advised otherwise, Ms. Harris and Ms. Wilcox could not be summarily removed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By design, both boards are made up of members serving longer stints than a four-year presidential term in order to encourage a nonpartisan makeup and keep the independent agencies insulated from political pressures. Members of the M.S.P.B. are confirmed by the Senate to serve for one nonrenewable seven-year term, and members of the N.L.R.B. serve for five years.</p><p>The legal arguments over their fate mirrored the earlier case of Hampton Dellinger, whose job involved investigating the claims of federal workers who believed they had been wrongfully terminated. Mr. Trump removed him in February.</p><p>Mr. Dellinger’s lawsuit challenging his removal was the first to reach the Supreme Court, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-special-counsel.html" title="">halted his imminent suspension</a> but did not resolve the underlying questions about the president’s power to remove Mr. Dellinger and those serving in similar positions. In March, Mr. Dellinger <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/hampton-dellinger-firing.html" title="">decided</a> to abandon the legal struggle to remain in his position.</p><p>In a series of much longer dissenting opinions, the judges who voted against the reinstatement wrote that the decision trampled on the president’s ability to carry out his agenda. They wrote that the precedent set in Humphrey’s Executor has been significantly eroded over time, and that the decision forced the boards to accept Ms. Harris and Ms. Wilcox back on the job after they had already been sidelined from their positions for weeks.</p><p>“Harris and Wilcox are no longer in office,” Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, wrote in a dissenting opinion. “The district court purported to reinstate these officers by simply declaring they were never removed in the first place and ordering executive branch officials to play along.”</p><p>The order on Monday also denied a request by the government to pause the reinstatement for seven days in order to allow the government time to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Framing the Past by Erasing Parts of It: </strong>As the Trump administration pulls government websites and data offline, it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/technology/trump-history-websites.html">selectively stripping away the public record</a>, letting President Trump declare his own version of history, archivists and historians said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weakened Cyberdefenses, Rising Danger:</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/nsa-director-haugh-trump-loomer.html">firing of the head of the National Security Agency</a> was only the latest move that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/trump-loomer-haugh-cyberattacks-elections.html">eroded the country’s fortifications against cyberattacks</a>, especially those targeting elections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loomer’s Role in Firings:</strong> The firing of national security officials on the advice of Laura Loomer, a far-right agitator and conspiracy theorist, unsettled even some veteran Trump officials.
