Philip D. Murphy announced on Thursday.</p><p>The unusual “fare holiday” on all modes of the agency’s statewide transit network, which will run from Aug. 26 through Sept. 2, comes less than two months after New Jersey Transit raised all of its fares by 15 percent. The increase received <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/nyregion/nj-transit-delays-fare-hike.html" title="">heavy criticism</a> from customers and elected officials.</p><p>Mr. Murphy and state transportation officials argued that the fare increase was necessary to close a gap of more than $100 million in the agency’s budget. Additional annual increases of 3 percent are scheduled.</p><p>Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said in a statement that the fare holiday was a “thank you” to the agency’s loyal customers for enduring a period when “transit service has not consistently met their expectations — or our own.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>During an appearance on “Good Day New York” on Fox 5 New York, the governor said, more plainly: “It’s been a really ugly summer. I think June was one of the worst months we’ve had.”</p><p>Critics immediately took to social media to carp about the choice of the week leading up to Labor Day, a time when many commuters are on vacation.</p><p>For those who have already bought monthly passes for August, the fare breaks will include a 25 percent discount on September passes, Mr. Murphy said. That means that after costing 15 percent more in July and August than in June, monthly passes will cost about 15 percent less for some people in September than they did in June.</p><p>“Any relief for riders is good,” said Jaqi Cohen, director of climate and equity policy for Tri-State Transportation Campaign. “But people are commuting every day, so they’re going to be paying more in the long run.”</p><p>“This fare holiday is a gimmick,” said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst with New Jersey Policy Perspective. “This will not substantially help riders who have been suffering under the neglect of Transit for decades.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Neither the governor nor the agency provided any information about how the fare breaks would affect New Jersey Transit’s shaky financial situation. In June, Mr. Murphy signed a bill that created a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/nyregion/new-jersey-transit-taxes.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">2.5 percent surtax</a> on the state’s most profitable companies to provide the agency with an additional source of revenue.</p><p>After a spate of failures that caused delays during morning and evening commutes in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/nyregion/amtrak-nj-transit-service.html" title="">May</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/nyregion/nj-transit-amtrak-penn-station-delays.html" title="">June</a>, New Jersey Transit and Amtrak officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/nyregion/nj-transit-amtrak-delays.html" title="">began a thorough investigation</a> into the causes. Amtrak owns the Northeast Corridor, the main line through New Jersey, as well as the tunnels under the Hudson River and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.</p><p>But after weeks of studying the matter, the two railroads say that they have not determined what the problems were. In a statement this week, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit said, “the ongoing investigations into the root cause(s) of the recent incidents on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor have not, so far, yielded any evidence” that the failures could be pinned on the equipment that connects either railroad’s engines to the overhead wires that provide power to them.</p><p>“However, we are not ruling anything out,” the spokesman wrote. He said the railroads were conducting a “comprehensive joint review of all infrastructure that might contribute to a disruption in rail service for customers along the Northeast Corridor.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the economy of New York City and its airports and other transportation hubs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-mcgeehan">More about Patrick McGeehan</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tragic End to an Instagram-Perfect Hamptons Life: </strong>A couple showed the public a world of glittering parties and vacations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/nyregion/brandon-miller-suicide-debt.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The money to sustain it did not exist</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brooklyn’s Great Goldfish Heist: </strong>In Bedford-Stuyvesant, an animal lover thought she was doing the right thing by freeing fish from a sidewalk pit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/goldfish-sidewalk-pond-brooklyn.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">But was it a rescue or a robbery</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Zombie Pharmacies: </strong>Over a million square feet of prime real estate is collecting dust across New York City. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/pharmacies-vacant-drugstores-retail.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">It could stay that way for years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Street Wars: </strong>New York City bus stops without trees or shelter are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/nyregion/street-wars-hot-bus-stops.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">leaving riders sweating</a> as they wait — and wait — for buses that a transportation group says do not come fast enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine: </strong>Jackie Chang, a subway mosaic artist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/nyregion/jackie-chang-subway-mosaics.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">spends her Sundays</a> designing in her studio, making Taiwanese breakfast and practicing violin.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div></div></div>
