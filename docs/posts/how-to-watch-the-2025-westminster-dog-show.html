A group of New York Times journalists will be providing up-to-the-minute live analysis of the competition, in which seven group winners will face off at Madison Square Garden in hopes of capturing best in show.</p><h3 id="link-1a030ceb"><span>What time does the show start?</span></h3><p>The judging of breeds and groups began on Monday, but the final three groups, and best in show, will be decided in a prime-time event that starts at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday.</p><h3 id="link-7d9278e5"><span>Where can you watch it?</span></h3><p>The evening’s events, including a pregame show that begins at 7 p.m., will air on FS1 and will be streamed on the Fox Sports app. For people who enjoy a second-screen experience, there will be live coverage from New York Times reporters at the Garden.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h3 id="link-1005d51d"><span>What dogs will be competing?</span></h3><p>Before best in show is decided, the judges will have to determine the winners of the sporting, working and terrier groups.

While Lyndhurst, an estate in suburban Tarrytown, and the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens both helped the organization get through the pandemic, nothing matches the energy of the arena the event has called home since 1877 (with shows having been held in all four incarnations of the Garden).</p><h3 id="link-441bf0fe"><span>Who won last year?</span></h3><p>Sage, a miniature poodle, took best in show last year, beating out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/style/westminster-dog-show-best-in-show.html" title="">a talented field</a>.</p><h3 id="link-1c76283d"><span>Seriously though, is a golden retriever or a lab ever going to win?</span></h3><p>Probably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/style/westminster-preview-golden-retrievers.html" title="">not</a>. But that will only make them more lovable.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Hoffman is a senior editor who writes, assigns and edits stories primarily on the intersection between sports, lifestyle and culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-hoffman">More about Benjamin Hoffman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
