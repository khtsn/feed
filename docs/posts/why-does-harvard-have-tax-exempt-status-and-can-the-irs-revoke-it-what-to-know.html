Under the Internal Revenue Code, none of the organization’s earnings can go to a private shareholder or individual; the organization is limited in its ability to influence legislation and it cannot participate in a campaign or support political candidates.</p><h2 id="link-6c94d68">Why do Harvard and other universities claim it?</h2><p>Simply put, tax-exempt status saves money and can boost credibility. It can also help attract wealthy individuals seeking to donate large sums. </p><p>Institutions must apply to the I.R.S. for tax exemption, and a vast majority of universities do so, according to the Association of American Universities. This is because of their educational purpose, which “the federal government has long recognized as fundamental to fostering the productive and civic capacities of citizens,” the <a href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/tax-exempt-status-universities-and-colleges" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">association says</a>.</p><h2 id="link-38304f70">Can the I.R.S. revoke tax-exempt status?</h2><p>The I.R.S. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p892.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">determines</a> which organizations meet the criteria for tax-exempt status. The agency has at times revoked tax-exempt status, including after audits that found political or commercial activities that violated the terms of eligibility.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the past, the I.R.S. has challenged the tax exemptions of educational and other institutions under both Republican and Democratic administrations, according to Gowri Krishna, a professor at Fordham University School of Law who specializes in nonprofit law.</p><p>In one well-known example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/forceful-term-of-supreme-court-put-reins-on-congress-and-reagan.html" title="">Bob Jones University</a> in South Carolina, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/education/christian-school-faulted-for-halting-abuse-study.html" title="">fundamentalist Christian institution</a> that had banned interracial dating, lost its tax-exempt status over its discriminatory policies in a case that the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled on</a> in 1983. The university had claimed that the I.R.S. had violated its religious liberty. The university <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/030400bobjones-edu.html?Partner=iVillage&amp;RefId=LmyyW=jEFnnnnNnwm" title="">lifted the ban</a> in 2000, and said in 2017 that it had regained its tax-exempt status.</p><p>But it is rare for the I.R.S. to revoke the tax-exempt status of an educational institution. Tax laws also provide organizations the right to appeal an adverse decision by the agency.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/divulge_all_suspected_tax_exempt_status_abuses_to_the_irs.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agency says</a> that it receives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html" title="">complaints</a> claiming abuse of tax-exempt status every year from the public, members of Congress, state and federal government agencies and internal sources. But federal law bars the president or other senior officials of the executive branch from directly or indirectly requesting that the I.R.S. investigate or audit specific organizations.</p><p>Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said that the I.R.S. began scrutinizing Harvard before the president’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html" title="">public call</a> for Harvard to pay taxes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a statement, Harvard said that there was no legal basis for rescinding its tax status. Any attempt to take away Harvard’s tax exemption would be likely to face a legal challenge, which tax and legal experts expect would be successful.</p><p>“Harvard would argue there’s a violation of its free speech and academic freedom,” Ms. Krishna said. “I think it would be highly, highly unlikely that the government would win.”</p><h2 id="link-4f6e304b">What would happen if Harvard lost its tax-exempt status?</h2><p>Harvard has said that losing its tax exemption would result in the reduction of financial aid for students, the abandonment of important medical research and the loss of other opportunities for innovation.</p><p>Bloomberg News estimated in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-harvard-property-tax/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a> that Harvard’s tax benefits totaled at least $465 million in 2023. The university also indirectly benefits from the tax deduction that its donors receive from making contributions. In the 2024 fiscal year, Harvard <a href="https://finance.harvard.edu/files/fad/files/fy24_harvard_financial_report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that it had collected more than $525 million in donations that could be used immediately.</p><p>Rescinding Harvard’s tax exemption would also have “grave consequences” for higher education in general, the university said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>And an attempt to change Harvard’s tax-exempt status amid its dispute with the Trump administration would amount to a severe breach of the independence of the I.R.S., which was established to be insulated from political pressure.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 17, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the extent to which a tax-exempt organization can work to influence legislation.
