			<p>Stew really should go to Korea, heâ€™s way undervalued. I know he speaks a little Chinese, but I think a lot of his shakiness this season has been due in part to the language barrier.</p>
<p>He could do really well on a KR T2 team.</p>		</div>

		<p>Bro, the whole RA core roster was picked up by JDG back at the start of 2024 after ascension, and now none of the original RA roster are still &#34;active&#34; on this team, wdym he&#39;s still in RA</p>
