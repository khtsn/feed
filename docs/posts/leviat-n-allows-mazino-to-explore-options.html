<p>He revealed that his contract with the organization is set to expire, but that he is still a restricted free agent.</p>

<p>&#34;My contract with Leviat√°n is coming to an end soon, and even if we are exploring an extension, I&#39;ve also been allowed to explore all my options as a Restricted Free Agent,&#34; Mazino said. </p>

<p>Before being signed by Leviat√°n following the 2022 season, Mazino played for <span data-ref-id="2">

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2462/keznit">
		keznit	</a>
</span>, was signed by Leviat√°n as the team&#39;s fifth and sixth player. The duo were also founding members of the Argentinian organization. keznit has since returned to KR√ú.</p>

<p>The former CS:GO player played a key role in Leviat√°n&#39;s success after a less-than-ideal start to their 2024 season. After being eliminated in the Swiss Stage of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a>, they parted ways with head coach <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3055/goked">
		goked	</a>
</span> and promoted assistant <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/333/itopata">
		Itopata	</a>
</span> to head coach.</p>

<p>Most well-known for his play on Harbor and Breach, Mazino and Leviat√°n enjoyed a successful 2024, lifting the organization&#39;s first trophy at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2095/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">VCT: Americas Stage 2</a> and achieving a third-placed finish at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions Seoul</a>.</p>

<p>&#34;I&#39;m open to any region and I will try my best to win,&#34; he said.</p>
