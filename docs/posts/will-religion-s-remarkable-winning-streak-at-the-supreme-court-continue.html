Roberts Jr.: to bolster the place of faith in public life.</p><p>The hiatus is over. In the space of a month this spring, the court will hear three important religion cases. The first one, to be argued Monday, asks whether a Catholic charity in Wisconsin should receive a tax exemption. In April, the court will consider whether a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma is constitutional and whether parents with religious objections to the curriculum in Maryland schools may withdraw their children from classes.</p><p>Taken together, the three cases will test the limits of the court’s assertive vision of religious liberty, which has been one of its distinctive commitments for more than a decade.</p><p>Since 2012, when the court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/us/supreme-court-recognizes-religious-exception-to-job-discrimination-laws.html" title="">unanimously ruled</a> that religious groups were often exempt from employment discrimination laws, the pro-religion side has won all but one of the 16 signed decisions in argued cases that concerned the First Amendment’s prohibition of government establishment of religion and its protection of the free exercise of religion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Religious liberty has been on a winning streak at the Supreme Court since 2012,” said Eric Rassbach, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the plaintiffs in two of the three cases to be argued this spring. “It isn’t yet on par with freedom of speech, but it is getting a lot closer.”</p><p>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh expressed satisfaction with the general trend in <a href="https://www.law.edu/news-and-events/2024/09/2024-0926-KavanaughTalk.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remarks at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law</a> in September. Asked to identify “some of the big themes of the court’s religious liberty cases in recent years,” he said, “We’ve made, in my view, correct and important strides” in “recognizing the constitutional protection of religious equality and religious liberty.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Justice Brett M.

The two education cases, Professor Driver said, are particularly fraught.</p><p>“The Supreme Court this term could quite plausibly destroy the American public school as we have known it for the last several decades,” he said. “Of course, many conservatives will regard that destruction not as a vice, but a virtue.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There has been one exception to religion’s winning streak at the court in the last decade: the justices’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html" title="">rejection in 2018</a> of a challenge to the first Trump administration’s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.</p><p>That is telling, said Rachel Laser, the president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. “The law used to bend over backwards to protect religious minorities,” she said. “Now it’s Christians, and oftentimes conservative Christians, who are repeatedly being favored by Supreme Court rulings.”</p><p>The court has ruled in recent years that state programs supporting private schools in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/us/politics/supreme-court-maine-religious-schools.html" title="">Maine</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/supreme-court-religious-schools-aid.html" title="">Montana</a> must allow parents to choose religious ones, a boon to Christian schools. On April 30, the court will hear arguments on a variation on that question, but with an important twist.</p><p>The new case asks whether Oklahoma must use government money to pay for a religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, to be operated by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa and dedicated to infusing its curriculum with Catholic teaching.</p><p>The schools in the earlier cases were private. Under Oklahoma law, charter schools are public.</p><p>“It would be a sea change to allow public schools, or any schools that are directly funded with tax dollars, to be religious schools,” Ms. Laser said. “You’re talking about your neighborhood school becoming a Sunday school.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Gentner Drummond, Oklahoma’s attorney general, a Republican, opposed the religious charter school, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2024/121694.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled against it</a>, saying it violated the First Amendment’s prohibition of government establishment of religion and the state Constitution’s ban on spending public money to support religious institutions.</p><p>In its brief to the U.S. Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-394/351350/20250305181244391_24-396%2024-394%20Brief%20for%20Petitioner.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the school argued</a> that it is like the ones in the cases from Maine and Montana.</p><p>St. Isidore “hopes to offer another educational <em>option</em> for Oklahomans, and no student will be compelled to attend St. Isidore,” the brief said. “Rather, the school will receive students, and state funding, only through the private choices of families.”</p><p>Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said the case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-394.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond</a>, No. 24-394, “almost just comes down to an issue of characterization.”</p><p>“Is a charter school a public school with private management, or is it a private school with public funding?” he asked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case but has not said why.

For most of that academic year, school administrators gave parents notice when the storybooks were to be discussed, along with the opportunity to have their children excused from those sessions.

Roberts Jr. joined the court in 2005 found that the nature of its rulings had changed from those issued by the courts led by Chief Justices Earl Warren, Warren E. Burger and William H. Rehnquist.</p><p>The study, conducted by Lee Epstein, of Washington University in St. Louis, and Eric Posner, of the University of Chicago, found that the Roberts court ruled in favor of religious people and groups over 83 percent of the time, compared to about 50 percent of the time for other courts since 1953.</p><p>“In most of these cases, the winning religion was a mainstream Christian organization, whereas in the past pro-religion outcomes more frequently favored minority or marginal religious organizations,” they wrote.</p><p>The study considered cases that turned on the First Amendment’s religion clauses, but religion has also figured in other cases. In 2023, for instance, the court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/us/politics/supreme-court-religion-sabbath-postal-worker.html" title="">unanimously ruled</a> in favor of a postal worker who refused to work on his Sabbath under an employment discrimination law. That same year, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html" title="">split 6-to-3</a> in favor of a web designer who did not want to create sites for same-sex weddings under the First Amendment’s free speech clause.</p><p>The rate of pro-religion rulings from the Roberts court has risen since the study was conducted, to 86 percent, Professor Epstein found. If the court rules in favor of religious claims in all three of the pending cases, the rate will rise again, to 88 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-23"></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>March 30, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the day the Supreme Court will hear an argument on the tax status of a Wisconsin charity.
