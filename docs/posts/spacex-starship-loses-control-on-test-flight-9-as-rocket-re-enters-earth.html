But halfway through its uncrewed journey, the spacecraft sprang a propellant leak. That caused it to start spinning out of control. The Starship vehicle used in the test flight was not able to survive the intense heat, breaking up as it fell back into the atmosphere.</p><p>By design, the debris fell into the Indian Ocean, far from areas inhabited by people.</p><p>That suggests SpaceX engineers still have much work to do with Starship, especially the upper-stage vehicle, before the spacecraft can be reused frequently, a necessity for fulfilling the vision of Elon Musk, who founded the company in order to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/30/science/mars-landing-trump.html" title="">send people to Mars one day.</a></p><p>Several tests that SpaceX planned during the flight, the ninth, were not conducted.</p><p>Several hours before the launch, Mr. Musk told Tim Dodd, a space journalist who hosts the <a href="https://x.com/Erdayastronaut/status/1927466323862335651" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Everyday Astronaut” video podcast</a>, that “by far the most important thing” was the re-entry portion of the test flight. The heat protection on the underside of the spacecraft included several variations to see what might work best.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s all about the tiles,” Mr. Musk said.</p><p>Because the spacecraft was spinning by then, that data was not collected, and the tests will have to be attempted again on the next flight.</p><p>There was nonetheless progress during the flight, which lifted off from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/05/us/elon-musk-starbase-texas.html" title="">Starbase, Texas</a>, around 7:37 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>The company appears to have fixed the problems that caused the spacecraft to explode during the ascent of the two previous test flights.</p><p>“Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!” Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1927531406017601915" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> after the flight’s end. “Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase.”</p><p>The mission also flew a booster that had been used for an earlier test flight in January — important progress toward demonstrating a rocket that can be flown over and over.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But that too also was an incomplete achievement. While the re-flown Super Heavy booster worked on the way up, it was lost as three engines lit up to simulate a landing over the Gulf of Mexico. However, SpaceX was attempting various tests to push the performance of the booster, suggesting that the outcome may not have been a major setback.”</p><p>Mr. Musk had planned to deliver a talk earlier on Tuesday before the launch titled “The Road to Making Life Interplanetary.” But a minutes after it was set to begin, he announced it was postponed until after the test flight.</p><p>He made no mention of it after the test flight.</p><p>In his post-launch X post, he said the next three Starship test flights would occur at a faster pace, one every three to four weeks.</p><p>Mr. Musk often sets out unrealistic schedules, and progress on Starship has been slower than he promised. SpaceX is to provide Starship as the lunar lander for Artemis III, the NASA mission that is to return astronauts to the surface of the moon in a couple of years. That contract is worth several billion dollars, but Mr. Musk does not appear particularly enthusiastic about it.</p><p>During his conversation with Mr. Dodd, Mr. Musk described the goals of the Artemis program, which was created during the President Trump’s first administration, as “objectively feeble.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We should either do a base on the moon, or we should send people to Mars,” Mr. Musk said.</p><p>As part of his Mars goals, Elon Musk has said that the company would <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1837908705683059166" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">send about five Starships there next year</a> — sans astronauts, but <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1900774290682683612" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with Optimus robots</a> built by his electric car company, Tesla.</p><p>Both the moon and Mars plans require major advances not yet attempted including multiple launches in quick succession and transferring propellants from one Starship to another.</p><h2 id="link-194b2117">What happened during the 7th and 8th flights?</h2><p>SpaceX takes pride in its “fail quickly and fix quickly” approach to rocket design, so it is not surprising that none of the eight test flights so far have worked perfectly. But the last two — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/science/spacex-starship-test-launch-7.html" title="">flight seven in January</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/science/spacex-starship-launch.html" title="">flight eight in March</a> — were more disappointing. They <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/science/starship-spacex-explosion-elon-musk.html" title="">could not repeat the successes</a> of earlier test flights.</p><p>For both flights, the upper-stage vehicles, known as Starships, exploded during ascent. Showers of falling debris over the Atlantic Ocean surprised sky watchers in Caribbean countries and Florida, and disrupted air traffic in the region. No one was injured.</p><p>In contrast, the vehicles used in flights four, five and six made it into space, coasted halfway around the world, survived re-entry into the atmosphere and simulated landings in the Indian Ocean.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In flights seven and eight, both explosions occurred at about the same point in the flight, just before the second-stage engines cut off. But the causes were “distinctly different,” SpaceX said in <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates/#flight-8-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an update last week</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A screengrab from a video posted on X showed debris from a Starship explosion over Hog Cay in the Bahamas on March 6.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">@Genedoctorb/X, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Super Heavy booster returning to the launch pad at Starbase in Texas during the same launch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Skipper/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For the seventh flight, SpaceX said that the probable cause was stronger than expected rhythmic oscillations. The vibrations caused leaks of propellant that caught fire.</p><p>Fixes intended to damp the vibrations worked during the eighth flight, SpaceX said.</p><p>However, during the eighth flight, a flash was seen near the bottom of the second-stage vehicle near one of the center engines. That engine then failed. Three other engines then shut down, and SpaceX lost control of the vehicle about nine and a half minutes after launch.</p><p>SpaceX said the most probable cause was a hardware failure in one of the engines “that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>While the upper-stage vehicles failed during the last two launches, the giant first-stage boosters, known as Super Heavy, each successfully returned to the launch site, where they were caught in midair by giant mechanical arms.</p><h2 id="link-3b5df45d">What was different during this launch?</h2><p>This launch tried to conduct tests that were left undone during the two previous flights. Those included deploying simulators of SpaceX’s next-generation Starlink internet satellites. However, the payload door failed to open before the spacecraft started spinning, and the simulators remained inside the spacecraft.</p><p>During earlier flights, the vehicle’s Super Heavy booster returned to the launch site and was caught by a pair of mechanical arms. This time, SpaceX had a different, more ambitious plan: It re-flew the booster from flight seven, hoping to demonstrate that its design is, indeed, reusable.</p><p> It also tested whether it can still perform a landing maneuver if one of the center engines shuts down and a different engine has to be used. This is the point of the flight where the booster failed.</p><p>The booster disintegrated over the Gulf of Mexico.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
