Cordasco, 49, and Anthony M. Saccavino, 59 — were responsible for overseeing safety inspections on building projects. Neither man could immediately be reached for comment Monday morning. It was unclear whether either had retained lawyers in the matter, which has been under investigation since last summer.</p><p>There is no indication that the case is related to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">any of the four separate federal corruption investigations</a> swirling around Mayor Eric Adams, his campaign and some of his most senior aides. The inquiry focused on the mayor is being conducted by the same agencies that investigated the chiefs, however, and also relates in part to fire safety inspections, several of the people said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The charges against the chiefs are likely to increase the pressure on Mr. Adams and his administration as it faces a welter of corruption investigations that led last week to the resignations of two top officials in three days.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index-articleLarge-v2.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Tracking Investigations In Eric Adams’s Orbit</h2><p>Several federal corruption inquiries have reached into the world of Mayor Eric Adams of New York, who faces re-election next year. Here is a closer look at how people with ties to Adams are related to the inquiries.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The mayor’s police commissioner, Edward Caban, whose phone was seized days earlier by federal agents in a corruption inquiry focused on his twin brother, resigned on Thursday.</p><p>On Saturday, the mayor’s chief counsel, a former federal prosecutor from the Southern District with a reputation for integrity, also resigned, a move that two people with knowledge of the matter said was largely borne of frustration because the mayor was not following her advice on certain personnel matters.</p><p>The United States Attorney in Manhattan, Damian Williams, is overseeing the case against the chiefs as well as three of the four corruption inquiries involving the mayor and his aides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Williams was expected to announce the indictment of the chiefs at a news conference Monday morning. He will be joined by the city’s Department of Investigation commissioner, Jocelyn E. Strauber, and the head of New York’s F.B.I. Office, James E. Dennehy, whose agencies jointly conducted the inquiry.</p><p>The Fire Department put both men on modified duty and removed them from their positions overseeing inspections after the searches of Mr. Cordasco’s home in Staten Island and Mr. Saccavino’s home in Harlem. Both men, one official said, have remained on modified duty.</p><p>The investigation into the chiefs has been unfolding for at least a year and was focused at least in part on whether they had accepted bribes to help expedite or influence fire inspections on building projects, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.</p><p>Investigators were examining whether each man received $97,000 from a recently retired firefighter, the people said. One of the payments was made to a limited liability company registered to Mr. Cordasco’s home address, the people said. It was unclear precisely what the payments were for and whether the retired firefighter had made them on behalf of himself or someone else.</p><p>City Payroll records show that in 2023, the Fire Department paid Mr. Saccavino $241,119 and Mr. Cordasco $235,462.</p><p>Dana Rubinstein<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
