The parents had sued because the schools had stopped allowing them to withdraw their children from classes in which books with L.G.B.T.Q. themes were discussed.</p><p>It was a long, lively and sometimes heated argument, our Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak said. The court’s six-justice conservative majority <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/supreme-court-lgbtq-books.html" title="">indicated that it was likely to side with the parents</a>, who argued that their religious objections were constitutionally protected.</p><p>“The plaintiffs here are not asking the school to change its curriculum,” Justice Samuel Alito said. “They’re just saying, ‘Look, we want out.’ Why isn’t that feasible?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As secretary of state, Marco Rubio has hewed closely to President Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-53ba06d9">Rubio announced major cuts at the State Department</h2><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio unveiled a plan today to significantly overhaul the State Department, which he called “bloated,” “bureaucratic” and “beholden to radical political ideology.” The most dramatic change would be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/state-department-cuts-rubio.html" title="">elimination of an office that is charged with defending democracy and human rights</a> around the world.</p><p>The nation’s diplomatic agency is planning to cut its number of offices and bureaus by 18 percent, in addition to eliminating 15 percent of its U.S.-based workers. Officials said that closures of diplomatic missions and overseas layoffs are expected later.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>the Trump administration told its diplomats in Vietnam to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/world/asia/us-diplomats-vietnam-war-anniversary-trump.html" title="">avoid events marking the 50th anniversary</a> of the end of the war.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cody O&#39;Loughlin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo from the Vatican showed Pope Francis’ body in his private chapel. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Vatican</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2e5ec6b3">A carefully choreographed farewell began</h2><p>Pope Francis’ open coffin was in a chapel today at his residence, which had always been an unusually humble home for a pope. Tomorrow, the coffin will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/21/world/pope-francis-death-news" title="">taken in a procession to St. Peter’s Basilica</a> to lie in state, with mourners allowed to visit.</p><p>Then, on Saturday at 10 a.m. local time, the pope’s funeral will begin, featuring simpler rituals in keeping with the informal style that became a trademark of Francis’ papacy. Presidents, prime ministers and royalty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/world/europe/pope-francis-funeral-guests.html" title="">are planning to attend</a>.
