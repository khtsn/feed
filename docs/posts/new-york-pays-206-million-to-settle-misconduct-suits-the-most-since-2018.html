Two were from the wrongful convictions of James Irons and Thomas Malik, who in 1995 were charged with the murder of a subway clerk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>After spending three decades behind bars, Mr. Irons and Mr. Malik <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/nyregion/subway-murder-false-conviction-exonerated.html" title="">were exonerated</a> by a judge who found that the police had elicited false confessions from them. Both were awarded about $16.3 million last year.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thomas Malik, left, and James Irons were freed after years behind bars.

Under that law, the state began requiring district attorneys to turn over evidence to defense lawyers within 90 days for misdemeanors and six months for felonies.</p><p>In January, Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/fighting-recidivism-district-attorneys-endorse-governor-hochuls-plan-streamline-discovery-laws" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed changes to that law</a>. The legislation, she said, had allowed defense lawyers to retroactively challenge prosecutors’ compliance on rules that could lead to the dismissal of cases on what she said were technicalities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Condliffe said any rollbacks to the law would lead to police and prosecutorial misconduct, more wrongful convictions and costlier settlements.</p><p>“It’s incredible that in a moment where we are seeing some of the largest payouts in our state’s history, we’re also at a moment where the governor is trying to dismantle this really important law,” Ms. Condliffe said.</p><p>The amount of money that the city has spent on misconduct settlements has fluctuated over the past several years. In 2018, the city paid about $76.5 million to settle 1,577 cases, according to Legal Aid. Three years later, the amount rose to $88.2 million for 762 settlements.</p><p>By 2022, the cost of police misconduct settlements jumped to $135.4 million. Six suits that amounted to about $73 million — including one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/nyregion/malcom-x-muhammad-aziz-khalil-islam-settlement.html" title="">for Muhammad A. Aziz</a>, whose conviction in the <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/02/22/101528359.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;ip=0" title="">assassination of Malcolm X</a> was thrown out after he spent two decades in prison — accounted for much of the increase.</p><p>Some of the other top payouts last year were for Gary Johnson and Rohan Bolt, who were convicted in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/nyregion/off-duty-police-officer-and-store-owner-are-slain-in-queens.html" title="">the 1996 killing</a> of a store owner in Queens and of an off-duty police officer who was providing security.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Melinda Katz, the Queens district attorney, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/nyregion/queens-wrongful-convictions.html" title="">tossed out their convictions</a> in 2021, citing prosecutorial misconduct. Mr. Bolt received $15.2 million last year; Mr. Johnson received $15 million. (George Bell, among the men charged with the crimes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/nyregion/queens-murders-exonerated-settlement.html" title="">received $17.5 million in 2023</a>, the most the city has ever awarded.)</p><p>In another case, Norberto Peets, who was <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/cases/norberto-peets/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrongfully convicted of attempted murder</a> in a Bronx shooting in 1999, was awarded $14.75 million. The officers were accused of lying about what had occurred, and Mr. Peets was exonerated in 2003 after spending nearly a quarter-century in prison.</p><p>“We’re still seeing the results of the old way, the old culture of hiding evidence,” Ms. Condliffe said. “We cannot go back to that.” </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
