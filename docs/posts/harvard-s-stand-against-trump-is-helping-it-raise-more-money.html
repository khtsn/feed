Giving even more money to the world’s wealthiest school didn’t align with his values.</p><p>“Why should I be giving to this place that has billions of dollars?” he asked himself when he received fund-raising notices.</p><p>His sentiment changed this week, after the university rejected a series of demands from the Trump administration. The government asked Harvard to do a host of things — like auditing professors’ work for plagiarism and reporting international students who break rules to federal authorities — that outraged the school’s leaders, others in higher education and people far beyond its iron gates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Within hours, the federal government responded with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">$2.2 billion funding freeze</a>, and later in the week said it would try to revoke <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-irs-harvard.html" title="">Harvard’s tax-exempt status</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has said it is targeting Harvard because it has not done enough to combat antisemitism. That did not sit well with Mr. Graham-Felsen, a novelist and freelance writer in New Jersey, who is Jewish.</p><p>He gave the university a single donation of $108. It is a multiple of 18, a symbolic number in Judaism that highlighted his rejection of the idea that the federal government’s actions against Harvard were being waged in his name.</p><p>“The more Trump punishes Harvard financially,” he said, “the more I will donate. I’m not a wealthy guy.”</p><p>It is not clear how many people have donated to Harvard this week. The university did not respond to requests seeking data about donations. But Mr. Graham-Felsen said he has many friends, some of whom had never given to the institution, who sent donations this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Among some right-leaning critics, the school’s actions this week and over the past year have often prompted the opposite reaction.</p><p>A year ago, Kenneth Griffin, a hedge fund founder who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/business/harvard-upenn-hamas-israel-students-donors.html" title="">given more than</a> half a billion dollars to Harvard, said he would <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/31/ken-griffin-pausing-harvard-donations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pause donations</a> over how the school handled antisemitism.</p><p>After Harvard took its stand against President Trump this week, another vocal critic and alumnus, Shabbos Kestenbaum, expressed disappointment in his alma mater. “Harvard’s fighting Trump harder than it’s ever fought antisemitism,” Mr. Kestenbaum, who is suing the school over its handling of antisemitism, wrote on social media.</p><p>The Harvard Republican Club also <a href="https://www.harvardrepublicanclub.org/federal-funding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">derided Harvard’s response</a> to the government, saying in a statement that the university “refused to comply with federal requests to reverse ideological capture.”</p><p>Harvard has attracted resentment from all political sides in recent years.</p><p>Some believe it has reinforced a flawed meritocracy. Instead of “highly selective colleges,” critics have derided Harvard and its peers as “highly rejective colleges,” for touting their low acceptance rates as a marker of prestige.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On “The Daily Show” this week, the host, Ronny Chieng, gave Harvard credit for standing on principle and thwarting the government’s demands, but also slipped in a dig. “We’ve finally found a force more powerful than Trump’s hatred: Harvard’s love of sending rejection letters,” he said.</p><p>No one who spoke to The New York Times about donating to Harvard this week had any delusions that their small donations would meaningfully bolster the school’s finances in its multibillion-dollar battle with the government. But for many, it was no longer about Harvard.</p><p>Harvard was now a symbol.</p><p>Some more famous alumni were also inspired. Former President Barack Obama, a Harvard Law School alumnus himself, recently criticized wealthy universities for not taking a stronger posture against Mr. Trump. This week Mr. Obama, along with Senators Chuck Schumer, another alumnus, and Bernie Sanders, a former Harvard lecturer, heaped praise on the school.</p><p>Laurence Tribe, an influential Harvard emeritus professor of law, said now was the time to send donations to Harvard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Although Harvard has long drawn criticism from both the right and left, it is now a symbol of resistance to the Trump administration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“It’s a case that’s bigger than Harvard,” said Gil Pimentel, a member of the Class of 1984, who donated $100 after reading a news story about the defiant message from Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, on Monday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It’s a case of respect for the rule of law,” he added. “If the administration is allowed to bludgeon its perceived enemies without due process or respect for the rule of law, our democracy is over.”</p><p>Over the years, Mr. Pimentel has compiled an email list of about 400 members from his class, which included the former Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken; George Conway, a lawyer; and Heather Cox Richardson, a historian.</p><p>After donating, he fired off a message urging others to give, with the subject line, “Fight Fiercely, Harvard!” He noted that his donation was “the tiniest fraction of a rounding error in Harvard’s budget,” but he wanted Dr. Garber to know he had alumni support.</p><p>Mr. Pimentel said he received more than 50 responses from people saying “done” and thanking him for making the process easy (he included a link).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I got emails from people who said ‘I have never donated’ or ‘I’ve only donated once or twice and I’m donating now,’” he said.</p><p>One of the people who received his email was Mark Pelofsky, who donated $250, his first charitable gift to Harvard in many years. Mr. Pelofsky said he was “appalled” by a <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/our-resolve/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message from Dr. Garber</a> on March 31 that struck a conciliatory tone with Mr. Trump.</p><p>He wrote to Dr. Garber, saying he would “rather Harvard resist and spend every dollar in the endowment rather than comply with the administration.” He said he received an unsatisfying response.</p><p>So when Harvard changed course on Monday, he said, he wanted to register his support.</p><p>Even college leaders who have been critical of Harvard gave it some qualified support this week. Lane Glenn, the president of Northern Essex Community College, about an hour north of Harvard, has previously <a href="https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/how-harvard-could-become-a-higher-ed-hero/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> that the university should do more to help poorer colleges. His school has a $9 million endowment, in contrast to Harvard’s, which is $53 billion.</p><p>But Harvard, he said, is being treated unfairly. “It is their responsibility, with the resources that they have, to step up and defend themselves and, more broadly, the enterprise of higher education,” he said.</p><p>“Though,” he added, “I’m not opening my checkbook.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vimal Patel writes about higher education with a focus on speech and campus culture.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/harvard-university">Harvard University</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>North Dakota Libraries:</strong> State lawmakers narrowly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/north-dakota-books-obscene.html">passed a bill that would require most libraries</a> to keep material deemed explicit in areas difficult for minors to access.
