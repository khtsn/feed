In the nation’s heartland, police officers from Denver to Chicago have made dozens of arrests for alleged crimes linked to the group, from retail theft to murder and prostitution.</p><p>And in New York City, police detectives have spent months interviewing informants — including confessed gang members — to identify gang leaders and gather information on robbery patterns and recruitment efforts.</p><p>The gang in question is Tren de Aragua, which sprang from a Venezuelan prison and developed into a feared criminal organization focused on sex trafficking, human smuggling and the drug trade.</p><p>Its widening presence in the United States has become a political lightning rod for Republicans, especially former President Donald J. Trump, as they seek to blame the Biden administration’s border policy for allowing criminals into the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s accusations about the effects of migrant-fueled crime, amplified in right-wing media, are often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/us/politics/trump-border-blood-bath.html" title="">overstated or incorrect</a>. Yet the gang has nonetheless emerged as a growing source of concern for law enforcement officials, who have been scrambling to study its inner workings and track its members’ movement across the country.</p><p>Federal officials were working on more than 100 investigations linked to the gang at one point this year, according to a Department of Homeland Security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Officers nationwide have made more than 50 arrests related to the gang, the official said.</p><p>Among the places the gang has waded into is New York City, where more than 210,000 migrants have sought shelter since 2022. The city’s Police Department says the gang has primarily focused on snatching cellphones; retail thefts, especially high-end merchandise in department stores; and dealing a pink, powdery synthetic drug, known as Tusi, that is often laced with ketamine, MDMA or fentanyl.</p><p>Police detectives have sought to build a broad profile of the gang’s operations, from its recruitment tactics inside migrant shelters to its secret communications using invite-only WhatsApp groups.</p><p>One of the largest challenges, the police said, is how quickly gang members have blended into the city’s fabric, not just among asylum seekers in shelters, but also by posing as delivery drivers on mopeds, in some cases transporting firearms inside food delivery packs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The gang’s size and sophistication in the United States remain unclear, but it has some officials concerned that its members may be attempting to join forces across state lines to run larger-scale operations.</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams, who has vowed to prevent the gang from creating a stronghold in New York, sent top public safety officials to Colombia this year to <a href="https://x.com/NYPDCT/status/1823553773110722882" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open a police post</a> in Bogotá to gather information on the gang, saying that they brought back “troubling intelligence.”</p><p>“These are bad guys, and they do not represent the migrants and asylum seeker community here,” Mr. Adams, a Democrat, said in July. “This is a small number of people who are violent, and we’re going to identify them and use our practices like we use with any gang in the city.”</p><p>For Venezuelan migrants seeking asylum here, the gang’s prominence in the nation’s divisive discourse has bled into their everyday lives, creating painful stigma and discrimination.</p><p>“Any of us who have tattoos, they think that we are Tren de Aragua,” said Evelyn Velasquez, 33, a Venezuelan mother of three living in a city shelter. “I’ll go apply for a job and when they hear that we are Venezuelan, they turn us down.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h2 id="link-2ff7c8fe">Origins in a Venezuelan prison</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the Aragua prison in Venezuela, gang leaders reportedly recorded the executions and tortures of rule-breakers, circulating the videos to scare other inmates.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In one of Venezuela’s largest prisons, the police made some startling discoveries <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/09/us/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during a raid</a> last year. Aside from finding machine guns and ammo, they uncovered several restaurants, a nightclub, a swimming pool, a baseball field and a zoo.</p><p>The prison known as Tocorón in Aragua — a state southwest of Venezuela’s capital of Caracas — had been controlled by a group of prisoners who transformed the facility into <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-66873494" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a mini-city</a> where convicts roamed freely, according to experts on the gang.</p><p>The prisoners came to call themselves Tren de Aragua — which means Train of Aragua.</p><p>The gang was formed to impose order through intimidation: Leaders reportedly recorded the executions and tortures of rule-breakers, circulating the videos to scare other inmates.</p><p>The gang’s influence soon extended outside the prison until it became Venezuela’s most powerful criminal enterprise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As the country fell deep into an economic and political crisis, the gang began to profit off the millions of fleeing Venezuelans, <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-trafficking-in-persons-report/colombia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exploiting, extorting and silencing vulnerable migrants</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Aragua prison was overrun by Tren de Aragua until government authorities regained control after a raid last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“They identified there’s money to be made in immigration and they’ve taken advantage of that business,” said Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist who <a href="https://eldiario.com/2023/03/18/ronna-risquez-la-periodista-que-se-adentro-en-las-fauces-del-tren-de-aragua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a book</a> about Tren de Aragua.</p><p>The gang quickly expanded to neighboring Latin American countries. In 2022, officials in Bogotá, Colombia, accused Tren de Aragua of at least 23 murders after the police began to find <a href="https://runrun.es/noticias/483244/colombia-responsabiliza-al-tren-de-aragua-de-al-menos-23-asesinatos-cometidos-este-ano-en-bogota/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bags with body parts</a>.

It also became a target of misinformation, with Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-aurora-colorado-immigration.html" title="">falsely suggesting</a> during this month’s presidential debate that the gang had taken over Aurora, Colo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The gang’s presence in Denver and Aurora, Colo., fueled inaccurate accusations, repeated by former President Donald J.

To label someone as a member of any gang, Chief Kenny said, members often “must self-admit, say ‘I am in a gang.’ ”</p><p>“Do we think that there’s only 24 TDA members in New York City? That would be silly,” he said, referring to Tren de Aragua. “Obviously there are more.”</p><p>Violence has also erupted with a rival crew made up of former members who call themselves Anti-Tren, according to the police document. And the police have seen conflicts between Tren de Aragua and other well-established gangs, like M.S. 13 and the Latin Kings, but also alliances with others, including the Trinitaros, Chief Kenny said.</p><p>Tren de Aragua has also developed a lucrative, niche market in organized retail theft that other gangs have not, and its members often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/nyregion/nyc-restaurant-robberies.html" title="">steal phones and watches worth thousands of dollars while riding scooters</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“What’s going to become difficult for us is when they begin to really lay down roots and solidify their position as a criminal organization,” Chief Kenny said.</p><p>Some members supposedly reside or hang out at shelters in the Bronx and another by the Brooklyn Navy Yard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/nyregion/park-shooting-migrant-nyc.html" title="">where men on a moped fatally shot two migrants in July</a> in an incident that the police are investigating as gang warfare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Hall Street Shelter in Brooklyn, where two migrants were shot and killed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Arredondo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>A hot spot of gang activity also emerged on Randall’s Island, where the city is sheltering thousands of migrants in a giant tent dormitory that has been the site of several shootings and stabbings. The grounds outside the shelter are a popular gathering spot on weekends for members, who post “lookouts” to keep an eye on the police, according to one informant.</p><p>Perhaps a sign of the gang’s stealth, or its still-nascent operations, migrants living in city shelters said they had not noticed the gang’s influence there. Yet they spoke in hushed tones when Tren de Aragua was brought up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>The gang came up in casual conversations, they said, and in salacious clips on social media. But most said they could not believe the gang was actually in New York, though they expressed shame and embarrassment that all Venezuelan migrants were being associated with the group.</p><p>“I feel sometimes, as a Venezuelan, that I get a bad reputation because of certain groups that sully everyone’s name,” said Nelson, 34, who traveled to the United States with his wife and son and declined to give his last name. “I want to work, make my money and get on with my life. We aren’t all the same.”</p><p>Many echoed an oft-repeated sentiment among migrants:</p><p>“Por uno, pagan todos” — or, “For one, we all pay.”</p><p>Wesley Parnell<!-- --> and <!-- -->Hamed Aleaziz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní covers immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luis-ferre-sadurni">More about Luis Ferré-Sadurní</a></span></p></div><div><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius is a criminal justice reporter for The Times, covering the New York Police Department.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chelsia-rose-marcius">More about Chelsia Rose Marcius</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Mayor in Turmoil:</strong> As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html">federal investigations</a> swirl around Mayor Eric Adams, his political influence, his agenda and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/nyregion/eric-adams-scandal-crisis.html">his re-election effort are at risk</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Insurance Crisis Looms:</strong> The largest insurer of taxis and Ubers in New York City is insolvent.
