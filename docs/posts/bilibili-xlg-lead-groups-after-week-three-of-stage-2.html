    <h1>Bilibili, XLG lead groups after week three of Stage 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>The third week of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2499/vct-2025-china-stage-2" target="_blank">VCT China 2025 Stage 2</a> is over, with the playoff picture starting to solidify. Xi Lai Gaming is the only undefeated team left, securing their playoff spot, while Wolves squeaked past Dragon Ranger Gaming to keep their Champions Paris hopes alive.</p>

<p>Here is how the matches in week three went for Stage 2:</p>



<p>A lot of consequential games in week three, with Dragon Ranger Gaming losing two close games against both FPX and Wolves after starting Stage 2 amazingly. BLG and FPX also played two matches this past week, with the results remaining favorable, as BLG ended the week on top of their group, while FPX remains in contention for the top spot in theirs. Lastly, TEC had two matches, but were unable to win either.</p>

<p>Of all the teams in week two, Xi Lai Gaming looked the strongest as they won their only match of the week over the strong form of FPX, sweeping them to remain undefeated in Stage 2 play. Other teams that performed well in their single matches included EDG, reintroducing <span data-ref-id="12">

</span> to the team and sweeping TYLOO, as well as All Gamers winning another regional game after a long struggle. </p>

<p>There were numerous outstanding individual performances this week. First off, <span data-ref-id="13">

</span> from Wolves had a great series against the surging Dragon Ranger Gaming, as he flexed onto Duelist and helped Wolves get their first win since Masters Toronto, ending second in overall match rating with 1.35. Another amazing performer in week three was <span data-ref-id="14">

</span>, helping keep BLG atop their group with his 0.95 KPR, 1.39 K:D, and 0.20 FKPR, alongside two aces against Trace.</p>

<p>However, the best player of the week is <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/25494/shr1mp">
		Shr1mp	</a>
</span> from All Gamers, securing his team&#39;s playoff position, which is an absurd statement after over a year of no regional wins. In his close 2-1 win over Nova Esports, he ended with a 1.37 match rating, 1.50 K:D, 266.7 ACS, 169.1 ADR, and 0.98 KPR, which led all players in week three. </p>

<p>Thanks to Shr1mp and his chart-topping play in week three, AG has a chance to hop over FPX in the Group Omega standings if they win over them in week four. However, this final week of Group Stage play can determine a lot. For example, FPX, BLG, XLG, AG, and Trace Esports have already qualified for the Stage 2 playoffs thanks to their played matches and map differential, while TEC and Nova are eliminated. </p>

<p>EDG, DRG, and TYLOO are close to making it in. Wolves and JDG have a small margin to qualify, but have yet to be officially eliminated from the Stage 2 playoffs. </p>

<p>Here are the upcoming matches for week four, the final week of VCT China 2025 Stage 2:</p>
