    <h1>The Head of the I.R.S. Was Ousted</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump removed the acting head of the Internal Revenue Service, Gary Shapley, after less than a week on the job. The change was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/irs-scott-bessent-elon-musk.html" title="">prompted by a power struggle between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Elon Musk</a>. Bessent, who oversees the tax agency, had complained that Musk had persuaded the White House to appoint Shapley without his knowledge.</p><p>Bessent’s deputy, Michael Faulkender, will replace Shapley, who had only been selected for the job on Tuesday. The previous acting I.R.S. leader, Melanie Krause, resigned after the Trump administration decided to use I.R.S. data to help deport undocumented immigrants. The agency has also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/trump-irs.html" title="">under pressure from Trump</a> to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status — a push that has deeply troubled current and former officials.</p><p>The clash between Bessent and Musk escalated into a public feud last night. Musk amplified a social media post from the far-right researcher Laura Loomer, who had accused Bessent of colluding with a “Trump hater.”</p><p>Bessent is also a close adviser to the president, and his fears about the recent tariff-induced downturn in financial markets seemed to influence Trump. People close to the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/trump-powell-fed-markets.html" title="">said Trump had turned more cautious</a> on policies that could stoke extreme volatility again. They said, for example, that he has for months been aware that trying to oust Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, could cause a downturn. For now, they said, Trump seemed persuaded to hold off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with European and Ukrainian officials in Paris yesterday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Ludovic Marin</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-24b2d6ce">U.S. may abandon Ukraine talks, unless progress emerges</h2><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that the U.S. would end its efforts to strike a truce in Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/world/europe/rubio-ukraine-russia-war-paris.html" title="">if there is not meaningful progress in negotiations over the next several days</a>. “If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on,” Rubio said.</p><p>Trump, who has at times blamed Ukraine for Russia’s invasion, reiterated Rubio’s comments later in the day: “If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult,” the president said, “we’re just going to take a pass.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert F.

After he releases her hand and walks away, his fingers stretch outward like an impulsive, unconscious tic. For some fans, it’s an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/movies/pride-and-prejudice-hand-flex-joe-wright.html" title="">iconic moment known as </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/movies/pride-and-prejudice-hand-flex-joe-wright.html" title=""><em>the hand flex</em></a>.</p><p>The subtle expression of longing wasn’t meant to be a special moment, the director, Joe Wright, told us. But the hand flex has become perhaps the defining beat from Wright’s take on the novel.
