in southern Lebanon on Wednesday, as the United Nations warned that nearly a million Lebanese had fled the spreading war between Israel and Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.</p><p>In a sign of the war’s growing scale, Israeli evacuation orders now cover a quarter of Lebanon’s land area, according to the <a

which says the calls have sent people fleeing from more than a hundred villages and urban areas.</p><p>“To the people of South Lebanon: Be careful!” an Israeli military spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said on Wednesday in an Arabic language warning <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1843912445041225769" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted online</a>.

Israeli forces moved to destroy Hamas there, but when Hezbollah quickly joined the fight from the north, firing rockets into Israel, Israel found itself engaged in hostilities at another border.</p><p>Over the months that followed, the exchanges of fire displaced tens of thousands of people in Lebanon and Israel.

At least four people were killed there, in Nablus, on Wednesday in a raid by undercover Israeli forces, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry and the Israeli police.</p><p>But it is the tensions between Israel and Iran — the sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah — that have done the most in recent days to keep the region on edge. A week after Iran unleashed a barrage of missiles at Israel, its allies and adversaries alike are waiting to see what happens next.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, issue a new warning on Iran.</p><p>“Our attack will be deadly, precise and above all surprising,” he said. “Whoever attempts to hurt the State of Israel will pay the price.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>American officials, worried about an uncontrolled escalation, were caught off-guard by Israel’s recent onslaught against Hezbollah, and stymied in their efforts to broker a cease-fire both in that conflict and in the war in Gaza.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A building hit by Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fabio Bucciarelli/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Relations between the allies have been seriously strained. On Wednesday, for the first time in two months, President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel spoke by phone.</p><p>Iran has also sought to shore up relations with its Arab neighbors this week, dispatching its foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on a tour that included some of the United States’ closest partners in the region. On Wednesday, he visited one such partner: Saudi Arabia, a longtime Iranian rival.</p><p>Before Mr. Araghchi set out from Tehran, he said Iran did not want war with Israel but that it was prepared to strike back if attacked. He also said Iran would continue its support of militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, a network that calls itself the “axis of resistance.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Hezbollah has been battered by Israel’s assaults over the last three weeks, but the group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-airstrikes.html" title="">still has a formidable arsenal</a>.</p><p>A Hezbollah missile barrage on Wednesday killed two people in the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, Israel’s emergency services said. And six people were wounded by shrapnel after a rocket hit a bypass road near the northern city of Haifa, the Israeli military said.</p><p>The volley followed another night of Israeli airstrikes in the densely populated areas near Beirut where Hezbollah holds sway, and an Israeli strike near the Iranian Embassy in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Turkish citizens living in Lebanon gather as they prepare to evacuate via the Beirut port on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>More than 800 of Lebanon’s 990 shelters are <a href="https://x.com/DRM_Lebanon/status/1843686729733288063/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already full</a>, according to the government, and the few that do have room are often too remote for residents to reach, said Mr. Sullivan, the U.N. official.
