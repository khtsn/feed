    <h1>Iran Attacked Israel With Waves of Missiles</h1>

Many of the missiles were intercepted by Israel’s air defense system, while some fell in central and southern Israel, Israeli officials said. One death, of a Palestinian man in the West Bank, has so far been reported.</p><p>U.S. officials said that American naval destroyers helped Israel shoot down several incoming missiles. Based on initial reports, Israel “effectively defeated this attack,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.</p><p>The region is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/world/middleeast/israel-iran-missile-attack-april.html" title="">now on edge</a>, waiting for Israel’s next step. Israeli officials said the country would respond in a way and at a time of its choosing, and Iran said it would fire more missiles if Israel counterattacked. American officials said the U.S. would help defend Israel and warned that a direct attack would “carry severe consequences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Vance and Walz are veterans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/tim-walz-debate-history.html" title="">proven debaters</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/vance-debate-style.html" title="">quick-witted communicators</a> who talk up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/books/review/vance-walz-vp-debate-midwest.html" title="">their Midwestern roots</a>.
