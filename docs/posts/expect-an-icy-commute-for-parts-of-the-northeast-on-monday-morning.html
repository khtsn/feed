Most parts of New York and New Jersey will get less than an inch of snow starting on Sunday evening, spreading eastward into southwestern Connecticut overnight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By late Sunday night, the snow is expected to transition to freezing rain, creating hazardous, icy conditions, particularly on untreated roads and in higher elevations. The morning commute on Monday could be especially dangerous, with icy roads posing significant challenges for drivers, forecasters said.</p><p>Ice accumulations are forecast to range from a light glaze to a few hundredths of an inch across most areas, while western Orange County may get up to an inch of ice. Higher elevations in the Poconos of Pennsylvania will get the heaviest snow and ice accumulations on Sunday evening, potentially up to four inches.</p><p>Mike Kistner, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Binghamton, N.Y., said the forecast for freezing rain and ice is what pushed the Lower Hudson Valley and parts of New Jersey to be under a winter weather advisory, though the snowfall should be light.</p><p>While the cold air and below-freezing temperatures Monday morning will likely keep roads icy during the morning rush, Mr. Kistner said as it heats up later in the morning and throughout the day, conditions should clear. Bridges and overpasses may remain icy even if the main roads are wet, he added.</p><p>Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for the New York State Thruway Authority, said workers were ready to clear the roads and have pretreated them for freezing rain, though she warned drivers to take it easy on Monday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Give yourself some extra time in the morning,” Ms. Givner said. “And just slow down. I think that’s always the best way to travel in this weather.”</p><p>Winter weather advisories were <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=WVZ055&amp;warncounty=WVC031&amp;firewxzone=WVZ055&amp;local_place1=2%20Miles%20S%20Wardensville%20WV&amp;product1=Winter+Weather+Advisory&amp;lat=39.0434&amp;lon=-78.6005" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also issued</a> for areas in western Maryland, western Virginia, and eastern West Virginia, which could get up to two inches of snow and sleet.</p><p>The Weather Service warned about slippery roads in those areas. Those advisories were in place until 1 a.m. on Monday.</p><p>In West Virginia, northwestern Pocahontas County and southeastern Randolph County were <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=usa&amp;wwa=Winter%20Storm%20Warning" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under winter storm warnings</a> until 1 a.m. on Monday as strong winds, snow and ice moved in Sunday night.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
