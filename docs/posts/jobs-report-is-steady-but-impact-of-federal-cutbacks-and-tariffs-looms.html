But the swift and at times chaotic actions on tariffs, federal staffing and federal contracts have caught many businesses, small and large, off guard.</p><p>Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said Mr. Trump’s policies on trade and immigration, and his no-holds-barred approach to federal job cuts, would have a damaging effect.</p><p>“What President Trump has proposed will not cause a recession,” he said, “but it will slow economic growth.”</p><p>“It will take money out of people’s pockets,” Mr. Strain continued. “It will increase the unemployment rate. It will cost people jobs. It will make American businesses less competitive.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The federal government is the nation’s single largest employer, with about three million workers, or about 1.9 percent of the civilian work force.

Mr. Slok projects that inflation will be somewhat higher in the coming months and that overall economic growth will be a half-percentage point lower — a significant loss for the $30 trillion U.S. economy.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>If tariffs end up reigniting inflation, or even just keep it from falling further, the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates any more than it already has this cycle, even if the job market slows.</p><p>According to researchers at Bank of America, the February data “underscores the risk of mild stagflation — softer but still positive growth and modestly higher inflation — in coming months.”</p><p>Reports from business contacts at regional branches of the Federal Reserve and surveys of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/smallest-us-firms-slashed-payrolls-last-month-intuit-study-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">small businesses</a> have suggested that uncertainty prompted by the Trump administration’s rhetoric and actions may be weighing on hiring decisions in the near future.</p><p>“Headwinds are mounting,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm KPMG. “Uncertainty is paralyzing, and it is showing up everywhere”</p><p>Global business indexes that measure uncertainty have, for instance, surpassed their pandemic levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Jobs reports are inherently backward-looking snapshots. Nevertheless, evidence of a broad deterioration in U.S. economic conditions is scarce.</p><p>A collection of commentary from over 130 companies from recent earnings calls and conference presentations released by a team at Deutsche Bank showed that “on the risk of tariffs, many companies expressed a belief that while the escalations are not welcome, they would not have a dramatic impact on their businesses.”</p><p>Several executives attributed their resilient confidence to their diversified and adaptable supply chains, though that pliability may soon be further tested.</p><p>“Tensions are high, and we expect for this to play out for some time,” said Ted Krantz, chief executive of Interos, a supply chain intelligence firm whose clients include major multinational corporations.</p><p>On the domestic front, the often abstract or far-off seeming machinations of Washington politics have become painfully tangible for the families of federal workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>On Feb. 13, Margaret Woodbridge, 35, an ecologist for the National Forest Service who lives in Black Mountain, N.C., got an email from the agency, which operates under the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><p>The subject line: “Notification of Termination During Probationary Period.”</p><p>Dr. Woodbridge was shocked. She had been doing postdoctoral work for the Forest Service since 2020 and was appointed to a full-time position in early 2024.</p><p>“The agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment would be in the public interest,” her termination letter says.</p><p>“I received four performance awards in my 11 months,” said Dr. Woodbridge, whose research covers the health of southern Appalachia’s old growth forest. “My boss called and was crying.”</p><p>She follows the news closely and has heard the rationales coming from the White House for the cuts, and she even agrees that agencies like hers could be more efficient.
