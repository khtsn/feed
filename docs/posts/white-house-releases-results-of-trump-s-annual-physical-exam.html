Barbabella, who is also a Navy captain, says that Mr. Trump “remains in excellent health” and “exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health.” It refers to Mr. Trump’s “frequent victories in golf events” as an example of his “active lifestyle” contributing to his physical and mental well-being.</p><p>The report also notes that Mr. Trump has been treated for high cholesterol, skin damages from frequent sun exposure, seasonal allergies and diverticulosis, a condition in which small pouches, called diverticula, form in the wall of the colon. He has also had cataract surgery for both of his eyes and has had a benign colon polyp, according to the report.</p><p>Mr. Trump, 78, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/politics/trump-physical.html" title="">underwent cognitive and cardiology</a> tests during a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland on Friday. He told reporters he felt he was in “good shape” and had a “good heart.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/13/us/1.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/53904844cb92151e/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/13/us/1.html"><h2>Read the Report on President Trump&#39;s Annual Physical Exam</h2></a><p>The White House released the results of President Trump’s annual physical examination on Sunday.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/13/us/1.html"><strong>Read Document</strong> 3 pages</a></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The health report states that Mr. Trump has gone through “a comprehensive neurological examination” that revealed no abnormalities in cognitive function or his mental state. It says he scored 30 out of 30 points for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test for mental capacity in which subjects are asked to do <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/montreal-cognitive-assessment" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simple tasks</a> such as draw a clock that marks a certain time or repeat sentences that are read to them. A score of 25 or less is indicative of cognitive impairment.</p><p>It also lays out detailed laboratory test results for cholesterol — saying his cholesterol levels were within a normal range — and blood count levels, which his report from 2023 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/us/politics/trump-medical-report.html" title="">did not include</a>. It is unclear whether the White House would make Dr. Barbabella available to answer questions as Mr. Trump has done with his physicians in the past.</p><p>The report is the first public accounting of Mr. Trump’s health since he returned to office in January and became the oldest man ever sworn in as president. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/health/trump-health-records.html" title="">had been guarded about even basic medical information</a> since he was shot in an assassination attempt in July.</p><p>His past medical reports have been met with skepticism. One of his personal physicians said in 2018 that Mr. Trump had personally dictated a note, released under that doctor’s name three years earlier, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/nyregion/harold-bornstein-dead.html" title="">described Mr. Trump’s blood pressure</a> as “astonishingly excellent.” The note said Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, would be the “healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Also in 2018, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, then the White House physician, wrote that Mr. Trump was in “excellent” cardiac health despite Mr. Trump having a high LDL cholesterol level of 143. (The report released Sunday listed his LDL level at 51.) Cardiologists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/us/politics/trump-physical-heart-health-cholesterol.html" title="">unaffiliated with the White House</a> said at the time that Mr. Trump’s physical examination had revealed serious health concerns and had indicated that Mr. Trump was at risk of a heart attack.</p><p>In 2020, Dr. Sean P. Conley, another White House physician, admitted that he had misled the public about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/04/us/politics/trump-doctor-conley.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s case</a> of Covid-19 in an effort to reflect the White House’s “upbeat attitude” about the president’s condition.</p><p>Mr. Trump, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/trump-mcdonalds-fries.html" title="">fast-food enthusiast,</a> is fueled by a diet heavy on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/trump-health-physical.html" title="">ice cream, red meat</a> and soda.</p><p>The president has referred to himself as “very much of a germaphobe” and says he does not drink alcohol or smoke, which was noted in the report. He has said he sleeps about five hours a night. Medical reports have described him as standing 6-foot-3.</p><p>The report on Sunday lists him at 224 pounds, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/us/politics/trump-mugshot-booking-photo.html" title="">nine pounds heavier than his records from the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta</a> in 2023, when he was charged with attempts to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat in Georgia.</p><p>Presidents are not required to release their medical records, but they traditionally have done so to show the American public they are up to the demands of their job.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was 82 years old when he left office, and was plagued by concerns about his age during his bid for re-election. Mr. Biden dropped out of the race in July.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Minho Kim covers breaking news and climate change for The Times.
