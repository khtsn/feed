    <h1>A Judge Upheld Trump’s Felony Conviction, but Signaled No Jail Time</h1>

The judge also signaled that he was inclined to spare the president-elect any punishment.</p><p>The judge, Juan Merchan, indicated that he favored a so-called unconditional discharge of Trump’s sentence, a rare and lenient alternative to jail or probation. He set a sentencing date of Jan. 10, rebuffing Trump’s request to overturn the jury’s verdict.</p><p>An unconditional discharge would cement Trump’s status as a felon just before his inauguration on Jan. 20 even as it would water down the consequences for his crimes. Trump would be the first to carry that designation into the Oval Office.</p><p>Trump is now expected to ask an appeals court to intervene and postpone the sentencing. A Manhattan jury convicted him in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records, concluding that he had sought to cover up a sex scandal that threatened to derail his 2016 campaign for president. He faced up to four years in prison in the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-436fc967">Mike Johnson was re-elected as House speaker</h2><p>Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/03/us/house-speaker-vote-johnson-trump" title="">was re-elected this afternoon to the House’s top leadership post</a>.</p><p>Three right-wing Republicans, and every Democrat, initially opposed Johnson. Eventually, after huddling with Johnson, two of the three Republican holdouts agreed to support his candidacy. The fairly swift acquiesce was a major victory for Johnson, and Donald Trump, but it previewed challenges that Republicans could face with such<span>  </span>a narrow majority in the House.</p><p>“Getting elected speaker was probably the easiest part,” our congressional corespondent Catie Edmondson told me, adding that the chaotic vote forecasts difficult times ahead for Johnson. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5ecefd5c">The surgeon general called for cancer warnings on alcohol</h2><p>The U.S. surgeon general released a report today urging Congress to require alcoholic beverages be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/health/alcohol-surgeon-general-warning.html" title="">affixed with labels warning drinkers of cancer risks</a>, similar to those on packs of cigarettes. He pointed to a growing body of research that has linked drinking, sometimes even within the recommended limits, to various types of cancer.</p><p>The move was the latest salvo in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/health/alcohol-dietary-guidelines.html" title="">a fierce debate about the risks and benefits of moderate drinking</a> as the influential Dietary Guidelines for Americans are about to be updated. For decades, moderate drinking was linked to fewer heart attacks and strokes. But alcohol directly contributes to 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 related deaths each year, the surgeon general said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters against President Yoon Suk Yeol near his residence in Seoul today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.
