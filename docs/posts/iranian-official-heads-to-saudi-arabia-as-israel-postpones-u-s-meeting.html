But on Tuesday the visit was postponed, and the Israeli prime minister’s office has declined to say why.</p><p>The fate of the two visits highlighted the complicated regional dynamics the Biden administration must navigate as it seeks to calm the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and prevent the outbreak of a third, between Israel and Iran.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/world/middleeast/gallant-austin-washington-visit-postponed.html" title="">postponement of Mr. Gallant’s trip to Washington</a> comes amid heightened tensions between President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel’s conduct of its wars in Gaza and Lebanon and discussions between the two governments about how Israel should retaliate for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/iran-missile-attack-israel-war.html" title="">Iran’s missile barrage last week</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Since the war in Gaza began a year ago with a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel, Mr. Biden has repeatedly vowed to support Israel while also working to broker cease-fires and steer Israel away from moves that the United States fears could cause more civilian deaths and suffering — or increase the chances of violence spreading to the broader region.</p><p>But Israel’s leaders have often overridden the White House’s guidance and have recently escalated their military offensives, striking Hezbollah in Lebanon, assassinating many of its leaders and sending ground troops into the country’s south.</p><p>More recently, discussions between the United States and Israel have focused on Israel’s response to Iran’s firing of roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">180 ballistic missiles at Israel</a> last Tuesday in response to the Israeli assassinations of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, two of Iran’s proxy forces in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, is scheduled to arrive in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday as part of a diplomatic tour aimed at preventing further escalation in the region’s wars.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohamed Azakir/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Gallant had been expected in Washington on Wednesday to discuss Israel’s planning with Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

He did not call Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p>The expected visit by Mr. Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister, to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday showcased a more neutral approach to the region’s troubles among Gulf Arab nations, some of the United States’ other closest partners in the Middle East.</p><p>In Riyadh, the Saudi capital, Mr. Araghchi was expected to meet with the Saudi foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan. Iran’s ISNA news agency reported that Mr. Araghchi’s regional tour sought to end “Israeli crimes” in Gaza and Lebanon. He met with top Lebanese officials in Beirut on Friday and President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus on Saturday.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran have a long history of bitter rivalry but reached <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/11/us/politics/saudi-arabia-iran-china-biden.html" title="">a new accord</a> in March 2023 that reduced tensions in the Persian Gulf and opened the door to high-level diplomatic contacts like Wednesday’s meeting.</p><p>Senior officials from other close U.S. allies, including Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates — both of which also recently established diplomatic relations with Israel — have also maintained contact or attended events with Iranian leaders recently, making it clear that they do not plan to take sides in a direct conflict between Israel and Iran.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israel’s Invasion of Lebanon:</strong><strong> </strong>A diplomatic push to avert a broader war in Lebanon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-talks.html">fell apart after Israel killed Hezbollah’s leader</a>.
