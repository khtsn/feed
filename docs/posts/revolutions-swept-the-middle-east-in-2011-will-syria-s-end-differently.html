in 2011 to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, they were part of a cascade of revolutions, known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/11/magazine/isis-middle-east-arab-spring-fractured-lands.html" title="">Arab Spring</a>, that aimed to oust authoritarian leaders across the Middle East.</p><p>While opposition groups elsewhere experienced swift success, the Syrian revolution devolved into a 13-year civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands, displaced millions and carved the country into competing fiefs.</p><p>Mr. al-Assad’s stunning fall finally allows Syrians to feel the joy that their counterparts experienced more than a decade ago in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen — the four Arab countries where dictators were toppled far more quickly.</p><p>Yet while those four states provided a template for revolutionary success, their trajectories since the Arab Spring also constitute a warning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Egypt and Tunisia, new strongmen eventually rose to power, crushing efforts to build pluralist democracies. In Libya and Yemen, rival militias jockeyed for control, leading to civil war and the partition of both countries.</p><p>“The people who have survived the last 13 years deserve to enjoy the moment before they worry about the future,” said Alistair Burt, a former minister in the British government who helped spearhead its Mideast policy during the Arab Spring.</p><p>“At the same time, we all know the experience of the region since 2011,” Mr. Burt said. “We want to hope for the best but we prepare for something worse.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrians celebrated early Sunday in the main square of Homs, Syria.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aref Tammawi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The dynamics in Syria make for a particularly fraught transition of power. The Islamist rebel alliance that led the rapid advance on Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is one of several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">rival opposition groups</a> that must now agree on how to run Syria in the post-Assad era.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is now the most influential group in Syria, it is competing for influence with another Turkey-backed group based in northern Syria, as well as a secular Kurdish-led alliance in eastern Syria that is supported by the United States. And southern Syria is dominated by local rebel groups, including militias led by the Druse minority, an offshoot of Islam.</p><p>Once affiliated with Al Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has tried to present itself as a moderate movement that seeks to preserve the rights of Syria’s many minorities, including its Christians, Druse and Alawites, the Shiite sect that formed Mr. al-Assad’s base.</p><p>Unless the group, which the United States has designated as a terrorist organization, makes good on that promise, analysts say, it could end up prolonging the civil war: Militias from different minorities may feel obliged to defend their areas from the new central government.</p><p>“You can’t tell people that they’re safe: They have to believe it,” said Mr. Burt. “That’s why the conduct of H.T.S. — and all those with guns at the moment in the liberated cities — is so important.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crowd in Damascus on Sunday surrounded Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, center, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which seized the city on Sunday.

They could yet prove decisive in any new power play, as their counterparts did in the countries where leaders were toppled in 2011-12.</p><p>After the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html" title="">fall of Hosni Mubarak</a> in Egypt in 2011, the military leadership still controlled the pace of the political transition. After allowing elections, the military later took back power in a popular coup in 2013, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/world/middleeast/egypt.html" title="">ousting Mohamed Morsi</a>, Egypt’s first freely elected president. Mr. Morsi, an Islamist, had himself angered many Egyptians through heavy-handed governance, leading some to lose faith in the democratic process.</p><p>Elections were also held in Libya after the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, but the country has been partitioned since civil war <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/world/africa/libyan-strongman-battles-militias-for-control.html" title="">broke out three years later</a>.</p><p>In Yemen, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/world/middleeast/yemen-votes-to-remove-ali-abdullah-saleh.html" title="">departure</a> of Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2012 was also followed by a civil war, which allowed the Houthis, an Iran-backed movement, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/world/middleeast/swift-ascent-of-houthis-in-yemen-brings-relief-and-trepidation.html" title="">seize the capital</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>For years, Tunisia was the most successful of the Arab Spring countries, holding several elections after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/world/africa/15tunis.html" title="">downfall of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali</a>.

Mr. al-Assad’s forces dropped thousands of barrel bombs on his own citizens and gassed some of them with chemical weapons.</p><p>His refusal to relinquish power in 2011 led to a bloody civil war that displaced millions of people, destroyed much of the country and led to the rise of terrorist groups like ISIS.</p><p>“No matter what comes next, it won’t be worse than Bashar al-Assad’s regime,” said Hashem Alsouki, a Syrian former civil servant detained and tortured early in the war who later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jun/09/a-migrants-journey-from-syria-to-sweden-interactive" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sought safety with his family in Europe</a>.</p><p>“Yes, there is concern for the future,” Mr. Alsouki added in a telephone interview. “At the same time, I have faith that we will overcome this stage.
