The pilot, the captain that was maneuvering the ship, lost, I guess, power of the ship in the current. A mechanical function caused the ship to go right into the pillar of the bridge, hitting the masts of the ship where there was a couple of sailors on top of it. These sailors were injured as a result of the masts striking the bridge.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/18/multimedia/18vid-brooklyn-bridge-mexico-ship-crash-mhvw/18vid-brooklyn-bridge-mexico-ship-crash-mhvw-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">There were 277 people on board when the ship drifted directly into the underside of the bridge on Saturday night, the authorities said.

Its masts appeared to be badly damaged.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At a news conference on Saturday, the authorities said the pilot who was assigned to navigate the Cuauhtémoc out of the channel had encountered “mechanical issues.” The National Transportation Safety Board will be doing a full investigation of the crash.</p><p>The commander of the Mexican Navy, Adm. Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles,<strong> </strong>said in a statement on Sunday that the uninjured cadets would continue their training and that the investigation into the crash would be carried out “with total transparency and responsibility.”</p><p>“We know that every sailing trip involves risks inherent to our seafaring vocation,” said Admiral Morales Ángeles.</p><p>Nick Corso, 23, was finishing dinner with friends at a restaurant nearby when they saw the ship heading toward them.</p><p>He thought at first that the vessel would clear the bridge, he said, but then “the top lights on the mast disappeared behind the bridge and I was like, Oh, it’s not going to make it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>When the top of a mast hit the underside of the bridge, he said, “you could hear it snap.”</p><p>At Pier 16, where the injured were brought, a large crowd gathered by the waterfront, and emergency vehicles with lights flashing filled South Street. Periodically, emergency workers wheeled victims with neck braces on toward ambulances and loaded them in on gurneys. Whenever a new survivor appeared, the crowd broke into cheers and applause and chanted: “Mex-i-co! Mex-i-co!”</p><p>One woman with her head bandaged was pushed out on a gurney. She was weeping. Beside her walked two companions in white slacks and striped black-and-white tops. One had her left arm in a sling. The other had her head wrapped in white gauze.</p><p>One man’s nose and uniform were smeared in dark blood, and his chin was bandaged.</p><p>Not long after that, a man was wheeled out on a gurney. He gave a thumbs-up when he passed the crowd.</p><p>Octavio Muniz, 44, said he had come from his home in Newark to see the ship because he is from Mexico.</p><p>Mr. Muniz said he had watched in horror as the masts toppled.

He said the city’s priority was to “take care” of a group of people on the ship he called “good soldiers.”</p><p>Asked how long the ship would stay docked in New York, he said, “As long as necessary.”</p><p>A Mexican Navy official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give interviews said on Sunday that the Cuauhtémoc would go through an inspection process and that the ship’s fate would not be determined until a technical report was available. </p><p>The ship — a steel-hulled, three-masted barque, about 300 feet long — was built in Bilbao, Spain, in 1981 and then acquired by the Mexican government the following year to use as a training ship at its Heroic Naval Military School. Last year it won the Boston Teapot Trophy, an annual international award given to the sail training vessel that covers the greatest distance within five days.</p><p>At Pier 36 on Sunday morning, the regal ship, with its green trimmed hull and gilded masts, sat in the East River, a firm breeze rocking its disabled mast. Just before 10 a.m., a group of wounded sailors, including a man in an arm sling and another with his head bandaged in white gauze, emerged from the back of a white transport van to board once again. Bystanders tried to catch glimpses of the ship from behind police barricades.</p><p>Roque Anaya, 42, had traveled with his family from Rhode Island to New York City on Friday to see the ship he had learned about in school as a child in Hidalgo, Mexico. He had boarded for a tour, snapped photos with his family and spoken with the mariners making the voyage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The Anaya family returned to the site of the crash on Sunday to check on the ship’s status.</p><p>“It’s a little heartbreaking,” said Jessica Anaya, his daughter, while holding back tears. “We came for this.”</p><p>“A lot of things are going through my mind right now: Will it stay here, will it go back to Mexico,” said Mr. Anaya. “They’ll have to fix it.”</p><p>The Mexican Navy said in a statement that the Cuauhtémoc had set sail on April 6 from Acapulco on a mission with the goal of “exalting the seafaring spirit, strengthening naval education and carrying the Mexican people’s message of peace and good will to the seas and ports of the world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The damaged vessel, docked at sunrise on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The vessel docked at Pier 36 after midnight.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>The vessel had planned to spend 254 days away making calls in New York; Kingston, Jamaica; Havana; Reykjavik, Iceland; Aberdeen, Scotland; Avilés, Spain; Bridgetown, Barbados; and London.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The tour stopped abruptly in New York, where the authorities promised an investigation into the episode. Government <a href="https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/files/cp2/CPB2_C09_WEB.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">infrastructure documents</a> show the bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet. The Cuauhtémoc’s masts were roughly 160 feet tall.</p><p>After the crash, all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were briefly closed in both directions, the city’s <a href="https://x.com/NotifyNYC/status/1923923134618406926" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emergency management notification system</a> reported. Ydanis Rodriguez, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, said that the span was being inspected, but it appeared as though “there was not any major damage to the bridge.”</p><p>The Brooklyn Bridge, which took 14 years to build, was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/nyregion/brooklyn-bridge-140-years.html" title="">city’s first suspension bridge</a>. Since its construction over 140 years ago, the monolithic connector has become a quintessential part of New York City, tying together Brooklyn to Manhattan. It is as recognizable a symbol of New York as the Empire State Building.</p><p>This is not the first tall ship to strike the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>In 1921, for instance, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1921/02/04/archives/ship-bends-mast-on-brooklyn-bridge.html" title="">steel mainmast</a> of the six-masted schooner Edward J. Lawrence struck the bridge as the ship was being towed beneath the central span. More than a decade later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1935/10/03/archives/masts-of-freighter-hit-brooklyn-bridge-captain-of-german-vessel.html" title="">a freighter</a> struck a steel girder on the bridge, damaging three of the ship’s four masts. The captain blamed what he characterized as an abnormally high tide. In 1986, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/11/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-scraping-by.html" title="">520-foot freighter</a> from South Korea scraped the underside of the bridge, destroying one of the ship’s radars.</p><p>Nate Schweber<!-- --> <!-- -->James Wagner<!-- -->, <!-- -->Sean Piccoli<!-- -->, <!-- -->Cassidy Jensen<!-- -->, <!-- -->Adeel Hassan<!-- -->, <!-- -->Yan Zhuang<!-- -->, <!-- -->Wesley Parnell<!-- --> and <!-- -->Amelia Nierenberg<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joseph Goldstein covers health care in New York for The Times, following years of criminal justice and police reporting.</p></div><div><p>Shayla Colon is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p></div><div><p>Andrew Keh covers New York City and the surrounding region for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
