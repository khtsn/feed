Step by grueling step, they teetered along the edge of a cracked highway, entire stretches of which had fallen into the creek below. They leaped from rock to rock to avoid sinking into thick mud that had fallen from the mountainside. They helped each other up and down ledges and over fallen trees and power lines.</p><p>Finally, after climbing 500 feet in elevation, Ms. Ladlee, 22, reunited with her parents and younger brother for the first time since the remnants of Hurricane Helene inundated western North Carolina and killed more than 90 in the state. They embraced tearfully, as if they had been through a battle and survived.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/us/02NAT-NC-TOWN-05/02NAT-NC-TOWN-05-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/us/02NAT-NC-TOWN-05/02NAT-NC-TOWN-05-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/us/02NAT-NC-TOWN-05/02NAT-NC-TOWN-05-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Ms. Ladlee stands and rests her head on a hiking stick.

Places like the tiny town of Bat Cave, N.C., where Ms. Ladlee and her fiancé live, and nearby Gerton, where her parents live, had no way to prepare for the historic deluge, and many are now cut off from the outside world.</p><p>Just to get into Bat Cave on Tuesday, one had to either float across the Broad River in a raft or walk across a wobbly plank that had been placed over broken portions of a bridge. There is no way for cars to get in; food and water have been dropped off by helicopters or carried over the river on foot or by a raft.</p><p>Ms. Ladlee’s fiancé, Anthony Norwood, 26, grew up nearby and said it has been difficult, since the storm, to find out what is happening in other places. Turning on the radio the other night, he found it surreal to hear a sportscast. Spending all day navigating his devastated town makes it hard to imagine that things are normal elsewhere, he said.</p><p>“From here, you can’t tell that the world’s going on,” he said.</p><p>As isolated as the couple is, it is even worse for Ms. Ladlee’s parents, who are stranded up the mountain with myriad obstacles blocking their path down. They have been cooking food over a fire, showering in a nearby waterfall and plotting how to get out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Ladlee and Mr. Norwood’s journey up the mountain normally would have taken about five minutes by car.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Ladlee and Mr. Norwood on their hike.

In the days after, they had hoped a helicopter would be able to pick them up near their home, but now they are resigned to trying to trek down the mountain later this week.</p><p>“We’re surviving off of what we have,” said Heidi Ladlee, 46, who runs a candle and crafts store in the nearby town of Chimney Rock.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Nobody expected this,” she added. “That’s why everyone’s stuck.”</p><p>Bat Cave — named for a cave nearby that is home to endangered bats — is an unincorporated community about 20 miles southeast of Asheville. Pictures and logos of bats adorn license plates, houses and a water truck at the firehouse. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A makeshift helicopter landing pad.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tammy Selvig pours boiled water into a container in the Bat Cave volunteer fire station.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The firehouse has become the central meeting point for those who remain in town, whether by choice or necessity. There is a kitchen where people can cook meals, cots where they can rest and stacks of food and water. An orange “H” spray-painted on a nearby bridge marks a makeshift helicopter landing pad.</p><p>Clayton Freeman, the lieutenant of the volunteer fire department in Bat Cave, has been at the firehouse for days, coordinating helicopter drop-offs and other operations. He said the most help was coming from individuals who were flying their own helicopters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In normal times, the area is popular with tourists lured by the breathtaking mountain views, scenic hikes and a wealth of short-term rentals. There is a cider mill that sells freshly pressed juice and an antique shop next to a small post office. But a special bond exists among the small number of people who live in Bat Cave all year.</p><p>Among them are Chelsea Atkins and her husband, Andy Wells, who live across from the post office and took refuge there last Thursday until it, too, began filling with water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Local residents use a raft to bring in supplies to Bat Cave.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A home near the Broad River is destroyed by floodwaters.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“It got knee-deep in under a minute,” Ms. Atkins said. They ran to their cars with their belongings in trash bags and fled up the mountain with their kitten and dog. They did not have time to find their other cat, who had swum out the door.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>They found safety on an empty cabin’s screened-in porch and watched an avalanche of water and mud take out house after house on Friday morning.</p><p>“You were just standing there watching the river and you could hear ‘Bam! Bam! Bam!’ one after the other,” Ms. Atkins said. “It was like dominoes.”</p><p>Their own home, a cozy red structure with a slanted roof that sits along the river, was filled with mud, and one of its walls was torn apart by a large tree.</p><p>For two days, Ms. Atkins was stuck in town with no phone service. Her family feared that she had died. This week, she was packing up what belongings she could find and wondering what would come of the town she had fallen in love with when she moved there in 2017.</p><p>“I don’t want to live anywhere else,” Ms. Atkins said. “I might be delusional to think that we can come back here, but the minute they say it’s OK, I’ll be here.”</p><p>Isabelle Taft<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national stories across the United States with a focus on criminal justice.
