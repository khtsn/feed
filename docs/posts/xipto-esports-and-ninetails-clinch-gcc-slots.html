</a> with their only losses coming to Team Falcons Vega. </p>

<p>Under the Xipto banner, the team continued to be one of the strongest in Southeast Asia in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2473/game-changers-2025-southeast-asia-split-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Split 2</a>, but still could not get over the Team Falcons Vega hurdle. They finished second, claiming one of the region&#39;s three <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2548/game-changers-2025-pacific/main-event" target="_blank">GC Pacific</a> slots, with their only two losses of the split coming to Team Falcons. On the Pacific stage in Bangkok, Xipto finally exorcised those demons, defeating Team Falcons to reach the upper final. From there, they defeated Ninetails 2-0 to clinch a top-two finish and qualify for the Game Changers Championship.</p>

<p>Ninetails burst onto the scene in 2025. The team was <a href="https://youtu.be/laX6ZuyjSIY?si=mMPp_LFVBtreeZir" target="_blank">founded</a> by streamer <span data-ref-id="11">

</span>. With one rookie and four players who have had GC experience in Korea and Japan, the team opened up play in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2438/game-changers-2025-korea-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Korea Stage 1</a> in dominant fashion, winning all three of their open qualifier matches 2-0 before going 8-0, dropping just two maps over the course of the entire stage. That dominance continued in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2493/game-changers-2025-korea-split-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Split 2</a>, as the team again went a perfect 8-0, dropping just one map this time en route to qualifying for Game Changers Pacific.</p>

<p>After winning their first two matches, Ninetails&#39; 21-match winning streak was snapped by Xipto in the upper finals, sending them to the lower bracket, where a matchup against the old Xipto core of Team Falcons Vega awaited them. In a best-of-five series that went the distance, Sentinel player <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/30315/fullmoon">
		FullMoon	</a>
</span> logged a match-high 96 kills to help Ninetails defeat Team Falcons Vega, making Ninetails Korea&#39;s first-ever participant in a Game Changers Championship.</p>

<p>Both teams secured their GCC slots, and in the grand final, Xipto took advantage of its double map ban to claim victory in the rematch. They banned away Ascent and Lotus, two of their more frequent bans in recent months, and won 3-1 to claim back-to-back Pacific GC titles. Xipto Duelist <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/52180/yxqme">

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/45029/grahams">
		grahams	</a>
</span> finished with the highest rating of all players with 1.33. </p>

<p>The Game Changers Championship will be held in Seoul, South Korea, from November 20-30. Four out of the competition&#39;s 10 slots have already been claimed, with Xipto and Ninetails joined by <span data-ref-id="16">
