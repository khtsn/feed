    <h1>Musk’s $1 Million Offer Raises New Legal Questions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since introducing the petition earlier this month, Mr. Musk has gradually been increasing the financial payout to encourage people to sign it. Mr. Musk initially offered people who refer signers $47 per referral. Then, he increased the offer to $100, and said he would pay both the signatory and the referrer directly.</p><p>Some election lawyers suggested that Mr. Musk was inching closer to the legal line. On Saturday night at a town hall in Harrisburg, Pa., Mr. Musk offered his first $1 million payment, awarding an oversized check to a voter, John Dreher, whom he called onstage.</p><p>Brendan Fischer, a campaign-finance lawyer and advocate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/elon-musk-47-dollars-petition.html" title="">who told The Times</a> two weeks ago that he thought the first iteration of the idea — the $47-per-referral structure — was in bounds, said he was slowly growing alarmed.</p><p>“I thought the initial arrangement was lawful because the PAC was just paying one person who referred another person to sign a petition that itself made no reference to registration or voting. The latest version of this plan comes much closer to the legal line,” he said. “There would be few doubts about the legality if every Pennsylvania-based petition signer were eligible, but conditioning the payments on registration arguably violates the law, which prohibits giving anything of value to induce or reward a person for registering to vote.”</p><p>Mr. Musk’s super PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk has surrounded himself with a group of executives, friends and political experts that his team thinks give him an innovative view of how to approach mundane tasks like voter registration, which can be pretty expensive on a per-voter basis, no matter how it is done.</p></div></div>
