    <h1>As Black Voters Hesitate on Harris, Democrats Race to Win Them Over</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In Atlanta, a group of Black entertainers and elected officials took the stage at a brewery to urge a crowd of Black men to support Vice President Kamala Harris. In Milwaukee, dozens of volunteers fanned out across Black neighborhoods to encourage sometimes skeptical residents to vote. And in a blitz of national media interviews and campaign ads, Ms. Harris herself made her case to Black voters.</p><p>The flood of recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/harris-policies-black-men.html" title="">door-knocking, ads, rallies and celebrity-studded outreach events</a> across battleground states reflects Democrats’ growing alarm about their weakening support among Black voters — a yearslong drift that the party’s leaders have not confronted so directly, and with the stakes so high, until now.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html" title="">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> last week found that Ms. Harris was underperforming President Biden’s support with Black voters in 2020 by roughly 10 percentage points, and by 15 points among Black men — a drop-off that could doom her fortunes. The poll found that former President Donald J. Trump was making inroads, with 15 percent of Black voters saying they would back him.</p><p>Interviews with more than three dozen Black voters, strategists and elected officials offered a complicated picture of a politically powerful group of Americans whose waning devotion to the Democratic Party stems partly from a feeling that their decades of loyalty has delivered little in return. The party now finds itself in the unfamiliar position of needing to treat Black Americans as voters who must be persuaded to support them, rather than unflinching supporters who will back liberal candidates without a second thought.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Young Black men in particular say they feel disillusioned by the political system and do not see how Ms. Harris’s policies could help them. Their apathy and frustration with Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/black-men-election-georgia-trump-harris.html" title="">have provided an opening for Mr. Trump</a>.</p><p>Ms. Harris has just a few weeks left to persuade hesitant Black voters that she is the candidate who can bring the change many say they are waiting for, and to give some of them a reason to vote at all.</p><p>“People were so tired of the negative, we went to the space for joy, excitement and happiness — and that has its place,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of the voting rights group Black Voters Matter. “At this phase, it’s take your gloves off.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="People standing around and talking at a Democratic field office in Milwaukee, with campaign signs for Kamala Harris hanging around the room." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volunteers gathered at a Democratic field office on Saturday in Milwaukee before a canvassing event.

The town-hall event included local Democratic officials as well as the producers Jermaine Dupri and Isaac Hayes III.</p><p>Onstage, Dontaye Carter, the chair of the North Fulton Democratic Party, unfolded a printed page of Ms. Harris’s policies. Listing her proposals to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/trump-harris-child-tax-credit.html" title="">reintroduce and expand the child tax credit</a> and offer down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers, he argued that Ms. Harris would deliver for Black Americans.</p><p>“She ain’t got ‘Black’ listed on there, but if you take the time to read through those policies — that’s us. That’s our community,” he said, later asking: “What is Trump bringing us?”</p><p>Much of Black voters’ openness to supporting Mr. Trump, the men argued, stemmed from a concerted disinformation effort. Some younger Black voters, for example, mistakenly believe that Mr. Trump has promised more of the stimulus checks that he signed during the coronavirus pandemic. Another false claim contends that as California’s attorney general, Ms. Harris went out of her way to prosecute Black men and allowed the state’s immigrants to take their jobs.</p><p>Allies of Ms. Harris see a dire need to counter this messaging.</p><p>“I think sometimes folks have short memories, but we have to remember who it is that we’re dealing with,” said Cavalier Johnson, the Democratic mayor of Milwaukee. Mr. Trump, he said, would enact policies that “make life harder for Black people, generally, in this country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Monday, Ms. Harris’s campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/harris-policies-black-men.html" title="">released a policy agenda</a> targeted heavily at Black men. The plan includes forgiving a portion of small-business loans; supporting mentorship and apprenticeship programs; and a program that would help stem health inequities for Black men.</p><p>In part, the measures offered something of a rebuttal to criticisms that the Democratic Party has neglected Black men.</p><p>“While Vice President Harris is promising to equip Black men with the tools needed to pursue our dreams and aspirations,” said Cedric Richmond, a Harris campaign co-chair, “Donald Trump is promising Black America a national nightmare.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I think sometimes folks have short memories, but we have to remember who it is that we’re dealing with,” said Cavalier Johnson, the Democratic mayor of Milwaukee.

But she is supporting Mr. Trump.</p><p>“I had more money in my pocket when he was president,” she said. Since then, inflation has eaten into her income. “It was costing a lot to put gas in my tank.”</p><p>Many Black men, in particular, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7685333/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20in%20the%20third,and%20Asian%20groups%20%5B36%5D." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggled with job losses during the pandemic</a> and with the rising cost of living since then. Republicans have pointed to higher prices to criticize Ms. Harris, who they say could have helped push through economic policies to aid Black workers.</p><p>Still, some Black men remain on the fence, or are leaning toward Ms. Harris.</p><p>In Philadelphia, the heavily Black Democratic stronghold of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/trump-harris-pennsylvania-battleground.html" title="">a top battleground state</a>, Robert Simuel, 34, said he was still making up his mind after voting for Barack Obama twice and for Mr. Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p><p>This time, Mr. Simuel, a supervisor for a food service company, said he was frustrated with Mr. Trump’s lack of policy specifics, especially as his rent rises and he struggles to save up to buy a home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As part of what she calls an economic “opportunity agenda,” Ms. Harris has proposed to cap rent increases and provide up to $25,000 for first-time home buyers.</p><p>Though Mr. Simuel is skeptical about Ms. Harris’s plans for the economy, he said, she may have his vote because of abortion rights.</p><p>“She’s trying to put those rights back into women’s hands,” he said.</p><p>Watching his grandson play football on Saturday in Lincoln Park in Milwaukee, Kenneth Bennett, 62, explained his reluctance to support Ms. Harris. He said he had spent years trying to put his life back together after a decades-old felony drug conviction, but still found it difficult to find safe housing.</p><p>He said he was not sure if she would take matters like immigration and the economy seriously enough.</p><p>“I just don’t like it when she’s grinning about the border and all that,” he said. Still, he would rather vote for her than Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“He’s a felon and he’s going to be a felon,” said Mr. Bennett, whose right to vote was restored years after he completed his sentence. “I’m a felon and I can’t even get an apartment.”</p><p>As he spoke, a volunteer and a Harris campaign organizer approached several people around him, asking about their political leanings and logging the answers into an app called Reach.</p><p>The Biden campaign <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/06/biden-volunteers-campaign-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">piloted Reach</a> in Milwaukee County as it tried to reach voters through their social networks. Users can share content about Ms. Harris’s campaign with friends and family members, an effort that campaign officials hope will combat misinformation and gin up excitement.</p><p>“We do that because we want to touch voters at all points,” Mayor Johnson said. “And we’ve been able to touch, in our county, over 30,000 people using that relational organizing strategy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kenneth Bennett, 62, said he was not sure if Ms. Harris would take matters like immigration and the economy seriously enough. “I just don’t like it when she’s grinning about the border and all that,” he said.

Last week, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/obama-harris-pittsburgh-democrats.html" title="">admonished skeptical Black men</a>, saying they were “coming up with all these reasons and excuses” to oppose her, many of them driven by sexism. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But for people like Al McBride, 47, of Pittsburgh, the entreaties are too little, too late.</p><p>He recalled casting just one vote in his life — for Mr. Obama in 2008. He said he did not plan to vote again.</p><p>Sixteen years after Mr. Obama took office, Mr. McBride said, “We still in the same place.”</p><p>Ms. Harris’s campaign has aimed to convey empathy in its messaging to Black men who feel left out of the political process, and in recent days she has spoken more directly to Black voters.</p><p>On Monday, she appeared in interviews with the independent Black journalist Roland Martin and with The Shade Room, a digital entertainment publication. On Tuesday, she will sit for an interview in Detroit with Charlamagne Tha God, a popular Black radio host. Her campaign has also begun initiatives geared toward Black faith voters and attendees of historically Black colleges and universities, and is running ads during college football and N.F.L. games to reach men broadly.</p><p>Some Democratic Black men, including those who spoke at the town hall in Atlanta, have expressed a fear that if Ms. Harris loses, Black men will be accused of having blocked the ascent of the nation’s first Black female president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“I think it’s fair — overly fair — to say that Black women have shown up for Black men a lot,” Ryan Wilson, the chief executive of the Gathering Spot, a chain of social clubs, said during the event. “We have the opportunity as Black men to show up for a Black woman.”</p><p>Dev Coggs-Jones, 35, who works as a 911 dispatcher in Milwaukee, expressed frustration with both candidates. She cited skepticism of Ms. Harris’s past as a prosecutor, among other things. But she saw Mr. Trump as a liar who infused “blunt racism” into his language, and said she planned to vote for Ms. Harris.</p><p>What weighed on her heaviest, though, was what she saw as Mr. Biden’s lack of follow-through on his promises. For example, the president has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/biden-student-loans-supreme-court.html" title="">helped ease student loan debt</a> for millions of Americans, including many young Black voters — but she is not one of them.</p><p>“Things are not happening like they said they were,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dev Coggs-Jones, 35, said she was skeptical of Ms. Harris’s past as a prosecutor, among other things.
