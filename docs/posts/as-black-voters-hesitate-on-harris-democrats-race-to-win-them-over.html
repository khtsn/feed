In Milwaukee, dozens of volunteers fanned out across Black neighborhoods to encourage sometimes skeptical residents to vote. And in a blitz of national media interviews and campaign ads, Ms. Harris herself made her case to Black voters.</p><p>The flood of recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/harris-policies-black-men.html" title="">door-knocking, ads, rallies and celebrity-studded outreach events</a> across battleground states reflects Democrats’ growing alarm about their weakening support among Black voters — a yearslong drift that the party’s leaders have not confronted so directly, and with the stakes so high, until now.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html" title="">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> last week found that Ms. Harris was underperforming President Biden’s support with Black voters in 2020 by roughly 10 percentage points, and by 15 points among Black men — a drop-off that could doom her fortunes. The poll found that former President Donald J. Trump was making inroads, with 15 percent of Black voters saying they would back him.</p><p>Interviews with more than three dozen Black voters, strategists and elected officials offered a complicated picture of a politically powerful group of Americans whose waning devotion to the Democratic Party stems partly from a feeling that their decades of loyalty has delivered little in return. The party now finds itself in the unfamiliar position of needing to treat Black Americans as voters who must be persuaded to support them, rather than unflinching supporters who will back liberal candidates without a second thought.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Young Black men in particular say they feel disillusioned by the political system and do not see how Ms. Harris’s policies could help them. Their apathy and frustration with Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/black-men-election-georgia-trump-harris.html" title="">have provided an opening for Mr. Trump</a>.</p><p>Ms. Harris has just a few weeks left to persuade hesitant Black voters that she is the candidate who can bring the change many say they are waiting for, and to give some of them a reason to vote at all.</p><p>“People were so tired of the negative, we went to the space for joy, excitement and happiness — and that has its place,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of the voting rights group Black Voters Matter. “At this phase, it’s take your gloves off.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="People standing around and talking at a Democratic field office in Milwaukee, with campaign signs for Kamala Harris hanging around the room." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/15/multimedia/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp/15pol-harris-blackvoters-canvas-qkjp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volunteers gathered at a Democratic field office on Saturday in Milwaukee before a canvassing event.

That’s our community,” he said, later asking: “What is Trump bringing us?”</p><p>Much of Black voters’ openness to supporting Mr. Trump, the men argued, stemmed from a concerted disinformation effort. Some younger Black voters, for example, mistakenly believe that Mr. Trump has promised more of the stimulus checks that he signed during the coronavirus pandemic. Another false claim contends that as California’s attorney general, Ms. Harris went out of her way to prosecute Black men and allowed the state’s immigrants to take their jobs.</p><p>Allies of Ms. Harris see a dire need to counter this messaging.</p><p>“I think sometimes folks have short memories, but we have to remember who it is that we’re dealing with,” said Cavalier Johnson, the Democratic mayor of Milwaukee. Mr. Trump, he said, would enact policies that “make life harder for Black people, generally, in this country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Monday, Ms. Harris’s campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/harris-policies-black-men.html" title="">released a policy agenda</a> targeted heavily at Black men. The plan includes forgiving a portion of small-business loans; supporting mentorship and apprenticeship programs; and a program that would help stem health inequities for Black men.</p><p>In part, the measures offered something of a rebuttal to criticisms that the Democratic Party has neglected Black men.</p><p>“While Vice President Harris is promising to equip Black men with the tools needed to pursue our dreams and aspirations,” said Cedric Richmond, a Harris campaign co-chair, “Donald Trump is promising Black America a national nightmare.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I think sometimes folks have short memories, but we have to remember who it is that we’re dealing with,” said Cavalier Johnson, the Democratic mayor of Milwaukee.
