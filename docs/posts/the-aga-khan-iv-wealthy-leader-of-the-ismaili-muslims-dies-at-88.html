He was 88.</p><p>His death was confirmed by his Aga Khan Development Network in <a href="https://x.com/akdn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a>, the social media site. No cause was given.</p><p>Urbane, cosmopolitan and often media-averse, the Aga Khan — born Prince Karim Al-Hussaini — rejected the notion that expanding his personal fortune would conflict with his charitable ventures. He said his ability to prosper complemented his duty to enhance the lives of Ismaili Muslims, a branch of the Shiite tradition of Islam with a following of 15 million people in 35 countries.</p><p>An imam, or leader of his faith, was “not expected to withdraw from everyday life,” he once said after becoming the Aga Khan. “On the contrary, he’s expected to protect his community and contribute to their quality of life. Therefore, the notion of the divide between faith and world is foreign to Islam.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>His projects included developing the island of Sardinia’s ritzy Costa Smeralda resort area, breeding thoroughbred racehorses and establishing health initiatives for the poor in the developing world.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Aga Khan IV in 1960 with a scale model of a development project he was overseeing in Sardinia.

With his assumption of the leadership as 49th imam of Ismaili Muslims in 1957, the Aga Khan IV took the reins of a Shia Muslim lineage that claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad and imposed what he said were clear responsibilities on him.</p><p>At the time, he was a 20-year-old student of Islamic history at Harvard. That same year, Queen Elizabeth II of Britain conferred on him the nonhereditary title of His Highness, a reflection of the close ties between the two dynasties, bonded in a shared fascination with fine horses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Aga Khan 1957, shortly after inheriting the title from his grandfather.

Many of them faced upheavals, like the 1972 decision by the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin to expel Asians and the turmoil in Tajikistan following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Aga Khan was long known as a well-connected person. As such, he was able to persuade Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau of Canada, whom he had met in the 1960s, to permit thousands of Ismaili Muslims to emigrate to Canada when they were forced to leave Uganda.</p><p>His friendship with Mr. Trudeau reflected an ambiguous relationship with Canada, where he became an honorary citizen in 2010. In 2017, Mr. Trudeau’s son, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, drew censure from Canada’s ethics commissioner after he and his family accepted the Aga Khan’s hospitality with an unannounced vacation at the prince’s private residence in the Bahamas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Aga Khan met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in Ottawa, the capital, in 2016.

For his part, the Aga Khan was officially exonerated.</p><p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aga Khan’s followers in the mountainous Pamir region of Tajikistan were among those embroiled in a ruinous civil war in the 1990s against the government led by Emomali Rahmon. In response, the Aga Khan accelerated investments in power generation and a cellphone company in Tajikistan and later built health care, microfinance and other facilities, as well as the University of Central Asia in Khorog.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But the Aga Khan’s revered status among Ismaili Muslims, living mainly in Tajikistan’s Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, reportedly stirred resentments and resistance among the country’s secular leaders, who sought to block demonstrations of support for the Aga Khan.</p><p><a href="https://the.akdn/en/who-we-are/biography" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prince Karim Al-Hussaini</a> was born in Geneva on Dec. 13, 1936. He was the eldest son of the noted playboy Prince Aly Khan and his first wife, Joan (Yarde-Buller) Khan, a descendant of British aristocracy. His younger brother, Amyn Aga Khan, was born the next year.</p><p>In 1949, their parents divorced, and Prince Aly went on to marry the American actress Rita Hayworth, with whom he had a daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.</p><p>Known in his youth as Prince Karim, the Aga Khan grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, before attending school at the exclusive Institut Le Rosey in Geneva. In his late 20s, he <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/karim-aga-khan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">competed</a> for pre-revolutionary Iran in skiing at the 1964 Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prince Karim, as the Aga Khan IV was known as a youth, in 1953, when he was a student at the exclusive Institut Le Rosey in Geneva.

The couple had three children, Princess Zahra, Prince Rahim and Prince Hussain, before they divorced in 1995.

They had a son, Prince Aly Muhammad. The couple broke up a few years later and spent a decade negotiating a divorce settlement said to be worth about $60 million when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>He is survived by his children; his brother, Prince Amyn Muhammad; his half sister, Princess Yasmin; and four grandchildren.</p><p>Over the years, the Aga Khan’s business ventures were eclectic. He was a prime mover in the 1960s in building the resort of Porto Cervo, complete with a yacht club and polo tournaments, as part of the development of Sardinia’s northern Costa Smeralda as a playground for the superrich. He showed a liking for Maserati sports cars, but he also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/09/business/worldbusiness/09iht-khan.4.6569846.html" title="">invested</a> in the developing world in basic industries that made fishnets, plastic bags and matches.</p><p>In Uganda, following the overthrow of Idi Amin and the later rise of Yoweri Museveni, he joined private equity giants like the Blackstone Group in a $750 million hydroelectric scheme.</p><p>In 1960, Prince Aly, the Aga Khan’s father, died in a car crash at Suresnes, outside Paris, and his children inherited his lucrative equestrian empire, which included nine farms in Ireland and France. “The three of us found ourselves with this family tradition none of us knew the first thing about,” he told Vanity Fair in 2013.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Since then, the Aga Khan had owned, trained and bred <a href="https://www.agakhanstuds.com/Stallions/200600791/Home/en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many champion horses</a>. In France, his filly Valyra won the prestigious Prix de Diane in 2012, to establish a new owners’ record of seven wins.
