She added that he had filed for asylum in September 2022, but gave no additional details.</p><p>The attack, which the authorities were investigating as an act of terrorism, occurred on Sunday when a man used a “makeshift flamethrower” to attack people who were marching peacefully in support of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, officials said. Mr. Soliman, 45, was taken into custody after witnesses identified him as the assailant, and was <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/news/attack-pearl-street-8-victims-identified" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">booked on multiple charges</a> in the Boulder County Jail.</p><p>The charges included first-degree murder, but the authorities did not immediately confirm whether any of those injured in the attack had died.

They have done so since a few weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. They begin at Pearl and Seventh Streets and walk toward the courthouse, along a pedestrian mall.</p><p>Lisa Effress, 55, who has lived in Boulder for 17 years, has been there since the first walk. “Whenever I’m in town,” she said, “I try to be there.”</p><div><p>The ritual is simple: walk, speak the names of those still held hostage, sometimes sing “Hatikvah,” the Israel national anthem, and bear witness. The numbers vary — 20, sometimes 100. People see the group, hear the songs, and fall into step.</p><p>They wear red. It’s symbolic. It’s visible.</p><p>Ms. Effress wasn’t walking this Sunday. She was across the street, having lunch with her daughter. But lunch got cut short. She heard sirens. Police cars, ambulances.</p><p>She checked the time and figured the group must be near the courthouse. She left lunch and ran over.</p><p>“I knew immediately — I just knew,” she said. “I ran across the street, looking for everyone.”</p><p>What she found felt surreal. Smoke. Discarded clothes used to extinguish flames. People dazed, half-undressed. Bags and backpacks left behind in panic. And then, she saw a friend who was a Holocaust survivor, being helped into an ambulance.</p><p>“It was horrible,” said Ms. Effress, a filmmaker and managing partner in a post-production company. </p><p>On every walk, Ms. Effress said, she is vigilant. Alert to strange behavior, to tension in the air. “We are peaceful. We are not protesters,” she said. “But there are always people protesting us.”</p><p>She added: “I have always taught my daughter: Be proud to be Jewish. Don’t be afraid. But in a time like this, it is crazy to think we will ever be walking again. It’s dangerous, it’s not safe for us.”</p><p>She said that according to a Whatsapp chat for the walking group, the weekly walk has been canceled indefinitely.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzk4OWQ5N2E3LWY3YzktNWRhMi1iOTk2LWEyOWM0NmY1NzAwZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/02/us/boulder-colorado-attack-suspect#jewish-community-attacks-boulder-colorado" data-source-id="100000010201999"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-06-02T00:30:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">June 1, 2025, 8:30 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A vigil near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., following a shooting in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caroline Gutman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The attack on an event in Boulder, Colo., for Israeli hostages on Sunday afternoon was the latest on the Jewish community, following two others in recent weeks involving assailants who expressed anger over the war in Gaza.</p><p>On May 21, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/dc-shooting-jewish-museum-israel-embassy.html" title="">two people were fatally shot outside</a> the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., after which the suspect shouted “Free Palestine.” In April, a man set fire to the residence of Gov.

The suspect later said the fire was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/cody-balmer-motive-arson-gaza-palestinian-shapiro.html" title="">a response to Israeli attacks on Palestinians</a>.</p><div><p>“As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less,” Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, said in a statement. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.”</p><p>Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, said in a statement that the attack “appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.”</p><p>“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he added. “Hate has no place in Colorado.”</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
