No sense trying to sneak in — the guards all knew him on sight. In his head, a timer was ticking, like a shot clock. Ninety seconds. That was how long it would take for the police to respond to the 911 call the security guard would be making right now.</p><p>He hurried past the guard to get to the pharmacy area downstairs. The nearest route down was the escalator going up.</p><p>The shoplifter, David Andino, clambered down that escalator, hurtling past shoppers heading up.</p><p>Andino scooped what he could into a laundry bag, seeking out the brands he knew he could easily sell. Aveeno lotion, Cetaphil cleanser, CeraVe moisturizer. Sensodyne toothpaste, Crest White Strips.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ninety seconds.</p><p>He raced back up the escalator, past the guard, and back onto Greenwich Street and into the nearby Chambers Street subway station.</p><p>He boarded an uptown train, and the doors closed behind him. Success. Tomorrow, he would be back again.</p><p>It was 2022. Day after day, he stole from that Target store. The police arrived, too late. As he stole more and more, day after day, Andino became a one-man crime wave in the Police Department’s First Precinct in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>Eventually, officers changed tactics. They started lying in wait for Andino outside his favorite Target. Watching.</p><p>Another search was taking place across the Hudson River in New Jersey. A woman, retired from the Police Department after 20 years in rough sections of the Bronx, spent her mornings searching her computer for some sign of him in the city’s jails, or worse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her name was Elizabeth Velazquez. She was David Andino’s mother.</p><h2 id="link-2c1f51c8">A Stubborn Problem</h2><p>You have probably never laid eyes on David Andino. But you have felt, with frustration, the impact of his actions in the shaving cream and toothpaste aisles of your pharmacy, where everything is now locked behind plastic. The barriers are in response, store owners say, to rampant theft.</p><p>That claim has been questioned as overly broad — an easy scapegoat for deeper challenges facing the retail industry. Shoplifting, experts observe, has actually declined nationally.</p><p>But in New York City, it remains a stubborn daily reality. Security guards are trained not to lay hands on a person stealing, a fact that many thieves know. And those who are caught are rarely, if ever, jailed; instead they are given desk-appearance tickets for their misdemeanor offenses. They can rack these tickets up without practical consequence, until someone begins tracking one individual thief and adding his thefts until they pass $1,000 in value, the threshold for felony grand larceny.</p><p>Before he was one of the busiest shoplifters in the city, Andino was living in Harlem, and his days revolved around feeding the drug habit that had knocked him out of college and far off course. Cocaine and heroin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He panhandled on the subway, he said in an interview, but it wasn’t enough.</p><p>He needed a new hustle.</p><p>A friend, Brian, said, “You want to make $20 real quick? We go into Target and take Sensodyne.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first time he stole from Target, David Andino was certain he’d be caught and locked up.

They loaded the bag until Andino could barely lift it. They went upstairs, where he was sure security was following him.</p><p>But they weren’t.</p><p>He hurried to the subway with his heavy bag, shocked at how easy that was. They went back, sometimes carrying disguises, donning jackets and caps after leaving the store so they would look different from whatever description the police might have.</p><p>One day, Andino went to Target alone, no partner. And it still worked.</p><p>It quickly became routine, a part of his day, like a favorite coffee cart or deli.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Target employees found him stealing, and he would apologize — “I’m sorry I’m doing this, I’m sorry” — even as he kept loading his bag. Andino learned quickly that guards weren’t allowed to physically stop him. It was against store policy.</p><p>The security guards began to recognize him. “You got a minute and a half,” one guard told him one day, as if daring him.</p><p>Sometimes Andino spoke back. “You do what you do, and I’ll do what I do, and we’ll see what happens,” he’d say. “It’s not like it’s your stuff. I’m not going to your house and stealing from you.”</p><p>They waited for him at the store’s exit. Sometimes he ran out an emergency door instead. Sometimes he faced them directly.</p><p>“If they’re in front of you, you go around them,” he told himself. “Don’t go through them.”</p><h2 id="link-244d71c4">Busy Policewoman, Worried Mom</h2><p>Elizabeth Velazquez graduated from high school 19 and pregnant. David was born the following October. His father left and drifted into addiction. He later died after using an infected needle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Velazquez rebounded and went to college. She held fast to a dream job she’d had since she was about 8, growing up in the rough 1980s South Bronx. “I always wanted to be a cop,” she said. “I just wanted to be out there and make sure people are taken care of.”</p><p>She joined the Police Department in 1998. David was 9 years old, a happy child with a bright smile and a pet dog, Phoebe. If she thought her job would excite her son, she was wrong. “My son had a lot of nightmares,” she said. “He thought I was going to die. He’d come jump in my bed.”</p><p>She worked at ground zero after Sept. 11, digging for bodies. “It was bad,” she said. “I came home with a gray uniform.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As a boy, Andino feared for his mother, a police officer in the Bronx. “He thought I was going to die,” she said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">José A. Alvarado Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>David attended a Catholic elementary school until the family left the Bronx and moved to the suburbs of Warwick, N.Y. “He started smoking weed,” she recalled. “I started noticing little things.” She took out a second mortgage and sent David to the New York Military Academy in Cornwall, N.Y., hoping the discipline would curb any trouble before it really began.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It seemed to work, and David graduated and enrolled at Penn State’s rural Hazleton campus in northeastern Pennsylvania, in the foothills of the Pocono Mountains. He pitched for the baseball team and proudly wore his team’s ring.</p><p>She went to work patrolling the streets of the Bronx every day, seeing streets lined with people in the throes of drug addiction, and she thanked God her son had dodged that fate.</p><h2 id="link-66a0fc1f">‘The Sky Cracked Open’</h2><p>After arriving at Hazleton, Andino began selling OxyContin. It was easy money. He’d buy pills for $4 apiece and sell them to his fellow students for $30.</p><p>Curious, he tried one and quickly became hooked. He loved the feeling it gave him.</p><p>After two years, he crashed and dropped out.</p><p>He moved back home. Velazquez had given birth to a daughter while he was in high school; she was just 4. His mother worried about his impact on the girl, but he felt like his mother was overreacting. “She became too strict,” he said. “She cut me off. I became more desperate. I sold my baseball ring.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Like millions of other prescription-drug abusers, he became unable to afford his habit, and switched to a cheaper high: heroin.</p><p>“It was like the sky cracked open and God grabbed me,” he said. “That’s how it feels.”</p><p>He’d always been so neat and clean growing up. Now he was a mess — his clothes, his hair, his room.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andino attended the New York Military Academy in Cornwall, N.Y., where his mother sent him to protect him from drugs she saw in their neighborhood. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">José A.

She noticed some of her jewelry had gone missing. Blank checks had been removed from her checkbook.</p><p>Then, in 2010, came an anonymous note stuck to her door: “It said, ‘What you suspected about your son — you’re right. He is on heroin,’” she recalled reading.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>She demanded he take a urine test on the spot. He refused. “Somebody must have heard the commotion,” she said. “The cops came.”</p><p>That was a tipping point. “I need you out of here,” she told him.</p><h2 id="link-38b0703b">Hero at Work. Darkness at Home.</h2><p>Andino ended up in Harlem, couch surfing, crashing wherever. Haunted by the story of how his father died, he only used clean needles from a needle exchange. It provided everything he needed. Cooker, cotton, needles, tourniquet.</p><p>For a while, he stole beer from a Target store on the Upper West Side and sold it to bodegas on East 116th and Lexington. The bodegas put the beer in their coolers with their own inventory.</p><p>He called home when he needed cash between beer heists.</p><p>He taught his mother how to wire money through Western Union. She would give the store a password that Andino would need to recite in order to pick up the cash.</p><p>Something easy to remember: their pet dog.</p><p>“Phoebe,” he’d say in the Western Union outlet, collect his money and hurry to his drug dealer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Months passed since he had left home. Then years. To be a police officer and an addict’s mother was to live in a lonely, deeply uncomfortable place.</p><p>There were plenty of people suffering from addiction in her precinct of the Bronx, and she realized her son was that person, somewhere. She hadn’t seen him in years, despite being just miles away, and seemed to hear from him only when he needed money. She wondered if the police treated him as rudely as her fellow officers did people on their beats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Now retired from the Police Department, Elizabeth Velazquez went several years without seeing her son.

What’s funny about that?”</p><p>She’d wake up every morning and open the inmate locator on the city’s jails website. Mostly no hits, but every now and then, his name would appear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>He’d call her. “Mom, I’m arrested.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“I have ways.”</p><p>If he wasn’t in jail, she had one more website to check: the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, a nationwide site for unidentified or unclaimed bodies in medical examiners’ custody.</p><p>“I know it’s a little dark,” she said.</p><p>In April 2018, while on patrol, Velazquez and her partner were flagged down by a distraught woman, screaming that her baby was choking in their apartment. The officers ran up and found an 8-day-old infant, turning blue.</p><p>Velazquez performed back slaps and chest compressions while her partner, Daniel Wynohradnyk, called ahead to St. Barnabas hospital. Officers blocked intersections along their route. The baby <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/06/26/theyre-her-hometown-heroes-bronx-mom-lauds-cops-who-saved-her-choking-newborn-son/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recovered at the hospital</a>.</p><p>“The best feeling I’ve ever had as a cop of 20 years,” Velazquez <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nypd-baby-rescue/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a television reporter</a> later.</p><p>Other officers gave her a nickname. “They called me ‘the baby saver.’”</p><p>The days wore on. The baby saver awoke each morning and looked for her son’s name in the city’s morgue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><h2 id="link-4825a6da">A Shoplifter’s Prime</h2><p>In the prime of his shoplifting, Andino was stealing every morning and many evenings. He had a regular buyer on West 116th Street, he said, who resold his stolen items to customers.</p><p>They loved the smell-goods, the cosmetics, the makeup. Clothes, detergents, Downy Unstopables. Fifty of those would bring him $15. Seconds of work. He could sound like a stock boy as he described the store. Peppermint soaps. Collagen — he could sell all the collagen he could carry.</p><p>He had many other paying customers, too. Families. They wanted Ninja blenders, espresso machines, air fryers. The whole neighborhood knew him. “I’m having a big barbecue,” someone would tell him.</p><p>He’d go to a Trader Joe’s on Broadway and West 72nd Street and steal food — 20 or 40 steaks in about the time it takes to read this sentence. The store’s perpetually long line, winding through the aisles, made his work easier. “They’re all covering me,” he realized. He grabbed sockeye salmon, lamb chops, racks of ribs. He stole bacon to sell to the breakfast carts in Harlem.</p><p>He lived in a rented room with his girlfriend, who was also a thief. She liked Duane Reade.</p><p>He warned that she should diversify. “You can’t keep going in the same store the same way at the same time,” he told her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Steaks, sockeye salmon, lamb chops, ribs, beer: Andino stole whatever he could to sell to neighbors planning big barbecues. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joshua Bright for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>And yet, he ignored his own advice. Yes, he spread his stealing around several stores, but he always came back to the Target in TriBeCa.</p><p>It was sometime in 2023 when a new manager at the store caught him stealing. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he said, his usual routine, as he kept sweeping items into his bag.</p><p>She was different. “She was like, ‘<em>Him</em>,’” he said. <em>“‘</em>He comes every day. We want him.’”</p><p>On Oct. 6, 2023, a police officer arrived and handed Andino a Target trespass notice. The document formally banned him, under the threat of arrest, from entering the store. He ignored it.</p><p>October turned to November. The new store manager was watching, quietly keeping a list of dates and items stolen. When the amount of the items passed $1,000, he could be charged with felony grand larceny instead of petit larceny, a misdemeanor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>That day arrived on Nov. 12. It seemed like officers were waiting for him at the top of the escalator.</p><h2 id="link-32e0733a">Stores Crack Down and Lock Up</h2><p>In September 2023, Target <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/retail/targets-east-harlem-closure-blamed-shoplifting-saddens-neighbors-after-13-year-run" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed a store in East Harlem</a>, blaming shoplifting losses. It had been there 13 years, and was one of several stores the chain closed at the same time. Just blocks away, Andino was reselling stolen Target merchandise on East 116th Street.</p><p>That same year, the National Retail Federation <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/shrink-accounted-over-112-billion-industry-losses-2022-according-nrf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a report dedicated to “organized retail crime</a>,” as it is known in the industry. It said that in 2022, retail theft resulted in industry losses of $112.1 billion, compared with $93.9 billion the previous year.</p><p>A flowchart tracked the various ways that thieves were known to operate. Some stole from stores and fenced the goods to be shipped overseas. Some resold the goods to “local business (e.g., bodega).”</p><p>It was Andino’s playbook. Wittingly or not, he had flowed into the streams of national shoplifting patterns. His 90-second strategy, perfected over months, was actually common practice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>The industry has a name for people like Andino: boosters.</p><p>Boosters are often “individuals with economic or social vulnerabilities such as the homeless or those with substance issues,” the industry report read.</p><p>Target announced tougher policies. In July, it said that the threshold for security guards to “stop” a theft had dropped from $100 worth of stolen goods to $50, <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/retail/target-changes-shoplifting-policy-workers-stop-thefts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Bloomberg</a>. It is unclear what a “stop” entailed, as employees are still told not to physically intervene in a shoplifting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>If Andino returns to his favorite Target, he is likely to find that the items he stole with ease are now locked away. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">José A.

We want to make sure they’re safe.”</p><h2 id="link-5bee57ff">‘One Last Hurrah’</h2><p>Elizabeth Velazquez arrived at Ulster County Correctional Facility on a weekend morning last month. It would be the first time she had been in the same room with Andino since 2016, when she was still a police officer.</p><p>Sitting in the prison’s large visitation room, with barred windows offering limited views of the trees and mountains outside, she worried about what he would look like.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>He came in, and his eyes found her table. He didn’t look as bad as she feared. He had put on weight. But his teeth were a wreck, broken in the front.</p><p>Velazquez hugged him and wouldn’t let go. She cried and said, “You look so good,” over and over. “I love you so much. Please come home.”</p><p>They sat. She told Andino he needed an inpatient facility to kick drugs for good. No more street life.</p><p>He said he needed to go to Harlem to find his girlfriend and bring her with him.</p><p>“You can’t go back there,” she told him. “You can’t fix someone else until you fix yourself.” She watched his face.</p><p>“OK, OK,” he repeated, but to her, it seemed like he was just saying that.</p><p>A week later, Andino, now 35, sat down in that same room, now all but empty, for an interview. He spoke of his addiction and his stealing. He said he regretted that life, what it cost him. He didn’t see Target as a real victim. It was the same thing he used to tell the employees there: It wasn’t like he was stealing from their homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-45"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andino is serving a sentence for grand larceny in Ulster County, N.Y.
