    <h1>‘Anora’ Wins Big at Producers and Directors Guild Awards</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This tumultuous Oscar season has a certified front-runner.</p><p>On Saturday night in Los Angeles, more than a month after “Anora” lost every award it was nominated for at the Golden Globes, the Sean Baker-directed comedy took top honors at awards shows held by the Directors Guild of America and the Producers Guild of America. The later victory is especially telling: Since 2009, when both the PGA and the academy expanded their number of best-film nominees from five, the PGA winner has gone on to claim the best-picture Oscar all but three times.</p><p>The ceremonies were held opposite each other in Beverly Hills and Baker had to race from the DGAs, which wrapped first, to the PGAs. While accepting his award at the earlier ceremony, he appeared gobsmacked.</p><p>“My impostor syndrome is skyrocketing right now,” Baker said, “as well as my cortisol levels.”</p><p>The victories capped a good weekend for “Anora,” which also won the top prize at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/style/critics-choice-red-carpet-photos-2025.html" title="">Critics Choice Awards</a> on Friday night. And though Baker may be battling impostor syndrome, 18 of the last 20 DGA winners also went on to take the best-director Oscar, which puts him in good company.</p><p>Other winners at both shows included “Shogun,” and “Hacks,” which won drama-series and comedy-series awards, respectively. “Nickel Boys” director RaMell Ross took the DGA award for first-time theatrical filmmaker.</p></div></div>
