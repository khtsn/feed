Sanger has covered the Iranian nuclear program for more than 20 years, including the negotiations leading up to the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran.</p></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-12-06T18:48:44-05:00">Dec. 6, 2024, <span>6:48 p.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The United Nations’ chief nuclear inspector said on Friday that Iran was quadrupling its production of near-bomb-grade material, a move likely to intensify the challenge it will pose to the incoming Trump administration — but one that might also open the way to a new negotiation with the West.</p><p>“It is a dramatic acceleration,” Rafael M. Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said as the organization sent out a confidential assessment to its member states.</p><p>In a text message, he said that his inspectors had seen a quadrupling of production of uranium enriched to 60 percent purity, just shy of the levels needed to produce a weapon.</p><p>“These actions by Iran are worrying,” added Mr. Grossi, who visited Tehran last month and left the country in hopes that he had won its agreement to freeze new production of the fuel that has put Iran at the threshold of being able to produce a bomb.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But after the board of the I.A.E.A. passed a resolution that condemned Iran for blocking inspectors from key sites and dismantling some inspection gear, the Iranians responded by saying they would enrich uranium faster than ever before. And that appears to be exactly what they did at a plant called Fordow, built deep into a mountain so that Israel could not bomb it.</p><p>“Our inspectors are on the sites confirming that the process has indeed started,” Mr. Grossi said in a text exchange. “It is a very steep increase” that he said was still accelerating. “Now more than ever engagement and diplomacy are necessary.”</p><p>The timing of the move is striking. Iran is, by some measures, weaker than it has been in years. Its chief proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, have been crushed by Israeli onslaughts on their tunnel systems, their missiles and their leadership. It has also moved to evacuate military commanders and other personnel from Syria, after rebels in the long-running civil war there made rapid gains, posing a significant threat to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, whom Iran has staunchly supported.</p><p>Iran’s missile attacks on Israel have also largely been failures, and the air defenses around its military and nuclear sites have been badly damaged. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in mid-November that its most recent strike on Iran damaged what he called a “specific component” of Iran’s nuclear program, though both Israeli and American intelligence officials have been largely silent on what that facility was — or how significant it was to the program.</p><p>All of this has led analysts inside and outside the U.S. government to wonder which of two paths Iran may take in the next few months: toward nuclear breakout or nuclear negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The argument for breakout is an obvious one: If Iran is feeling vulnerable to an Israeli attack, or a joint operation by Israel and the United States, it may feel that its best protection lies in a true nuclear deterrent. That would require reversing a longtime command from Iran’s supreme leader banning Iran from building a weapon — a commitment that many Western intelligence agencies doubt is a real impediment.</p><p>Still the formal assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies is that Iran has not built a nuclear weapon — though it is taking the preparatory steps.</p><p>The alternative theory is that Iran is setting itself up for a new negotiation with President-elect Donald J. Trump, who pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal six years ago. At the time, he said that Iran would “come begging” for a new deal, one Mr. Trump suggested would be far more airtight, and longer lasting, than the one negotiated by the Obama administration.</p><p>Mr. Trump still seems open to that, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/iran-trump-assassination-plot.html" title="">an alleged plot by Iran</a> to kill him may have complicated the way forward.</p><p>It is unclear whether those talks would go anywhere; an exploratory meeting held by European allies recently showed no movement. But that may change after Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump takes office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Grossi, whose comments about Iran were first reported by Reuters, has been working to set the stage for those negotiations, visiting Iran and trying to convince leaders there to fully comply with inspection obligations and freeze their production of 60 percent enriched uranium, just short of the 90 percent enrichment used to make a bomb. That effort clearly failed.</p><p>On Friday, he said that monthly production of the near-bomb-grade uranium had moved from nine kilograms a month, just short of 20 pounds, to 40 kilograms, or about 88 pounds. Iran already has enough of a stockpile to make the fuel for four weapons in a matter of weeks or days. It would take another year or 18 months to produce a weapon.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David E. Sanger covers the Biden administration and national security.
