Agents also investigated valuable flight upgrades they believe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/nyregion/eric-adams-turkish-airlines-upgrades.html" title="">the mayor received from Turkish Airlines</a>.</p><p>It’s one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">several federal corruption investigations</a> that have ensnared Mr. Adams’s administration. Here are some key events that led up to the indictment of the mayor:</p><h3 id="link-4907614d"><span>Nov. 2, 2023: The F.B.I. raids the home of the chief fund-raiser to Mayor Eric Adams.</span></h3><p>Federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/nyregion/eric-adams-brianna-suggs-fbi-raid.html" title="">raided the Brooklyn home</a> of Brianna Suggs, a recent college graduate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/nyregion/eric-adams-brianna-suggs-fundraiser-fbi.html" title="">who had been in charge</a> of Mr. Adams’s fund-raising operation when he ran for mayor in 2021. Ms. Suggs was 23 years old when the mayor picked her for the job, and many Democratic officials who worked in fund-raising were shocked that he had chosen someone for the role with so little professional experience.</p><p>The agents seized three iPhones and two laptop computers from Ms. Suggs’s home; they also took papers and other evidence, including something agents identified as a “manila folder labeled Eric Adams,” as well as seven “contribution card binders” and other materials, according to the search warrant documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h3 id="link-534594a8"><span>Nov. 2, 2023: The F.B.I. raids the homes of an aide in the mayor’s international affairs office and a former Turkish Airlines executive who served on his transition team.</span></h3><p>Investigators also searched the New Jersey homes of Rana Abbasova, an aide in Mr. Adams’s international affairs office, and Cenk Öcal, a former Turkish Airlines executive who served on his transition team, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/nyregion/nyc-adams-turkey-raid-aide.html" title="">according to people familiar with the matter</a>.</p><p>Ms. Abbasova was the mayor’s longtime liaison to the Turkish community when Mr. Adams was Brooklyn borough president. Mr. Öcal was the general manager of the New York office of Turkish Airlines until early 2022.</p><h3 id="link-5181b7a5"><span>Nov. 6, 2023: The F.B.I. seizes the mayor’s phones and iPad.</span></h3><p>In early November, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/nyregion/adams-fbi-investigation-phones.html" title="">F.B.I. agents approached Mr. Adams and his security detail</a> after he had attended an event in Manhattan. The agents asked the security team to step aside before climbing into the mayor’s S.U.V. with him and taking his devices, pursuant to a court-authorized warrant. The devices were returned to the mayor within a matter of days, according to two people familiar with the situation. Law enforcement investigators can make copies of data on seized devices.</p><p>A lawyer for the mayor, Boyd Johnson, said at the time that Mr. Adams had not been accused of wrongdoing and had “immediately complied with the F.B.I.’s request and provided them with electronic devices.”</p><p>Mr. Johnson also said that Mr. Adams had already “proactively reported” at least one instance of improper behavior.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h3 id="link-5326a433"><span>Nov. 28, 2023: Adams announces that his chief fund-raiser is out.</span></h3><p>Weeks after agents searched Ms. Suggs’s home, Mayor Adams said during a weekly press briefing that she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/nyregion/brianna-suggs-adams.html" title="">no longer managing his political fund-raising</a>. He declined to say why he had removed her from the position. Ms. Abbasova was also placed on leave after City Hall learned she had “acted improperly,” according to a spokesman for the mayor.</p><h3 id="link-64b08302"><span>Feb. 5, 2024: A retired police inspector pleads guilty to funneling illegal funds to the mayor’s campaign.</span></h3><p>Dwayne Montgomery, a former police inspector, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/nyregion/eric-adams-nypd-illegal-donations.html" title="">pleaded guilty to misdemeanor conspiracy</a>, admitting to directing straw donors — people who make campaign contributions using someone else’s money — to contribute to the mayor’s campaign. Mr. Montgomery was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/nyregion/eric-mayor-adams-campaign-donation.html" title="">indicted in July 2023</a>, along with four construction executives and a bookkeeper. Mr. Montgomery agreed in his plea not to organize or host any fund-raisers or to solicit contributions for a campaign, for one year.</p><p>The mayor was not implicated in the indictment nor accused of any wrongdoing.</p><h3 id="link-7e2ee834"><span>Feb. 29, 2024: The F.B.I. searches the homes of the mayor’s Asian affairs adviser, who was a prominent fund-raiser for his campaign.</span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Federal officials searched two houses in the Bronx owned by Winnie Greco, a close aide to Mayor Eric Adams, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Dee Delgado for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/nyregion/fbi-adams-greco-investigation-nyc.html" title="">searched two houses that belonged to Winnie Greco</a>, an aide who was a prominent fund-raiser and who had close ties to the Chinese community in New York City. She became the mayor’s director of Asian affairs when he took office in 2022. The searches were part of an investigation conducted by prosecutors from the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn and it was unclear what the investigation was focused on and whether it was related to the mayor.</p><p>Agents also executed a search warrant at the New World Mall in Flushing, Queens, where Mr. Adams had made regular appearances, including to deliver remarks at a Lunar New Year gala.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h3 id="link-68fed9a6"><span>July 2024: Federal prosecutors serve a new round of subpoenas to the mayor, his election committee and City Hall.</span></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/eric-adams-fbi-investigation.html" title="">subpoenas sought information</a> in a number of areas, including travel by the mayor, his aides and others, and fund-raising. It was unclear what prompted the new subpoenas.</p><h3 id="link-5f67caed"><span>Sept. 4, 2024: Federal agents seize the phones of the police commissioner, the first deputy mayor, the schools chancellor and others.</span></h3><p>Top city officials who had their phones seized included the police commissioner, Edward A. Caban; the first deputy mayor, Sheena Wright; her partner, David C. Banks, the schools chancellor; the deputy mayor for public safety, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/nyregion/philip-banks-corruption-investigation.html" title="">Philip Banks III</a>; and a senior adviser to the mayor, Timothy Pearson.</p><p>The seizures <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html" title="">appeared to be separate</a> from the corruption investigation focused on the mayor and his campaign fund-raising, but the actions further destabilized his administration.</p><p>Terence Banks, a consultant who is the brother of both the schools chancellor and the deputy mayor of public safety, had his home searched and his phone seized. Agents seized the phones of his brothers because they believed they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/nyregion/adams-banks-consultant-investigation.html" title="">might find evidence of bribery and other crimes</a>, including fraud and violations of the Travel Act, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><h3 id="link-2f6328fa"><span>Sept. 12, 2024: The police commissioner resigns.</span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Edward Caban resigned as New York police commissioner, this month.

Media coverage about the investigations had “created a distraction for the department,” Mr. Caban said in an email to members of the Police Department.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Caban said in a statement that federal prosecutors had told them that he was not a target of the investigation and that he intended to fully cooperate with the government.</p><h3 id="link-2e22badc"><span>Sept. 15, 2024: The mayor’s chief counsel resigns.</span></h3><p>Lisa Zornberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/nyregion/lisa-zornberg-resigns-eric-adams-counsel.html" title="">resigned from her post</a> as the mayor’s counsel and chief legal adviser. She had been one of the mayor’s fiercest defenders, encouraging New Yorkers not to rush to judgment. She formerly worked as a senior Manhattan federal prosecutor in the office that is currently conducting three separate corruption investigations into the mayor and some of his senior aides.</p><h3 id="link-6d6acb6e"><span>Sept. 16, 2024: Two former Fire Department chiefs are arrested on bribery charges.</span></h3><p>Brian E.

According to two federal officials with knowledge of the matter, the materials were classified documents that had been in Mr. Donlon’s possession for years.</p><h3 id="link-509a9c1c"><span>Sept. 23, 2024: The city’s health commissioner says he will resign.</span></h3><p>Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who led New York City out of the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/vasan-health-commissioner-resigns.html" title="">became the third top administration official</a> to resign in September amid the investigations.
