    <h1>As Egg Prices Soar, U.S. Looks to Import From Other Countries</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the price of eggs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/egg-prices-bird-flu-producers.html" title="">reaches record highs</a>, the federal government is looking into importing more eggs from other countries, Brooke L. Rollins, the agriculture secretary, said on Wednesday.</p><p>Ms. Rollins, in an interview on Fox Business, said that the United States was in talks with several countries to secure immediate egg imports as a short-term solution. In addition to importing eggs, the department will invest up to $1 billion in its five-pronged approach to combating bird flu, Ms. Rollins wrote in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/agriculture-secretary-brooke-rollins-my-plan-to-lower-egg-prices-6be0f881" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>That includes providing up to $500 million in funding to egg producers to enhance biosecurity measures, $400 million in financial relief for farmers whose flocks are affected by the flu and $100 million in research and development for vaccines and therapeutics. The Agriculture Department has not yet authorized a vaccine for poultry, in part because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/us/politics/bird-flu-vaccine-chickens.html" title="">concerns that vaccination would imperil American exports</a>.</p><p>The department is also “examining the best way to protect farmers from overly prescriptive state laws,” Ms. Rollins wrote, citing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/business/california-bacon-law.html" title="">California animal welfare law</a> that has been a legal target of business groups.</p></div></div>
