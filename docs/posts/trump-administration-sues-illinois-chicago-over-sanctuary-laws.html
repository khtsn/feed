name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Trump administration filed suit in a Chicago federal court on Thursday, alleging that sanctuary laws in Illinois, Chicago and Cook County are obstructing the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration policies.</p><p>The lawsuit names Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, both Democrats, along with Superintendent Larry Snelling of the Chicago Police Department and other local elected officials in the nation’s third-largest city. It is believed to be the new Trump administration’s first legal action against state and local officials to try to make them provide more assistance in federal immigration enforcement. </p><p>The lawsuit asserts that local and state officials’ lack of cooperation with federal enforcement of immigration laws has resulted in “countless criminals being released into Chicago” who should have been subject to deportation.</p><p>Illinois and Chicago have laws in place to limit their cooperation with federal agencies’ efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. The Illinois Trust Act, which prevents local law enforcement from holding immigrant prisoners without a court warrant, was signed into law in 2017 by former Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement, Mr. Pritzker said that the Trust Act has “always been compliant with federal law and still is today.”</p><p>“Illinois will defend our laws that prioritize police resources for fighting crime while enabling state law enforcement to assist with arresting violent criminals,” he said.</p><p>A spokesman for the mayor did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.</p><p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/justice-department-immigration-enforcement.html" title="">said</a> last month that it could prosecute state and city officials who refuse to help the administration carry out its immigration agenda. It declined on Thursday to comment on the suit.</p><p>Sanctuary policies, which keep local police departments mostly removed from immigration enforcement activity, have been instituted in many liberal-leaning cities as a way to build trust with immigrant communities. Elected officials in many cities say that the policies help immigrants feel comfortable reporting crimes and interacting with health departments and schools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Trump administration conducted a multiagency immigration enforcement operation last week in Chicago, part of a vow by the president to conduct mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants across the country.</p><p>Legal experts said that even if the courts find the Trump administration’s executive orders on immigration to be constitutionally sound, that doesn’t mean they’ll go along with attempts to punish state and local officials who refuse to carry them out. </p><p>Printz v. United States, a 1997 Supreme Court ruling, found that county sheriffs couldn’t be compelled to perform background checks on gun buyers. </p><p>Several immigration advocacy groups in Illinois filed a lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month in an effort to block the agency from conducting certain immigration operations in Chicago.</p><p>Devlin Barrett<!-- --> and <!-- -->Mattathias Schwartz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-bosman">More about Julie Bosman</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Immigrant Communities in Hiding: </strong>Across the country, schools, churches and shops are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/immigrant-communities-hiding-ice.html">feeling the chilling effect</a> of President Trump’s deportation threats, as migrants alter their routines.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside a Chaotic Deportation Flight: </strong>The Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/americas/us-brazil-deportations.html">first flight deporting Brazilians</a> involved aborted takeoffs, sweltering heat, emergency exits and shackled deportees on a wing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asking Students’ Immigration Status: </strong>Oklahoma education leaders approved a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/oklahoma-schools-immigration.html">request proof of citizenship or immigration status</a> from families when they enroll their children in public schools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talk of ‘Sanctuary Cities’ Fades: </strong>Unlike at the beginning of the first Trump administration, some state and local officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/democrats-sanctuary-cities-trump.html">are using more tempered language</a> to describe their policies to protect immigrants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Birthright Citizenship: </strong>Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is already facing lawsuits, but that has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/birthright-citizen-children-migrant.html">little comfort to undocumented women</a> who expect to give birth after the order goes into effect.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
