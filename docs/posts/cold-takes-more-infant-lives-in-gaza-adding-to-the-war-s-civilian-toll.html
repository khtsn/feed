On Monday, Ali died, according to Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency.</p><p>The twins, who had been born premature, join a growing list of weather-related fatalities in the Gaza Strip, the Gaza health ministry said.</p><p>Humanitarian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-human-rights.html" title="">conditions</a> have deteriorated in Gaza, where the Israeli military’s bombardment and attacks have displaced 90 percent of the population at least once, according to United Nations agencies. Since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, with a raid on Israel by the Gaza-based militant group Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis, more than 45,300 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its statistics. At least 17,492 of those killed were children, the ministry says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Born into war, Gaza’s youngest are now struggling with the cold.</p><p>Tens of thousands of displaced Gazans are living in ramshackle encampments along the coast, with little more than tents and tarps to protect them from the cold and rain. The tents, once so difficult to obtain they were considered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/middleeast/gaza-displaced-winter-tents.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">luxury</a>, have largely disintegrated after a year of exposure to the elements, leaking and providing little protection from the biting wind, humanitarian organizations say.</p><p>There is almost no electricity in the enclave, and not enough fuel to keep generators going. There is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing, and little wood for fires.</p><p>“Children in Gaza are cold, sick and traumatized,” said Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF spokesperson who recently visited Gaza’s camps for the displaced. “Many still wear summer clothes. With cooking gas gone, many are searching through rubble for scraps of plastic to burn.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
