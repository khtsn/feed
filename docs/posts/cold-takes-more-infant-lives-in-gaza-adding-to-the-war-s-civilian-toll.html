Since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023, with a raid on Israel by the Gaza-based militant group Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis, more than 45,300 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its statistics. At least 17,492 of those killed were children, the ministry says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Born into war, Gaza’s youngest are now struggling with the cold.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ali al-Batran at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza on Sunday.

The tents, once so difficult to obtain they were considered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/middleeast/gaza-displaced-winter-tents.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">luxury</a>, have largely disintegrated after a year of exposure to the elements, leaking and providing little protection from the biting wind, humanitarian organizations say.</p><p>There is almost no electricity in the enclave, and not enough fuel to keep generators going. There is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing, and little wood for fires.</p><p>“Children in Gaza are cold, sick and traumatized,” said Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF spokesperson who recently visited Gaza’s camps for the displaced. “Many still wear summer clothes. With cooking gas gone, many are searching through rubble for scraps of plastic to burn.”</p><p>On Friday, with weather forecasts warning of falling temperatures, the Palestinian Civil Defense emergency service urged Gazans, especially those in tent encampments, to take extra precautions. It recommended drinking warm fluids, wearing layers and exercising to generate body heat. Parents were encouraged to closely monitor their children’s body temperatures. The service also suggested insulating tents and shelters with cardboard under bedding and along walls to reduce heat loss.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But with more heavy rain expected in the coming days, and lows in the mid-40s Fahrenheit, those measures may not be enough to ward off more suffering from the cold.</p><p>Abu Bakr Bashir<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
