President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans say they fuel crime and make cities unsafe.</p><p>Now, as Mr. Trump prepares to re-enter the White House, the future of the sanctuary movement is likely to take center stage, most notably in New York, a city that is home to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/nyregion/trump-migrants-deportation-nyc.html" title="">more than 400,000 undocumented immigrants</a> and has long cherished its reputation as a safe haven.</p><p>Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, is intent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/adams-migrants-sanctuary-nyc.html" title="">on changing the city’s sanctuary laws</a> to allow his administration to work more closely with federal agents to deport criminals. But even as New Yorkers have signaled a greater appetite for a harder line on immigration as the city navigates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/nyc-migrant-shelters.html" title="">a two-year migrant influx</a>, many Democrats still oppose Mr. Adams’s stance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>As changes loom, here’s what you need to know about New York’s sanctuary laws.</p><h2 id="link-2f1397cd">How did New York become a sanctuary city?</h2><p>The term “sanctuary city” is not a legal designation, but rather a catchall phrase to describe jurisdictions like New York that have adopted policies that afford some protection to undocumented immigrants against federal agents seeking to detain or deport them.</p><p>Sanctuary policies often vary, but think of them as a wall blocking communication between immigration agents and city workers who interact with undocumented immigrants. They were initially enacted to encourage immigrants to report crimes, get medical treatment, enroll in schools and seek other city services without fear that they would be detained.</p><p>New York City’s sanctuary policies date back to the 1980s, when Mayor Edward I. Koch issued <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/records/pdf/executive_orders/1989EO124.PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> prohibiting city agencies from sharing information about immigrants with federal authorities unless they were suspected of criminal activity. Subsequent mayors reissued the order, and other cities adopted similar policies, leading to pushback from the federal government.</p><p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went to court to defend the order after Congress passed a law in 1996 to prevent local governments from withholding information from federal agents, but lost. To comply with the federal law, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/23/nyregion/mayor-s-new-immigrant-policy-intended-to-help-raises-fears.html" title="">a slightly different order</a> in 2003, forbidding city employees from asking anyone their immigration status, except in certain instances.</p><h2 id="link-6bba2bc3">What are the city’s sanctuary policies today?</h2><p>In 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio drastically expanded the scope of the sanctuary provisions.</p><p>He signed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/nyregion/city-would-stop-honoring-many-immigrant-detainment-orders.html" title="">bills into law</a> that all but stopped the city’s police and jails from helping federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents deport undocumented immigrants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the time, deportations had reached record highs under President Barack Obama — about 400,000 immigrants nationwide each year. One reason for the increase was that ICE was working closely with localities to quickly transfer immigrants arrested on criminal charges to ICE custody once they were released from local prisons and jails.</p><p>ICE did so by using fingerprint records, for example, to find inmates who might be subject to deportation. The agency would then issue a “detainer,” or a request that the local jail or police department hold the person for up to 48 hours after their release so that ICE could pick them up.</p><p>That pipeline — from city jails to ICE custody — led to a sharp increase in ICE apprehensions in New York, fueling outcry from Democrats who argued that the city should not be using its resources to help the federal government deport people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters outside City Hall last year as Mayor Eric Adams of New York met with Thomas D. Homan, the president-elect’s so-called border czar.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>To curb the practice, Mr. de Blasio enacted laws that kicked ICE out of the offices the agency maintained at the Rikers Island jail complex and strictly limited the communication allowed between ICE and the city’s Department of Correction.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The laws also restricted city agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. The city could only honor requests for those who had been convicted of “violent or serious” crimes — a list of more than 170 crimes that includes rape and murder. ICE also now had to present a warrant signed by a federal judge with each request.</p><p>Those laws, which ICE vocally opposed at the time, are still in effect today.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio followed up with other roadblocks after Mr. Trump won the presidency in 2016. They included guidelines that require ICE to present judicial warrants to enter city buildings, such as schools and homeless shelters. A state law passed in 2020 also barred ICE officers from arresting people at state, city and municipal courthouses.</p><h2 id="link-359bcab9">What has been the impact of the sanctuary laws?</h2><p>The laws do not prohibit ICE from arresting and deporting people in New York, even if they have hampered the agency’s ability to do so.</p><p>ICE officers have broad authority to arrest noncitizens across the city — on the street, at workplaces, in their homes — and place them in deportation proceedings, with or without the city’s cooperation. The agency has about 400 staff members in New York City and a field office at 26 Federal Plaza, the federal building a block away from City Hall that also houses the city’s immigration court.</p><p>But the 2014 laws significantly eroded the practice of transferring jailed immigrants to ICE custody. Before the laws, the Department of Correction and the Police Department transferred thousands of immigrants to ICE each year because of detainer requests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the year leading up to June 30, 2023, the Correction Department <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doc/downloads/pdf/Annual_ICE_Report_FY_2023.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received 201 detainer requests</a> from ICE and transferred only 10 people. The Police Department <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/civil_immigration_detainers/summary-civil-immigration-detainers-7-1-2022-6-30-2023.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received 109 detainer requests</a> for people it held during the same time period. None were transferred to ICE.</p><p>ICE says that obtaining judicial warrants is difficult, leading to fewer detainer requests. The agency also contends that it should not be required to present warrants for people whom ICE is seeking to apprehend for immigration violations, which are civil, not criminal, offenses.</p><p>The agency <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nyc-sanctuary-policies-continue-shield-criminal-aliens" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has long argued</a> that sanctuary provisions have led the city to release dangerous criminals who could have been quickly deported if ICE had been notified.</p><p>In December, ICE publicized its <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ero-new-york-city-arrests-unlawfully-present-mexican-citizen-child-sex-offender" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrest of</a> a Mexican man outside his home in Queens, shortly after he completed a 60-day sentence for a sex offense involving a child. The man had illegally entered the United States five times. Last summer, a Nicaraguan migrant, who was released from jail pending trial on rape charges, was rearrested after being accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/nyregion/migrant-rape-assault-coney-island.html" title="">sexually assaulting a homeless woman</a> in Coney Island. ICE officials blamed the lack of coordination with city agencies for its failure to deport the man.</p><p>Federal officials say the lack of local cooperation has led ICE to make more arrests out in the open, instead of in a controlled environment like a local jail. Making arrests on the streets, the agency says, is time-consuming, more costly and puts its officers at increased risk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Supporters of immigrants’ rights say jail officials <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/teamsendthemback-private-emails-reveal-cozy-relationship-cooperation-between-nyc-correction-officers-and-ice" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have shared information with ICE</a> despite the sanctuary laws, and that more cooperation with deportation efforts would threaten migrant defendants’ rights to due process and would undermine trust between the police and people who witness crimes.</p><h2 id="link-7c1ee95a">What does Mayor Adams want to do?</h2><p>Over the past year, as a number of high-profile crimes committed by migrants roiled the city, Mr. Adams began to float the idea of changing the sanctuary laws to allow the city to more easily collaborate with ICE in pursuing dangerous criminals.</p><p>Mr. Adams, arguing that the de Blasio-era laws were an overreach, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/nyregion/adams-deport-migrants-crime.html" title="">has said</a> the city should be able to turn over immigrants who have been accused of crimes, even if they have not been convicted. He even suggested that constitutional due-process rights should not apply to people who entered the country illegally and have committed crimes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Eric Adams has floated the idea of changing the city’s sanctuary laws to better help ICE pursue dangerous criminals.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle V.

Homan, the president-elect’s so-called border czar, at City Hall to find common ground with the incoming Trump administration.</p><h2 id="link-65b12876">What about the rest of the state?</h2><p>New York City has the most robust sanctuary provisions in the state, but <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2019/07/where-are-new-yorks-sanctuary-cities/177191/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a handful</a> of other jurisdictions — including Albany, Ithaca and Westchester County — have also passed measures to limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p><p>The state has <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2024/12/new-york-really-sanctuary-state/401894/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a loose patchwork</a> of executive orders, many signed by former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, that restrict the sharing of information between the federal government and state law enforcement agencies, as well as the arrest of immigrants in state facilities.</p><p>But state law does not outright prohibit localities from collaborating with ICE.</p><p>Some Republican-dominated areas, such <a href="https://longisland.news12.com/nassau-county-executive-bruce-blakeman-affirms-support-for-mass-deportation-policy-vows-county-assistance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as Nassau County</a> on Long Island, have working relationships with ICE and have expressed an interest in helping Mr. Trump carry out mass deportations. Rensselaer County <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/migrant-influx-sparks-questions-rensselaer-18329326.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is the only county</a> in New York that has entered into a formal agreement with ICE — under a program known as 287(g) — to deputize local officers to carry out immigration enforcement actions.</p><p>In Albany, immigration activists are lobbying the Democratic-controlled State Capitol for a series of bills that would enact sweeping safeguards for immigrants across the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>One bill would sharply limit all state and local agencies from cooperating with ICE, as well as with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
