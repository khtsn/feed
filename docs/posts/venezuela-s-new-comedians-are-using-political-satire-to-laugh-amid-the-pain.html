    <h1>Venezuela’s New Comedians Are Using Political Satire to Laugh Amid the Pain</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Estefanía León, a young Venezuelan comedian, once wondered how she could keep making jokes amid so much tragedy.</p><p>It was 2017, and she was living in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, at the worst point in her country’s economic crisis. Protests convulsed the nation, while food shortages left millions hungry and hyperinflation erased savings overnight.</p><p>Her father, at the time<strong> </strong>very ill, would rise at three in the morning to line up to buy food before supplies ran out. Ms. Léon was working seven days a week but could not afford his medication.</p><p>Her job as a writer at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/world/americas/21venezuela.html" title="">El Chigüire Bipolar</a>, a wildly popular website for political satire, required her to churn out jokes on a daily basis. But she was dodging tear gas on the way to the office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Then the government, controlled by an increasingly authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro, <a href="https://cpj.org/2018/02/venezuelas-anti-hate-law-provides-maduro-with-anot/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed legislation</a> outlawing many kinds of speech. She wondered if her jokes would land her in prison.</p><p>Comedy, she said, had been her trench, the place from which she lobbed political and social critique. “Now, there was nothing to laugh at,” she said. “There’s no food, there’s no money, there’s a dictatorship, and I’m scared.”</p><p>She fled to Mexico City in 2018. At first she focused on surviving. But eventually, she returned to humor.</p><p>And today <a href="https://www.instagram.com/estufania/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. León</a> plays a principal role in a larger Venezuelan comedy boom, whose protagonists work and live mostly outside their country, now free, for the most part, to say what they want.</p><p>Some nations elevate their novelists or poets to positions of cultural eminence; Venezuela has long viewed its comedians as among its most important societal expositors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Now, with nearly eight million Venezuelans having fled their homes since 2015, that talent is moving abroad.</p><p>These comedians include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@elgeorgeharris?app=desktop" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">George Harris</a> in the United States, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joserguzman/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">José Rafael Guzmán</a> in Mexico and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nanutria/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Víctor Medina</a> in Argentina. Mr. Medina, known by his childhood nickname Nanutria, performed last year with others at Luna Park, a stadium in Buenos Aires that normally hosts Argentine rock gods like Charly Garcia and international superstars like Shakira.</p><p>Ms. León, 33, is one of three producers of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elcuarticopod/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">El Cuartico</a>, a weekly video sketch and podcast project streaming across social media and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3DUcbnW05lnJnJb7OV6AMq" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">audio platforms</a>. On TikTok they have more than 600,000 followers, representing just a slice of their fan base.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/14/world/14venezuela-comedy-02/14venezuela-comedy-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/14/world/14venezuela-comedy-02/14venezuela-comedy-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/14/world/14venezuela-comedy-02/14venezuela-comedy-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Three people seated at a table with microphones in front of them." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/14/world/14venezuela-comedy-02/14venezuela-comedy-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/14/world/14venezuela-comedy-02/14venezuela-comedy-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/14/world/14venezuela-comedy-02/14venezuela-comedy-02-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/14/world/14venezuela-comedy-02/14venezuela-comedy-02-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Chucho Roldán, Ms. León and Daniel Enrique Pérez, at their studio in Mexico City, recording an episode of their podcast.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marian Carrasquero for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>When El Cuartico began in 2020, the group started by addressing universal topics — “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ730Uwm3kA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Secrets of OnlyFans</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAv8ocgtOXE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Contraceptives for Men, please!</a>” were the titles of two early podcasts — attempting to attract a diverse, Spanish-speaking audience.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But they found themselves drawn to themes closer to the Venezuelan experience, like migration and authoritarianism, that they thought few Spanish-language humorists were touching in a sophisticated way.</p><p>Soon, their voices and videos were reaching hundreds of thousands of people in their search for a Venezuelan identity abroad. Today, all three members of El Cuartico make a living from comedy.</p><p>Recent video sketches feature Ms. León in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_1mqbBykZA/?igsh=aXN4cDVxMmZ2bXY2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a fictional U.S. migration line</a>, trying to charm a border agent named Larry into believing that she’s just coming for a short visit.</p><p>He eyes her belongings, which include four suitcases, an air fryer and an arepa griddle called a budare, which she hugs to her chest like a life preserver.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/world/americas/Migracion-Video-2/Migracion-Video-2-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A video sketch episode produced by El Cuartico titled “Migración.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span> Courtesy of El Cuartico</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Finally, under Agent Larry’s imposing glare — experienced by pretty much every Venezuelan who has crossed a border in the last 10 years — she explodes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Yes!

Last month the group examined a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elcuarticopod/reel/DAZk29SyaHn/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national obsession</a> with skinny jeans, including a sketch featuring a man who is unable to remove his too-tight pants.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Chucho Roldán, 36, Ms. León’s colleague at El Cuartico, attributed their popularity to the collapse of the Venezuelan entertainment industry amid the political crisis and a near absence of Venezuelan characters in mainstream international entertainment.</p><p>“There is nothing for us,” said Mr. Roldán, “and we want to see ourselves.”</p><p>Leonardo Martínez, 38, who left Venezuela for Puerto Rico in 2014, said that the group had helped him reconnect with his Venezuelan identity, which had been “tucked away amid all the anger, frustration and national heartbreak.”</p><p>“I barely see Venezuelans here,” he said of his new home, “so things like El Cuartico, you cling to them.”</p><p>Just before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/world/americas/venezuela-election-maduro.html" title="">a recent crackdown</a> on dissidents in the country — roughly 2,000 people have been detained since a disputed election in late July — the trio embarked on a risky five-city tour inside Venezuela. There, they were received like celebrities and filled theaters, including an iconic amphitheater in the capital of Caracas.</p><p>Outside their country, the three continue using a distinctly Venezuelan cadence (very fast) and vocabulary (a girl is not a “chica” but a “chama,” a friend is not an “amigo” but a “pana”) and have kept Venezuelan references. (In the migration sketch, Ms. León attempts to bring her air fryer to the United States so she can make tequeños, beloved cheese sticks whose consumption is practically a patriotic duty.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Roldán, Ms. León and Mr. Pérez.

But at the same time, the most beautiful moments I have had as an adult and in my career have been outside” of Venezuela, he said. “I don’t know if I would be doing comedy, much less at this level, if I had stayed.”</p><p>In recent months the political situation in Venezuela has gone from difficult to dire. Following the July election that Mr. Maduro is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-election-results.html" title="">widely viewed to have stolen</a>, his security forces have detained hundreds of people, many of them everyday citizens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Colina performing in Columbus, Ohio.
