That request, which came from air traffic controllers at the Pentagon, arose from a short period in which the controllers lost audio and visual contact with the helicopter just moments before it was set to land, the official said.</p><p>The helicopter “initiated a go-around due to a delay in clearance from the Pentagon Tower,” the Army wrote in its statement. The Associated Press earlier <a href="https://apnews.com/article/army-helicopter-airport-collision-airlines-ff0cacada07048c43b55c6c4afeef256" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> details of the Army review.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are also investigating the event and declined to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The May 1 episode, which included the aborted landings of a Delta Air Lines flight and a Republic Airways flight, has been under unusual scrutiny because of the recent spate of problems in U.S. aviation.</p><p>In January, a midair collision near National Airport between a different Army Black Hawk helicopter and a commercial flight from Wichita, Kan., killed 67 people. And in recent weeks, air traffic control centers from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/newark-airport-delays.html" title="">Philadelphia</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/air-traffic-control-denver-faa.html" title="">the Denver area</a> have been affected by equipment outages that have frightened controllers, raising concerns about air safety.</p><p>The F.A.A. oversees the National Airport air traffic control tower and has been working to address the equipment and staffing troubles. At a Senate hearing last week, Franklin McIntosh, then the deputy chief operating officer of the F.A.A., said that his agency had not known until the May 1 episode that a hotline linking the Pentagon’s controllers to their counterparts at the National Airport tower had been inoperable for three years. In the meantime, the two entities were communicating over a landline, officials have said.</p><p>“We were extremely troubled by the incident that occurred,” Mr. McIntosh said, adding that the Defense Department had suspended certain operations in the National Airport airspace afterward. A repaired hotline would be necessary in order for the flights to resume, the F.A.A. official added.</p><p>The aviation agency recently restricted a particularly treacherous helicopter flight route in the National Airport vicinity and mandated that Army flights operate with a location broadcasting system called ADS-B Out. The Army said on Friday that the Black Hawk in the May 1 episode was using ADS-B Out at the time and that it was also flying on an approved route.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Army also said in its statement that one of the commercial flights was diverted because of a problem with National Airport controllers’ “sequencing” of air traffic. The second diversion request stemmed from conflicting aircraft location data, the statement added, without providing details.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Kelly covers money, policy and influence for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
