Experts say a technique used to maneuver the ship into the water sideways was part of the problem.</p><p>It was the first time analysts had observed North Korea using the sideways launch for warships and pointed to a lack of experience, as well as political pressure from Mr. Kim for quick results, for the mishap. Three shipyard officials, including the chief shipyard engineer, and a senior munitions official have been arrested, the official Korean Central News Agency reported, after Mr. Kim called the capsizing a criminal act.</p><p>Satellite imagery from three days before the accident showed the 470-foot-long vessel, the biggest class of warships Pyongyang has ever built, on top of a launch ramp. About 40 meters from the ship, a structure that appeared to be a viewing area and likely where Mr. Kim was stationed during the incident, was under construction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxar Technologies</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The destroyer was assembled in Chongjin, a port city on North Korea’s northeastern coast, which is known for producing smaller vessels, such as cargo ships and fishing boats. In <a href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/failed-launch-and-damage-of-the-second-guided-missile-destroyer/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a report</a> published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research institute in Washington, analysts said the shipyard “undoubtedly” lacked expertise in manufacturing and launching large warships.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The ill-fated warship was assessed by analysts to be the same size and configuration as the Choe Hyon guided missile destroyer, the North’s first destroyer and the most powerful surface ship the country has ever built. That vessel is the pride of Mr. Kim’s ambitious plan to modernize and expand his Soviet-era naval fleet, and was the centerpiece of a grand christening ceremony last month in Nampo, a west coast port near Pyongyang.</p><p>State media footage showed an elaborate event with confetti and fireworks that was attended by Mr. Kim and his daughter, Kim Ju-ae. A large viewing platform was set up near the Choe Hyun, which was already afloat in the water.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/27visualUploader-2080-cover/27visualUploader-2080-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/27visualUploader-2080-cover/27visualUploader-2080-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/05/27/140710_1_27visualUploader-2080_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Korean Central Television via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>That launch went smoothly, according to state media. Engineers used a technique common for large and heavy vessels. They appear to have built the Choe Hyun inside a roofed construction hall in Nampo, brought it out on a floating dry dock and then set it afloat by letting water into the dry dock, said Choi Il, a retired South Korean Navy captain.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the shipyard in Chongjin didn’t have a dry dock large enough to build a Choe Hyun-class destroyer nor an incline to slide the ship stern first into the water. Engineers built the ship on the quay under a netting. When it was completed, they had to launch it sideways off the platform.</p><p>When properly executed, the vessel glides down the slipway lengthwise and briefly plunges into the water, like this <a href="https://www.navy.mil/Resources/Fact-Files/Display-FactFiles/Article/2171607/littoral-combat-ship-class-lcs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3,500-ton USS Cleveland</a> warship did in Wisconsin in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/26visualUploader-41851-cover/26visualUploader-41851-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sheriff Randy Miller via Storyful</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Often a tugboat is stationed nearby to assist after the launch.</p><p>But when engineers tried to push the North Korean destroyer into the water, it lost its balance, state media said. Satellite imagery taken two days after the accident showed the ship covered in blue tarp and lying on its right side. The bow was stuck on the ramp as the stern jutted into the harbor. The viewing platform had been removed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxar Technologies</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Launching big ships sideways requires delicate balancing work, said Mr. Choi, the retired South Korean Navy captain. The heavy weapons mounted on the destroyer could have made the task even more difficult, he added.</p><p>A few days after the first Choe Hyun-class destroyer was launched last month, Mr. Kim proudly watched it test-fire various missiles. He has visited shipyards to exhort engineers to meet his timetable for naval expansion and appears to have planned to launch the second destroyer with similar fanfare and weapons tests.</p><p>Engineers at Chongjin, who worked with less developed facilities than their peers in Nampo, must have felt enormous pressure after the successful launch in Nampo, South Korean analysts said. That might have led them to cut corners, they said.</p><p>North Korea has said that it can restore the ship’s balance by pumping out the seawater. In another 10 days or so, it could repair the ship’s side damaged in the accident, according to state media.</p><p>But the damage looked worse than the country claimed, said Yang Uk, an expert on the North Korean military at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. The accident may be due not only to a defective sideways launching system but also to the ship’s structural imbalance, he said.</p><p>“The ship looks a bit twisted after the accident,” he said. “It doesn’t appear to have been built with the structural strength required for a warship.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.</p></div><div><p>Jiawei Wang is a video journalist for The New York Times based in Seoul.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
