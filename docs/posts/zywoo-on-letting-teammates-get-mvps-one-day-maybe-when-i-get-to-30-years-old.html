                  <p><strong>ZywOo, congratulations on the PGL Cluj-Napoca victory. MVP number 30 to go along with it, that&#39;s a nice and round number.</strong></p>
                  <p>A really good number. It was also the... I won&#39;t say the goal, but I was really close to get 30 MVPs, so it was kinda in my mind, as well. Happy to succeed in that in PGL, happy with my performance, and mostly happy with Vitality&#39;s performance as well.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>I will always try to push myself harder when I see flameZ or ropz get closer [to the MVP]</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>We saw in Budapest, ropz was really close to getting one, here flameZ challenged you. When is one gonna go the other way? Are you ever gonna let one go?</strong></p>
                  <p>One day, maybe, when I get to 30 years old. But it is not the time, I will always try to push myself harder when I see flameZ or ropz get closer, it also pushes myself to be harder on myself and to be harder. I will always try to put a trial for them to make it harder for the MVP, we&#39;re always gonna win the tournament if they are playing like this, so it&#39;s good, of course.</p>
                  <p><strong>PARIVISION are a very unique team. How different was the preparation leading up to it and the approach to them as a team?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think in terms of approach and in terms of anti-strat, it was kinda good for us because, finally, we were playing a new team and we could see a new thing, new strategies we can put or anything like this.</p>
                  <p>Obviously, we knew they can be dangerous, like we saw on Inferno, we could have lost this game really easily if we didn&#39;t manage this comeback. It&#39;s always hard to play against Jame, anyway. He&#39;s always playing slow or having a good call at good moments, so we always have to take care of it. It&#39;s good to play a new team in a best-of-five.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>We have a super mentality, and that&#39;s how we can say we are the champions for now</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>You guys came up with clutch after clutch from 11-7 down. It just seems like you are unstoppable in this, even if you&#39;re in such difficult positions, you always come up with the plays to come back.</strong></p>
                  <p>Even though we are 11-7, I didn&#39;t feel the team going down. It was always someone trying to speak or trying to find a solution about the next round, what we can do. That&#39;s our mentality. We can be down 11-7 or up 12-7 or anything like this, we always try to find the solution. We have a super mentality. Our mentality was really great, and that&#39;s how we can say we are the champions for now.</p>
                  <p><strong>How satisfying was that 1v2?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, it was good! It&#39;s not often I have a flick like this. I&#39;m not a flicker, I don&#39;t usually do that, but it feels good to win a 1v2 like this, especially for the comeback. Yeah, feels good, even flameZ told me, &#39;I will rewatch this because it was fucking clean.&#39;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>So what&#39;s next now? You guys have skipped ESL Pro League, so, vacation?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, of course. A bit of vacation, a bit of rest for the team because, yeah, we need it. It&#39;s been almost one month, even more, that we are on the road, so a bit of rest, a bit of chilling, vacation, all this kind of stuff, just to have a fresh mind to come back stronger.</p>
                  <p><strong>When I spoke to flameZ after you went through the group stage, he was saying that priorities might have changed now that you are one away from the ESL Grand Slam. That&#39;s the next one for you for you in Rio. That&#39;s the goal now?</strong></p>
                  <p>When you are close like this to the Grand Slam, it&#39;s always the goal. The Grand Slam and the Major are pretty much the same, we are gonna try to peak at the same level for both tournaments. The next tournament in Rio, we&#39;re gonna try to give our best for that and obviously in front of the amazing crowd in Rio. We&#39;re not gonna change much, we&#39;re just gonna play our game, try to find out what we can improve, still. We&#39;re gonna play as Vitality has done since a year ago, even more now.</p>
