Weather and water command the field, and the pace of life bends to meet them.</p><p>Existence there is one of self-reliance, where stoves are fed with hand-chopped firewood, dinner is often vegetables from the garden and homes are secluded refuges, especially in winter.</p><p>“It’s one of the most idyllic places,” said Joe Herrin, an architect in Seattle who grew up boating around the San Juans. In 2002, he and his wife, Belinda Bail, bought a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/realestate/cabin-washington-orcas-island.html" title="">vacation home</a> on the largest of them, Orcas Island, where their family now spends every summer and several weeks in the off season.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09sp-design-orcas-08-lgcz/09sp-design-orcas-08-lgcz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09sp-design-orcas-08-lgcz/09sp-design-orcas-08-lgcz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/09/multimedia/09sp-design-orcas-08-lgcz/09sp-design-orcas-08-lgcz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman in a blue shirt sits on a bench and a man in a brown sweater leans against a window.

For decades, they had made family pilgrimages to Orcas Island, and they spent several years camping in a tent on their land before deciding to build.</p><p>“As a sailor, Joe is very tuned in to the natural rhythms that impact a home,” Mr. Donat, 62, said in a recent video call. The cabin offered little disturbance to the seven-acre, heavily forested site, which included a treeless clearing on the property’s highest point with views of the U-shape island’s inlet and the Olympic Mountains beyond.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bookshelves in the living area were integrated into a seating nook, with storage drawers below and tongue-and-groove ceilings above.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Pogue</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Herrin designed for the family a simple glass-and-wood structure that edges into the highland clearing, opening to the landscape at every opportunity. The cabin and much of its contents are made from local materials and assembled by island artisans.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Because the clients were coming from another state, I wanted them to arrive at their home and instantly feel like they were in the Pacific Northwest,” Mr. Herrin said. “The material selection and being ruthless about working with a local team were all in service of that.”</p><p>The home was split into two structures organized around an old growth Douglas fir tree. “We suggested having the primary bedroom be in a separate building so they would always have to go outside to reach it,” Mr. Herrin said of his clients.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Interior handrails and fireplace surrounds were supplied by a local steel fabricator.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Pogue</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The approach created space for an exterior deck containing an outdoor dining area. Mr. Herrin designed the picnic table, which was built on nearby Obstruction Island out of cedar wood. “It was another little way of helping root the project in its place,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>A local contractor assembled a team of fabricators and subcontractors from the San Juan Islands to do the finishing. For the floors, ceilings and cabinetry, the team used mixed-grain Douglas fir, all of which was sourced and milled on Orcas Island. The wood-framed windows and doors were built by a company 30 miles from Orcas. Interior handrails and fireplace surrounds were supplied by a local steel fabricator.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Donat family’s collection of green-and-white McCoy pottery inspired the sea-foam green kitchen island.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Pogue</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Bookshelves that were integrated into a seating nook, with storage drawers below and tongue-and-groove ceilings above, required close coordination between the cabinetmaker, the framer and the finish carpenters. Above the half-wall defining the seating area, sliding panels open to reveal a guest room, where a built-in desk of Douglas fir frames a view of the dominating fir tree just outside.</p><p>“The idea was, if we are going to make a small house, let’s make it a jewel box,” Mr. Donat said.</p><p>The family’s collection of green-and-white McCoy pottery inspired the sea-foam green kitchen island. Along with tiles from the revived midcentury company Heath Ceramics, they create a homey vintage feeling.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The primary bedroom, which is in a separate building.

With their daughter off to college, their primary home felt empty. “We had a life moment where we fantasized about downsizing and living simply, so we did it,” said Mr. Donat, who is now chief marketing officer of Constellation, a New York software company.</p><p>The house will function at net-zero energy when a planned photovoltaic panel array is installed on the roof. And it has been prepared to withstand increasingly common smoke pollution in the summer forest fire season, with an energy-recuperating fan with HEPA filters.</p><p>The Donats are slowly acclimating to island life, with its ever-changing weather and inconvenient travel. “Living here has taught me a level of surrender and to embrace quiet time,” Mr. Donat said. “It’s very different from how we lived previously, but I love that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Donats, who were living in Southern California, became so enamored with the cabin that they made it their full-time residence. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Pogue</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div>
