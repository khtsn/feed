Registrations there of the Model Y increased in April.</p><p>But more than half of those were for used cars, not the latest updated Juniper version, according to the Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council. It noted that Tesla saw its share of the market, which it long dominated, slip to 11 percent, down from 18 percent at the same time last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Tesla is nowhere near the level we are used to, you can’t pretend otherwise,” said Oyvind Solberg Thorsen, director of the council.</p><p>Chinese-made electric vehicles continued to grow in popularity in Europe. BYD, for example, recorded an increase of 755 percent for April in Germany, despite the European Union’s 27 percent import tariffs. In Britain, where the E.U. tariff does not apply, the Chinese company’s sales increased 311 percent.</p><p>Germany’s Volkswagen has also seen a recovery in Europe, with increased demand for its battery-powered vehicles and sales more than doubling in the first quarter of the year.</p><p>“The tide appears to have turned at Tesla, and Europe at least appears to be moving on, or back to legacy manufacturers that have caught up,” Mr. Schmidt said.</p><p>Last month, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">Tesla</a> reported a profit drop of 71 percent in the first three months of the year, Mr. Musk, said he would spend less time in Washington and focus more on managing his companies.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
