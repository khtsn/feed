		<p>Ok am I crazy or is this just like ... enforced because he has no game. Like I haven&#39;t gotten deep into it but he doesn&#39;t seem to say anything outrageous or like rapey, it&#39;s just that he is awkward and keeps shooting half court shots at random women.</p>

</div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4725478">
		
		
		<p>Can he still coach the team, but not attend any event and matches? It will be just fine if it&#39;s true, elevated can be with the team during matches and rest is unchanged.</p>
