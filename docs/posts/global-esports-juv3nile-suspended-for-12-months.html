		<p>How on earth has he harassed them man? like i don&#39;t get the argument, i get he dm&#39;ed them but weren&#39;t the women 18 and above? and from the ss i didn&#39;t really find that bad, like he has L rizz that is true.</p>

		<p>what juv3nile did is considered harassment by riot and it isn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúL rizz‚Äù </p>

			<p>the context of zellsis saying the r word is that he said it as a joke to his friend lmfao</p>

		<p>oh my point is just that riot has a habit of selective outrage, what about sinatra?</p>

	<div data-post-id="4725624">
		
		
		<p>That is what my point is, it was the selective outrage of the community and riot just followed on it rather than having a transparent investigation they decided to ban him and said post that they will have an investigation.</p>

			<p>An investigation for saying retard but not an investigation for being sexual/weird in random girls Twitter DMs? </p>
<p>I think you&#39;re delusional. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re implying that Riot has a secret vendetta against Juvenile, if a coach/player is messaging people like that it is extremely suspicious,. </p>		</div>

			<p>So you are cool with him saying retard? huh?</p>
<p>and I don&#39;t mind him getting banned for sexually harassing, if he has done it he should be banned for it but jordon/marshall shouldn&#39;t get away with their stuff too.</p>		</div>

</div></div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4725478">
		
		
		<p>Can he still coach the team, but not attend any event and matches? It will be just fine if it&#39;s true, elevated can be with the team during matches and rest is unchanged.</p>

		<p>People saying he just had bad rizz but some of the dms (particularly this one <a href="https://x.com/xoskizzy/status/1902548570282025242" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/xoskizzy/status/1902548570282025242</a>) go far, far past the line of sexual harassment. It&#39;s also very questionable to offer to fly out girls you&#39;ve never met or had any prior interactions with, unprompted when you have a relative position of power in the community. No one can speak for him regarding his intentions but that&#39;s a recipe for extremely inappropriate situations where the girl involved has few options to leave and few options to speak out against someone with higher standing than her if something does happen. At the very least that would make him very irresponsible and lacking in self control and he could use a little time away and some professionalism training.</p>
