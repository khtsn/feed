</span> head coach <span data-ref-id="1">Preston		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10075/juv3nile">Juv3nile</a>&#34;
		Dornon</span> for 12 months beginning April 4, 2025 for potential breaches of its Esports Global Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>The announcement stated that Juv3nile will &#34;be suspended from all Riot-sanctioned esport competitions for 12 months, and he will be required to complete an executive training focused on conduct, respect, and professionalism.&#34;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://x.com/GlobalEsportsIn/status/1908026006012833813" target="_blank">statement</a> from Global Esports said: &#34;We respect and support Riot&#39;s decision fully. At Global Esports, we believe that accountability and integrity are non-negotiable. No matter how difficult or unfortunate a situation may be, the standards of conduct and professionalism — both inside and outside the game — must be upheld at all times, by coaches, staff &amp; players.</p>

<p>With Juv3nile out of Global&#39;s coaching booth for the next twelve months, their coaching staff has been reduced to assistant coach <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/46598/elevated">
		Elevated	</a>
</span>, and performance coach <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/52964/patathor8">
		Patathor8	</a>
</span>. Should no head coach be signed before the team&#39;s next match, it is believed that Elevated will assume head coaching duties.</p>

<p>With just over two days until their next match at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/champions-tour-2025-pacific-stage-1/group-stage" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 1</a> against <span data-ref-id="4">

		<p>How on earth has he harassed them man? like i don&#39;t get the argument, i get he dm&#39;ed them but weren&#39;t the women 18 and above? and from the ss i didn&#39;t really find that bad, like he has L rizz that is true.</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4725553">
		
		
		<p>what juv3nile did is considered harassment by riot and it isn’t just “L rizz” </p>

		<div>
			
			<p>the context of zellsis saying the r word is that he said it as a joke to his friend lmfao</p>
<p>also asking girls to fly them out and for CNC isnt harrasment??</p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>

	<div data-post-id="4725576">
		
		
		<p>oh my point is just that riot has a habit of selective outrage, what about sinatra?</p>

		<p>sinatraa was received a 6 month suspension</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4725624">
		
		
		<p>That is what my point is, it was the selective outrage of the community and riot just followed on it rather than having a transparent investigation they decided to ban him and said post that they will have an investigation.</p>

	<div data-post-id="4726035">
		
		
		<p>You don&#39;t call retarded people retarded, you call your friends retarded. Grow a spine if you call yourself a gamer coz this is not a kid&#39;s game, this is a game where majority of the audience is of adults and ex CSGO/COD players. And yeah, harassment is worse than calling someone a retard or N-word so shut the hell up @mwafi20</p>

			<p>An investigation for saying retard but not an investigation for being sexual/weird in random girls Twitter DMs? </p>
<p>I think you&#39;re delusional. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re implying that Riot has a secret vendetta against Juvenile, if a coach/player is messaging people like that it is extremely suspicious,. </p>		</div>

		<p>People saying he just had bad rizz but some of the dms (particularly this one <a href="https://x.com/xoskizzy/status/1902548570282025242" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/xoskizzy/status/1902548570282025242</a>) go far, far past the line of sexual harassment. It&#39;s also very questionable to offer to fly out girls you&#39;ve never met or had any prior interactions with, unprompted when you have a relative position of power in the community. No one can speak for him regarding his intentions but that&#39;s a recipe for extremely inappropriate situations where the girl involved has few options to leave and few options to speak out against someone with higher standing than her if something does happen. At the very least that would make him very irresponsible and lacking in self control and he could use a little time away and some professionalism training.</p>

		<p>nah, but most girls that he said those things is because they&#39;re posting what they &#39;wanted&#39; on twitter, so he was just answered and telling what he could do lmao, weird, but nothing wrong tho. he was just giving a shot.</p>
