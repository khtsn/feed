The upheaval has created complications for the central bank, which is still struggling to stamp out stubbornly high inflation and now must contend with a drastically different set of circumstances as it tries to finish off the job without harming what still appears to be a solid labor market.</p><p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250319a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, the Fed noted that “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased” even as it maintained a positive tone about the state of the economy. It said that economic activity continued to expand at a “solid pace” as the unemployment rate “stabilized at a low level.” Inflation, meanwhile, was “somewhat elevated.”</p><p>Officials also shared a new set of economic projections capturing their most comprehensive analysis yet of how their outlook has evolved now that Mr. Trump has begun to implement his economic agenda.</p><p>Most officials still expect interest rates to decline this year to a range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent, as was the case when projections were last published in December. But eight policymakers forecast either no additional cuts or just one. Only two thought the Fed would lower rates by 0.75 percentage points.</p><p>By the end of 2026, most officials expect interest rates to decline by another half point, to a range of 3.25 percent to 3.5 percent, before falling to around 3 percent in 2027.</p><p>Fed officials now see the economy growing only 1.7 percent this year, compared with their initial expectation for a 2.1 percent expansion, and predict the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4 percent. Officials also lifted their forecasts for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, to 2.8 percent. Back in December, they expected it to end the year at 2.5 percent, already a big step up from earlier estimates.</p><p>Underlying these forecasts is a significant degree of uncertainty about how exactly Mr. Trump’s policies will take shape and how businesses and consumers will respond. Those unknowns have reinforced the Fed’s approach to stand pat for the moment. To cut interest rates again, it wants to see either more tangible evidence that inflation is indeed back on track to its 2 percent target, or signs that the economy is starting to deteriorate sharply.</p><p>One of the biggest wild cards is tariffs, which the president has threatened on a scale beyond what many economists and policymakers initially expected. After much flip-flopping, levies on certain imports from Canada, Mexico and China are now in place, along with all foreign steel and aluminum that comes into the United States. Mr. Trump and his advisers are now working on so-called reciprocal tariffs, which are set to be announced on April 2 and aim to match the tariffs that other countries charge on American exports, while also factoring in other penalties like taxes and currency manipulation.</p><p>The fear is that these policies, coupled with Mr. Trump’s efforts to slash government spending and deport immigrants, will not only intensify already sticky price pressures but also knock what has been a remarkably resilient economy off course. Taxes and deregulatory measures could help to prop up growth to some extent, which is why the Fed is primarily focused on the net effect of the government’s agenda.</p><p>Survey data suggests that Americans have already begun to sour on the outlook while also building in higher expectations about inflation, however. In a notable shift, the president and his advisers have repeatedly refused to rule out a recession, an admission that has jolted financial markets. They have also warned that consumer prices may rise temporarily. That combination would put the Fed in an even more difficult position, given its mandate to keep inflation low and stable and the labor market healthy.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, the Fed announced that it would slow the reduction of its roughly $6.8 trillion balance sheet in order to avoid amplifying disruptions that could crop up in funding markets due to the ongoing standoff over the debt ceiling, which limits how much money the government can borrow to meet its financial obligations. The Fed will now cap the amount of Treasury securities it will allow to roll off its balance sheet at $5 billion per month, down from $25 billion. It kept the monthly cap unchanged for mortgage-backed securities. Christopher Waller, a governor, voted against the decision.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="60" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NiNDgyMzc3LTg0YTktNTZkNy1hM2JlLWEzYWU2NTUxM2MzZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/business/fed-interest-rates#stocks-jump-as-fed-stays-on-a-predicted-path" data-source-id="100000010061393"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye"><img alt="Danielle Kaye" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-danielle-kaye/author-danielle-kaye-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-danielle-kaye/author-danielle-kaye-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-danielle-kaye/author-danielle-kaye-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison"><img alt="Joe Rennison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-19T20:12:12.857Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 19, 2025, 4:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="markets-embed-sp" data-id="100000008938528" data-source-id="100000008938528"><div slug="markets-embed-sp" data-sourceid="100000008938528" id="embed-id-100000008938528">

</div></section><p>Stock investors breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday, with Wall Street’s major benchmarks climbing after the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, reiterated that the American economy remained on solid footing, and that the Fed was prepared to react if conditions changed.</p><p>Fed officials acknowledged that economic uncertainty had increased, raising their inflation forecast and lowering projections for growth, but they left interest rates and projections for future cuts to borrowing costs unchanged.</p><div><p>The Fed did announce changes to its balance sheet policy. Beginning in April, it will slow the pace at which it is reducing its roughly $6.8 trillion portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said that the announcement most likely pushed stocks higher, easing concerns about the risks tied to bank reserves.</p><p>“They’ve had a lot of meetings of no changes, and all of sudden they had a meeting where they made a change,” Mr. Pride said. “That change is in the dovish direction, or one that’s supportive of the economy.”</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.1 percent, recouping its losses from Tuesday.</p><p>Wednesday’s gains followed an extended drop for the market over the past month, a wave of selling that had, at one point, left the S&amp;P 500 more than 10 percent below its Feb. 19 peak. Wall Street sentiment has been dampened by concerns that President Trump’s tariffs and a trade war could push prices sharply higher, discourage consumers and damage the economy.</p><p>Leading up to Wednesday’s decision, investors were focused on whether central bankers would express concern about the path forward for the U.S. economy. Fed officials did lower their projections for economic growth this year to 1.7 percent, down from previous forecasts of a 2.1 percent expansion. They also projected modestly higher unemployment and inflation.</p><p>“These changes are consistent with estimates that have been circulating on Wall Street in recent weeks from banks and macroeconomic research boutiques, and should not have a major impact on financial markets in our view as a result,” said Josh Jamner, senior investment analyst at ClearBridge Investments.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="59" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-RW1iZWRkZWRJbnRlcmFjdGl2ZTpueXQ6Ly9lbWJlZGRlZGludGVyYWN0aXZlLzE1MjgwNTlkLWVmZmEtNTljYS04ZDQwLTBjMDAyNjAwOGNjMA=="><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="fed-target-rate-hgthm" data-id="100000010059904" data-source-id="100000010059904"><div slug="fed-target-rate-hgthm" data-sourceid="100000010059904" id="embed-id-100000010059904">

In support of our goals, today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged. We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity. So when we say separating the signal from the noise, that’s just a way of saying that things are highly uncertain and that you’re reading about developments. The news is full of developments of tariffs being put on and taken off, and things like that. That’s — some of that is noise in the sense that it’s not really telling you anything. So I would tell people that the economy seems to be healthy. We understand that sentiment is quite negative at this time. And that probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that’s making big changes in areas of policy. And that’s probably part of it. I do think the underlying unhappiness people have about the economy, though, is more about the price level.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/multimedia/19vid-federal-reserve-tkwp/19vid-federal-reserve-tkwp-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The Trump administration’s tariffs most likely mean “further progress may be delayed” on getting inflation back to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, the central bank’s chair said.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for a second straight meeting. The March meeting was the central bank’s most direct acknowledgment to date that President Trump’s policies are set to have a real impact on the economy, stoking significant uncertainty about where inflation, growth and — ultimately — interest rates are headed. Here are the takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Tariffs took center stage during the news conference with Jerome H. Powell. The Fed chair went as far as saying that tariffs likely mean “further progress may be delayed” on getting inflation back to the central bank’s 2 percent target. That recognition materialized in the higher inflation forecasts that officials penciled into new economic projections. By the end of the year, officials estimate that core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, will stay stuck at 2.8 percent, before declining to 2.2 percent in 2027.</p></li><li><p>Fed officials paired their higher inflation forecast with lower estimates for economic growth, even as they stuck with previous projections that they would be able to lower interest rates by a half point this year, delivering two quarter-point cuts. The range of possible outcomes was wide, however, with eight policymakers forecasting either no additional cuts or just one this year.
