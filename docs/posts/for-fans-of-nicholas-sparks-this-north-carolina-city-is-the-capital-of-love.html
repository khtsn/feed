Sailboats drift by. Canoes can be heard swooshing along, in no particular rush. On a recent sunny day, along the boardwalk of Union Point Park, couples held hands as they walked past ducks bobbing against a soft current. </p><p>Sunlight makes the confluence of rivers sparkle, as if jewels had been tossed across the water. Moonlit at night, the waters beam with a pale tone. Speaking to Southern Living magazine recently, <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/nicholas-sparks-new-bern-recommendations-8747601" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Sparks said</a> that in New Bern, “You just kind of let the day happen to you.

New Bern was a key stop for those fleeing enslavement in the underground railroad; Civil War battles were also fought in the town, and homes that are nearly 200 years old still stand in the area.<span>  </span></p><p>“The world has gone on even as lives have ended, and that’s what makes New Bern romantic,” said Ms. Garren-Flye, who — naturally — also writes romance novels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-23"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-84857/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-84857-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-84857/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-84857-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-88023/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-88023-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-88023/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-88023-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit=""><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-51613/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-51613-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/13/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-51613/nat-atc-NC-new-bern-51613-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>Michelle Garren-Flye, who owns the Next Chapter, a local bookstore, said New Bern&#39;s rich history is a muse for artists.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Of course, for fans of Mr. Sparks, it’s enough just to see the real-life places where their favorite characters went on dates or kissed. There at the Masonic Theatre was where Noah from “The Notebook” (played by Ryan Gosling in the 2004 movie version) thought of his true love, Allie (played by Rachel McAdams). There were “the draping veils of Spanish moss” that Mr. Sparks had written about in “A Bend in the Road,” trees that, in his words, “only added to the feeling that this part of the world hadn’t changed in the last thousand years.”</p><p>Mike Woika, who runs Sparks-themed trolley tours, said fans often keep an eye out for the author during the tours, in case he happens to be picking up a sandwich or running an errand downtown. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Sometimes his novels have prompted permanent moves. Kelly Sorenson Elliott said her love of Sparks novels started after she had a child “because being a mom and a wife, you often don’t have time to yourself, and I kind of wanted something of my own.” </p><p>She would often tell her husband half-jokingly that she wanted to move from upstate New York to New Bern because of Mr. Sparks, even though “we didn’t know anything about the town except from his novels.” </p><p>“You’re going to move next door to Nicholas and stalk him,” her husband would joke. In 2021, they chose Beaufort, N.C., a smaller town 40 miles southeast of New Bern.</p><p>Amy Whitfield, a travel agent in New Bern, said she often helps book clubs find places to stay when Mr. Sparks does signings at a nearby Books-A-Million store. </p><p>“Nicholas Sparks is kind of tame for me — I like the more adventurous, raunchy stuff,” Ms. Whitfield said. “But his movies make me cry!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Amelia Grove, a wedding venue next to the Trent River.

The couple are both real estate agents. </p><p>“Definitely his writing causes curiosity among a lot of his readership,” Mr. Tyson said. “I sold a house to a couple that came here, and their story is like a Nicholas Sparks novel.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>That couple was Larry and Jane Warren. Both had been widowed for years and craving connection in Phoenix. Then their children encouraged them to create accounts on Match.com. After matching online, Larry and Jane, who were in their 60s at the time, went on their first date.</p><p>He ordered scotch. She had wine. They liked to laugh together, and soon they fell in love. Eventually, they wanted to find a new beginning in the Southeast, where they could be closer to water and maybe get married.</p><p>Originally, they had their heart set on another coastal town in North Carolina. But when they landed at New Bern’s airport in 2012 and saw the unified rivers, the regal streets, they were enraptured.</p><p>That same week, Jane recalled telling Larry, “Let’s just get married here.” On a Friday in May, Larry got dressed in his best blazer. Jane put on an off-white dress. Mr. Tyson enlisted a photographer and an officiant. </p><p>The Warrens kissed a little while later on the courthouse steps downtown and went out for scotch and wine, soothed by the sound of the rivers.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.
