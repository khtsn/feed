The tangled groves still weave throughout the Tramuntana mountain range that hugs the Balearic island’s northwest coast, as essential to the scenery as the dusty cliffs that divebomb into the sea. In the middle is Sóller, a lazy coastal town, in a valley inhabited since 4,000 B.C., from which you can drive inland and lose yourself in the solitude of this singular landscape.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inset shelves bordered in wild olive wood and filled with Terra Coll Home ceramics and recycled glassware from the Majorcan shop Can Garanya.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An outdoor shower made of copper piping installed in native rock.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/t-magazine/30tmag-olivegrove-slide-INWM/30tmag-olivegrove-slide-INWM-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/t-magazine/30tmag-olivegrove-slide-INWM/30tmag-olivegrove-slide-INWM-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/t-magazine/30tmag-olivegrove-slide-INWM/30tmag-olivegrove-slide-INWM-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A small building with an open glass door.

The pair, who met in Kyrgyzstan two decades ago, had previously lived for 15 years in New York City, where in 2017 they founded the ceramics line <a href="https://www.instagram.com/terra_coll_home/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Terra Coll Home</a>. Before turning to pottery, Baibabaeva, 38, had worked in fashion and Strang, 45, had been a teacher; when they relocated to Spain, they fully merged their creative, personal and professional lives, raising two children together, developing a rustic-minded interiors business and even sharing an email address, from which they explain, “For us, ‘rustic design’ means unifying the interior of a space with its landscape by using the raw materials from the surrounding land as the primary construction and design elements.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Strang and Baibabaeva leaning against one of the property’s many gnarled trees.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The salvaged limestone floor is from a centuries-old Spanish church.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>To create a sink, the designers hollowed out and mounted a boulder into one of the building’s lime-washed walls.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>Although they renovated their own 300-year-old Majorcan finca 40 minutes southeast according to this principle, then undertook a few residences for clients who wanted a similarly pared-back farmhouse style, they feel the best encapsulation of their aesthetic is now a smaller, more personal project: a stone hut hidden among olive trees 20 minutes north of Sóller.<strong> </strong>As we sat outside the place one early April afternoon, snacking on cheese, fruit and cured meat, Baibabaeva explained that buildings of this type, known colloquially as “olivars,” were once shepherd’s sheds, used to store tools and olives, or to provide momentary shelter from heat and rain for the farmers who’ve tended the region’s steep lunar terraces for more than 1,000 years. The designers wanted to transform the decrepit, 376-square-foot stone-and-earth structure, which they believe is between two and three centuries old, into a livable (for a night or two, that is) off-grid “monastic refuge,” as they describe it, using only locally sourced wood and rock.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sheep roaming the hillside, where Strang and Baibabaeva hope to start producing olive oil in a few years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The cabinets are constructed from old oak cabinetry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>To do so, they started by reorienting the sole room toward the wide views of the Balearic Sea, placing a low, linen-covered bed in the center facing an arched window. Outside, an open-air pavilion approximates a living room, kitchen and washroom; built into stone walls are areas for lounging on umber-colored cushions, cooking on cast-iron burners placed in a makeshift countertop and showering — beneath a curved copper pipe suspended from a boulder. Inside,<strong> </strong>opposite a toilet tucked discreetly into one corner, there’s a sink carved from another boulder found nearby set into one of the earthen walls covered in rough mortar and lime wash and surrounded by rudimentary olive-wood lintels and cabinets made from antique oak flooring. The limestone floor is also old, salvaged from a centuries-old Spanish church and brought<strong>, </strong>slab by slab, on foot up the dirt pathway toward the mountaintop. As Strang saw it, this was always land worked without machinery, so he and Baibabaeva would do it that way themselves.</p></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The outdoor kitchen, with cast-iron burners by Meva.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stone walls and terraces that for centuries have supported the area’s olive cultivation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salva Lopez</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>Despite the elemental appeal of the cabin and its rugged terrain, everything on the property is functional: Though the couple will hike and share meals with friends here, the real draw is the four-and-a-half acre fallow olive orchard, which they’re carefully pruning in order to harvest the fruit for oil in three or so years. A few days after our visit, the couple wrote to clarify something they’ve learned about Majorcan olive cultivation: “Some have said it’s one of the rare instances where humans have improved upon natural beauty.” This century, as production has moved off the mountains, tall pine trees have stolen the sun, causing spiky, low wild olive bushes to scavenge for light and overtake the fruiting trees. Next came large oaks, which can choke the other trees and destroy the terraces themselves, rendering the slopes uninhabitable. “It’s not a loss, or something to grieve,” the couple says. “The time passes.” The only thing we as people can do is hope it happens slowly.</p></div><div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kurt Soller is an editor at large of T, The New York Times Style Magazine.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/22/t-magazine/majorca-home.html">12</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore T Magazine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tackling One of Our Last Taboos: </strong>The artist Camille Henrot has filled a gap in the canon by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/t-magazine/camille-henrot-motherhood-art.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-t-mag&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">investigating the labor of motherhood</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Home That Could Be a Movie Set: </strong>If they ever make a movie about the Hollywood producer Amy Pascal, the ranch house that she shares with her husband, the playwright and retired Times journalist Bernard Weinraub, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/t-magazine/los-angeles-home-amy-pascal.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-t-mag&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">deserves top billing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Danish Pudding That Tastes Like Summertime: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/t-magazine/berry-dessert-recipe-rodgrod-med-flode.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-t-mag&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Rødgrød med fløde</a> takes Mette Hay, a co-founder of the home goods company Hay, back to her grandparents’ garden.
