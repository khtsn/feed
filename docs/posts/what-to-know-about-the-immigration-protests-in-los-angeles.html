His order was an extraordinary escalation that puts Los Angeles squarely at the center of tensions over his administration’s immigration crackdown. Californian Gov. Gavin Newsom said it was “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.”</p><p>The protests on Saturday in downtown Los Angeles and the city of Paramount, about 16 miles south of Los Angeles, were the second consecutive day of demonstrations. In some cases, law enforcement officers used rubber bullets and flash bang grenades against the protesters. </p><p>As of early Sunday, there were no signs of the National Guard troops on streets in the Los Angeles area. The protests had died down but organizers have called for more demonstrations later on Sunday. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what to know:</p><h2 id="link-6e952e59">How have the protests developed? </h2><p>Demonstrations broke out in the Los Angeles area on Friday and continued on Saturday.</p><p>The raids appear to be part of a new phase of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, with officials saying they will increasingly focus on workplaces. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 121 immigrants across Los Angeles on Friday, according to a Department of Homeland Security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>The police had said earlier in the day that demonstrations in the city were peaceful. Some of the protests in other areas on Saturday were in Paramount, a city about 16 miles south of downtown Los Angeles that has a large Latino population, were more confrontational. </p><p>Demonstrators in some cases clashed with law enforcement officers. Some hurled rocks at police officers, who responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department <a href="https://local.nixle.com/alert/11646767/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> protesters exhibited “violent behavior” and that “intervention became necessary.”</p><p>The Los Angeles Police Department detained a number of protesters near the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday. </p><h2 id="link-7640cd99">What is the National Guard?</h2><p>The National Guard is the only branch of the U.S. military that can be deployed by both state governors and the president. It operates similarly to the Army reserve force, with its members attending regular trainings. They can be called into full active duty service but normally hold other jobs. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The National Guard is often used during extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires. The last time it was called upon by the president in response to a civil disturbance was during the 1992 Los Angeles riots that erupted after four white police officers who were filmed beating Rodney King, a Black man, were acquitted, according to the National Guard website. </p><p>A top government official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/national-guard-los-angeles-deploy.html?smid=url-share" title="">said</a> late Saturday that the troops would arrive within 24 hours. </p><h2 id="link-64f1d2d2">What have officials said? </h2><p>Trump administration officials have criticized the state’s political leadership over the protests, while California’s Democratic lawmakers blasted President Trump’s order as an inappropriate use of power. </p><p>Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said on social media that the protests were an <a href="https://x.com/StephenM/status/1931526026330316971" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Insurrection.”</a> </p><p>Although some demonstrations have been unruly, local authorities in Los Angeles County did not indicate on Saturday that they needed federal assistance.</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, immediately rebuked Mr. Trump’s decision, and said the president wanted a spectacle.</p><p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the National Guard’s presence would “not be helpful.” The city is capable of handling protests, she said, adding that she has been in contact with White House officials and Thomas Homan, the border czar.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
