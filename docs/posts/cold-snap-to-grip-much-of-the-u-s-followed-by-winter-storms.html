Icing is also expected, with sleet and freezing rain forecast for eastern Kansas and the Ozarks. These hazards may extend into the Tennessee and low Ohio Valleys through the weekend, and parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains could experience icing by Sunday.</p><p>On Sunday and Monday, the risk of severe weather, including strong winds and lightning, could extend to parts of eastern Texas, much of Louisiana and Mississippi, into southern Arkansas and possibly western Tennessee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Next week the <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/threats/threats.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Climate Prediction Center’s hazards outlook</a> predicts a high risk of much-below-normal temperatures for the Southeastern United States and portions of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. Heavy snow is also possible for the Great Lakes region and portions of the Southern Plains through the Mid-Atlantic toward the end of the week.</p><p>Social media buzz about the chance of a foot of snow in Atlanta has drawn some doubts from local forecasters. Dylan Lusk, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Atlanta, <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=FFC&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> that “ingredients to get snow in the south are fickle,” and that for such a scenario to unfold, two weather systems would need to converge in a unique way. “Experience tells me not to get my hopes up for snow just yet. Stay tuned to the forecast!”</p><p> The National Weather Service echoed this uncertainty in its latest advisory, saying that the timing and trajectory of the storm track will be key factors in identifying areas that could get the most significant weather. </p><p>While the possibility of snow next week remains less predictable, forecasters are much more certain about the cold.</p><p>“This has the potential to be a fairly significant Arctic outbreak,” said meteorologist Scott Kleebauer with the Weather Prediction Center. “The one thing for sure is that it’s going to get cold, and it’s going to last a fairly long period of time.”</p><p>Judson Jones<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
