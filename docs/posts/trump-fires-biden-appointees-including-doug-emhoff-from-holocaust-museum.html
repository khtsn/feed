Biden Jr.’s appointees to the board that oversees the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, including Douglas Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, and other senior Biden White House officials.</p><p>“Today, I was informed of my removal from the United States Holocaust Memorial Council,” Mr. Emhoff said in a statement on Tuesday. “Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized. To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.”</p><p>Mr. Emhoff is Jewish and an outspoken critic of the rise in antisemitism.</p><p>“On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council is terminated, effective immediately,” Mary Sprowls, who works in the White House Presidential Personnel Office, wrote in an email to officials on Tuesday morning. “Thank you for your service.”</p><p>The other officials who were dismissed include Ron Klain, Mr. Biden’s first chief of staff; Tom Perez, the former labor secretary and senior adviser to Mr. Biden; and Susan Rice, the national security adviser to former President Barack Obama and Mr. Biden’s top domestic policy adviser; and Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser to Jill Biden, the former first lady.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is a sad day because our mission at the council has always been nonpartisan,” Mr. Perez said in a brief phone call.</p><p>Representatives for President Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the terminations. A spokesman for the museum did not immediately have a comment.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
