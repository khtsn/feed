Frankie Muniz, who played Malcolm Wilkerson, helped tease the comeback in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/disneyplus/p/DDhrdG6vaVV/?img_index=4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videos posted</a> on Disney+ social media accounts.</p><p>“I have been waiting for this moment for 18 years,” Muniz said in one video, referring to the show’s finale in 2006. “Let’s find out where Malcolm and his family are now.”</p><p>The post also featured videos of Bryan Cranston, who went on to star in “Breaking Bad,” and Jane Kaczmarek, who will be reprising their roles as Malcolm’s parents, Hal and Lois.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“What a delight that I get to yell at that kid again,” Kaczmarek said. “We are very, very excited about coming back together.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/malcolm-in-the-middle-revival-frankie-muniz-bryan-cranston-1236202546/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to Deadline</a>, Linwood Boomer, the show’s creator, will be a writer on the four episodes. Ken Kwapis, one of the directors of the original show, will direct all four episodes.</p><p>The new episodes follow Malcolm’s return home with his daughter to help his parents celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary.</p><p>It’s unclear whether Christopher Kennedy Masterson, Justin Berfield and Erik Per Sullivan, who played Muniz’s brothers on the show, will reprise their roles. Sullivan, who played the youngest brother, Dewey, left Hollywood after the show ended.</p><p>“Malcolm in the Middle,” which aired on Fox from 2000 to 2006, tracked Malcolm, a young genius, navigating life with his dysfunctional family of scheming, bickering brothers and unconventional parents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In just its second week, the show became the most-watched comedy on television at the time, drawing 23.2 million viewers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/24/business/the-malcolm-sensibility-new-sitcom-s-early-success-may-spawn-host-of-imitators.html" title="">The New York Times reported in 2000</a>.</p><p>Unlike other sitcoms at the time that were filmed with multiple cameras in front of a studio audience, “Malcolm in the Middle” was produced like a movie and used a single camera for a more realistic look. It also lacked a laugh track.</p><p>But beyond aesthetics, “Malcolm in the Middle” was built on a cast of characters that were unpredictable and funny, with Malcolm often serving as the narrator and speaking directly to the camera.</p><p>The show was nominated for 33 Emmys and won seven times in categories including outstanding directing for a comedy series and outstanding writing for a comedy series.</p><p>Muniz largely stepped away from acting after the show ended and went on to become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5889129/2024/11/01/frankie-muniz-nascar-dale-earnhardt-movies/" title="">a professional racecar driver</a>.
