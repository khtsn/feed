Tisch.</p><p>The police identified the man, who has connections to Switzerland and Miami, as William Duplessie. He had spent days negotiating his surrender with the Police Department after the arrest on Friday of two others, John Woeltz, a cryptocurrency investor, and Beatrice Folchi, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter. Ms. Folchi was quickly released and her prosecution was deferred, one of the officials said.</p><p>“We know he is going to be charged, with Mr. Woeltz, with kidnapping and false imprisonment of an associate,” Commissioner Tisch said in an interview on Fox 5 of Mr. Duplessie, shortly after he turned himself in.</p><p>The episode burst into public view on Friday morning when the victim, an Italian man, escaped from the lavish, 17-room townhouse in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan where he had been held captive and flagged down a traffic agent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The victim, Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, and Mr. Woeltz had ties to a crypto hedge fund in New York, according to an internal police report relayed by a third law enforcement official.</p><p>But Mr. Carturan and Mr. Woeltz fell out over money and Mr. Carturan flew to Italy, according to the report. Soon after, Mr. Woeltz persuaded him to return to New York.</p><p>Mr. Carturan arrived at the townhouse, at 38 Prince Street, on May 6, where he was captured and held by Mr. Woeltz and Ms. Folchi, according to the report. They wanted the password to a Bitcoin wallet worth millions, the report said.</p><p>After his escape, Mr. Carturan told the police a harrowing story of abuse, torture and threats on his life, in which his captors held a gun to his head and demanded the password to his crypto wallet, according to the report.</p><p>As he rebuffed their demands, the assaults escalated, he said, and he was carried to the top of the five-story home and suspended over the ledge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The case comes amid a rash of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-industry-robberies-attacks-32c2867a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jarring attacks</a> in the United States and around the globe in which high-ranking crypto executives and their family members have been kidnapped or assaulted for ransom.</p><p>The so-called “wrench attacks,” so named because of their brutish techniques, have become a growing concern in the world of digital currency, as more investors store sensitive information on physical devices, instead of digitally, in an effort to avoid hackers.</p><p>The trend has become especially troubling in France, where several prominent crypto entrepreneurs have been targeted in the past few months. In January, the father of a crypto influencer was found in the trunk of a car, bound and covered in gasoline, after the family was attacked at their home in eastern France, according to <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/police-justice/pere-d-un-influenceur-en-cryptomonnaie-enleve-et-sequestre-une-information-judiciaire-ouverte_AN-202501170804.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">French media reports</a>.
