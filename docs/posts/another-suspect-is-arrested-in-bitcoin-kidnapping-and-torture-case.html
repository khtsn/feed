Tisch said.</p><p>The police identified the man, who has connections to Switzerland and Miami, as William Duplessie, 33. He had spent days negotiating his surrender with the Police Department after the arrest on Friday of two other suspects, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter.</p><p>One of the people arrested on Friday, John Woeltz, 37, a cryptocurrency investor, faces kidnapping, assault and firearms charges. The other, Beatrice Folchi, 24, who was initially charged by the police with kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment, was quickly released and her prosecution was deferred, one of the officials said.</p><p>Mr. Duplessie “is going to be charged, with Mr. Woeltz, with kidnapping and false imprisonment of an associate,” Commissioner Tisch said Tuesday in an interview on Fox 5.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Shortly before 11:30 a.m., Mr. Duplessie, in handcuffs and flanked by two detectives, was walked out of a precinct house on East 21st Street in Manhattan. Wearing a white polo shirt and black pants, Mr. Duplessie did not respond to questions as he was placed in a waiting police cruiser.</p><p>The episode burst into public view on Friday morning when the victim, an Italian man named Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, escaped from a lavish, 17-room townhouse in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan, where he was being held captive, and flagged down a traffic agent.</p><p>Mr. Carturan and Mr. Woeltz had ties to a crypto hedge fund in New York, according to an internal police report relayed by a third law enforcement official. But Mr. Carturan and Mr. Woeltz fell out over money and Mr. Carturan flew to Italy, according to the report. Soon after, Mr. Woeltz persuaded him to return to New York.</p><p>Mr. Carturan arrived at the townhouse, at 38 Prince Street, on May 6, where he was captured and held by Mr. Woeltz and Ms. Folchi, the report said. They wanted the password to a Bitcoin wallet worth millions, the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The townhouse from which Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan escaped after nearly three weeks of captivity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jackie Molloy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Carturan was bound with electrical cords and whipped with a gun, according to the report. The attackers also submerged his feet in water and used a Taser gun to jolt him with electricity.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Inside the townhouse, investigators discovered photographs of Mr. Carturan being tortured, several guns, a ballistic vest and broken furniture — much of it on the third floor of the home, the report said.</p><p>Mr. Carturan said that as he rebuffed his captors’ demands, the assaults escalated, and he was carried to the top of the five-story home and suspended over the ledge.</p><p>After his escape, Mr. Carturan told the police the harrowing story, according to the report.</p><p>Mr. Duplessie’s lawyer, Sanford Talkin, declined to comment, as did Mr. Woeltz’s lawyer, Wayne Ervin Gosnell Jr. Mr. Woeltz’s mother also declined to comment.</p><p>Efforts to reach a lawyer for Ms. Folchi were unsuccessful.</p><p>The case comes amid a rash of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-industry-robberies-attacks-32c2867a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jarring attacks</a> around the globe in which high-ranking crypto executives and their relatives have been kidnapped or assaulted for ransom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The so-called “wrench attacks,” so named because of their brutish techniques, have become a growing concern in the world of digital currency, as more investors store sensitive information on physical devices, instead of digitally, in an effort to avoid hackers.</p><p>The trend has become especially troubling in France, where several prominent crypto entrepreneurs have been targeted in the past few months. In January, the father of a crypto influencer was found in the trunk of a car, bound and covered in gasoline, after the family was attacked at their home in eastern France, according to <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/police-justice/pere-d-un-influenceur-en-cryptomonnaie-enleve-et-sequestre-une-information-judiciaire-ouverte_AN-202501170804.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">French media reports</a>.</p><p>A few weeks later, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/world/europe/france-crypto-kidnapping.html" title="">founder of French cryptocurrency company</a> was abducted from his home and had one of his fingers cut off by his captors.</p><p>The main suspect in the New York case had come a long way to the NoLIta townhouse, which was recently listed for rent at $75,000 a month.</p><p>Mr. Woeltz grew up in Paducah, Ky., a small town about 140 miles from Nashville, according to <a href="https://www.paducahsun.com/news/crypto-investor-from-paducah-charged-in-nyc-kidnapping-case/article_33911113-5d15-5c36-b963-9a462dfa9d87.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview he gave to The Paducah Sun</a>, a local newspaper, in 2020.

At the time, Mr. Woeltz said he was the managing director of Silicon River Capital, an investment fund focused on blockchain technology.</p><p>“When I grew up in Paducah, there just wasn’t a clear path for me locally in tech,” Mr. Woeltz said in the interview. “After graduating from UK, I packed my bags and headed for Silicon Valley, because that’s what you had to do then to succeed in the industry.”</p><p>In recent years, Kentucky has become a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/kentuckys-bitcoin-boom-has-gone-bust/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">player</a> in the cryptocurrency mining industry, and Mr. Woeltz was tapped to join a working group under its state office of technology.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The group was set up by Kentucky lawmakers to use blockchain technology to protect natural gas pipelines, telecommunications and other infrastructure, according to its 2024 annual <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/AgencyReports/IJC/TSBIT/C/BG/2024%20Blockchain%20Working%20Group%20Annual%20Report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>.
