His garden gnome holds up a sign that reads “Fly Eagles Fly.”</p><p>You may be beginning to suspect that Mr. Bergner is a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, who are set to face the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl on Sunday.</p><p>Fandom comes in all shapes and sizes, but Mr. Bergner’s love for his favorite team is mostly expressed through a collection of jerseys large enough to outfit an entire N.F.L. draft class.</p><p>He opened the door to his home in Bristol, Pa., on his 145th straight day wearing a different one of the team’s jerseys — a saga that has drawn the attention of thousands of fans on social media. The team’s playoff run had come nowhere close to exhausting his deep bench of team apparel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’ve got 300 jerseys, and only two suits,” Mr. Bergner, 55, said.</p><p>For the past 13 years, Mr. Bergner has worn a different jersey for each day of the N.F.L. season, usually paired with a coordinating Eagles hat.

He browses eBay for good deals on jerseys or picks them up at flea markets or from the team store. Other collectors often approach him to buy his jerseys. He turns them all down.</p><p>“I have a problem,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Bergner grew up in Bristol and attended his first Eagles game in 1980, against the Oakland Raiders. He never played football but wore a Ron Jaworski jersey throughout his teenage years.</p><p>He began seriously collecting jerseys in his mid-20s. His acquisitions trace a line through Eagles history, from the halfback Steve Van Buren, who played for the team from 1944 to 1951, to the running back Saquon Barkley, who thrived in 2024 after coming to the team as a free agent.</p><p>In a sea of green, he also has a red-white-and-blue Pro Bowl jersey and a bumblebee-yellow jersey that the team wore to commemorate its 75th anniversary season. (The latter <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfls-worst-ever-uniforms-color-225237826.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">topped one list</a> of the league’s most hideous uniforms.)</p><p>Like many Eagles fans, Mr. Bergner still resents the team’s change in jersey colors in 1996, from a vibrant Kelly green to a more muted teal that the franchise calls “midnight green.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bergner’s collection is not limited to jerseys, or to the current era. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He is among those who <a href="https://billypenn.com/2023/04/01/eagles-kelly-green-uniforms-history-philadelphia-football/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">credit the change</a> to the owner Jeffrey Lurie’s wife at the time, Christina, who is rumored to have disliked the color. “I <em>loved</em> Kelly green,” he said. “Kelly green should be the standard color.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He stuck with the team through triumphs and embarrassing defeats. He has a tattoo on his calf commemorating the miserable 1998 season, when the Eagles won only three games out of 16. When the franchise won its first Super Bowl, after the 2017 season, he could not contain himself.</p><p>“I’m on the floor crying, because I thought I would never see that in my life,” he said. Mr. Bergner and his two daughters — both born on game days — got matching tattoos of the Vince Lombardi Trophy soon after.</p><p>He thinks it is important to remind a younger generation that Eagles fandom has not always been a picnic.</p><p>“These kids don’t know what it’s like,” he said. Recent Eagles fans are accustomed to N.F.C. championship games and Super Bowl rematches, while older fans had a different experience. “We were going in October — we knew the season was over.”</p><p>This season, as the Eagles cruised to a 14-3 record, Mr. Bergner has been stopped for selfies at tailgates and recognized as “the jersey guy.” After a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/eagles/eagles-jersey-hat-memorabilia-collection-tiktok-20250121.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">profile in the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, some fans have told him they think he is the team’s good-luck charm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>He wouldn’t go that far. “We’re family, and you shouldn’t put one person above the other,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In addition to the current team, Mr. Bergner’s collection pays tribute to star players of the past like Michael Vick, DeSean Jackson and Donovan McNabb. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Bergner is confident that the team will win the Super Bowl, despite its formidable opponents in Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. He plans to watch at a friend’s house, wearing a Kelly green Saquon Barkley jersey that was a Christmas present from his wife.</p><p>Andrea likes that he wears jerseys so often because they make him easier to pick out in public, she said. She talked him out of wearing one exactly once: for his nephew’s wedding, on a Sunday in October 2017.</p><p>“I was going to wear it under my suit,” Mr. Bergner said. “She’s like: ‘You are wearing a tuxedo. Can you please not wear the jersey underneath?’”</p><p>He settled for an Eagles necktie.
