More than a century later, Marcell’s descendants say they want them back.</p><p>A sense that the family was cheated out of the collection, including 17th-century Italian and Flemish oil paintings, has been passed from one generation to the next, said Lauren Nile, one of Marcell’s great-granddaughters.</p><p>“I’ve been hearing about these paintings since I was a very young child,” she said, recalling her parents poring over family photographs at the dining room table with her great-uncle, Marshall Marcell Jr., when he came to visit in the 1960s. “I remember him saying, ‘One day, we’re going to get our family’s paintings back, and when we do, our ship is going to come in.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I’ve been hearing about these paintings since I was a very young child,” said Lauren Nile, second from right, who is one of Marcell’s great-granddaughters and pictured with her siblings.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren Nile</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In recent years, officials with what is now the Louisiana State Museums have said that the dealer’s family was probably not compensated fairly for his art.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2005, its curator of visual arts at the time, Beth Antoine, responded to Nile’s claim to the artworks by describing their acquisition as “an unusual story and one that would not happen today.” One of her successors, Richard Anthony Lewis, wrote in a 2014 conference presentation that was shared with Marcell’s descendants that he and his colleagues “agree to assume” that the family’s treatment “was a historical injustice.”</p><p>The Louisiana State Museums, a statewide system of 10 museums and historical sites, have not offered to return the paintings. Doing so could violate <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=84290" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a state law</a> that says artworks can be removed from a museum’s collection only if they “have lost their physical integrity, usefulness, authenticity or relationship to the museum’s purposes.” An exemption could be granted by the Louisiana Legislature, said Christopher A. Marinello, who is the founder of Art Recovery International and working with Marcell’s heirs.</p><p>There are protocols to guide museums in restituting art that was looted from victims of Nazi persecution or sold under duress. Some U.S. museums have also repatriated objects taken from former colonies; others have returned items to Native American groups. But the Marcell heirs do not fit into a category for which precedents and guidelines exist.</p><p>Marinello said museum officials have been receptive to his proposal that some of the paintings be put on display in an exhibition devoted to Marcell, whose name has not previously been included on labels when the works have been shown.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Other artwork once owned by Marcell includes “Count Louis Philippe Joseph de Roffignac,” a painting of the last French-born mayor of New Orleans that is attributed to John L.

Boqueta de Woiseri.</p><p>Nile said her family was “receptive to the idea of an exhibit” of these works and others, but with “the important caveat that we see it as only one possible part of a larger, and what we hope will be amicable, resolution to this multigenerational injustice.”</p><p>Marinello said in an email that the exhibition was one area the heirs and the museum agreed on: “It would honor Marshall Marcell and, at the same time, bring attention and visitors.” David Dalia, a lawyer for the museum system, referred questions about a potential exhibition to Barry C. Landry, a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, who did not respond to a request for comment about it.</p><p>In an earlier email, Landry said the museum system had 34 items in its collection that were originally lent by Marcell. Museum employees, he wrote, “are relying on records from the early 20th century to better understand Mr. Marcell’s story and the provenance of his works.”</p><p>“While records more than 100 years old are seldom straightforward, we have not found reason to doubt the state purchased these works,” he wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Marshall Marcell was born in Louisiana in 1856, nearly a decade before the abolition of slavery, and Nile said it was likely he was born enslaved. The family knew little about his life until recently, she said, when one of Marcell’s great-grandsons <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/536a52b0-e5b3-013a-d5fc-0242ac110004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unearthed a document in the New York Public Library’s digital collections</a> that was written in the 1930s by Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, a bibliophile and curator.</p><p>Schomburg wrote that Marcell’s trade as a mattress maker gave him access to “the homes of old settlers” and “provided him with the opportunity of seeing and admiring the old furniture, oil paintings and bric-a-brac that decorated those beautiful old homes.” He was inspired to collect, Schomburg wrote, “and as the elder members of those families were fastly passing to the great beyond, the younger generations were discarding those old relics for newer creations in house decorations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The museum system says none of the paintings owned by Marcell are currently on view. They include “Spring (Festoon of Flowers),” a 16th-century painting attributed to the school of Giuseppe Arcimboldo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Louisiana State Museum</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>It helped that the barrier to becoming a collector was lower then. “At the time, the 1880s to 1900, this stuff was cheap as dirt,” Lewis, the former Louisiana State Museums visual arts curator, said in an interview.</p><p>By the late 1890s, Schomburg wrote, Marcell “had assembled as fine” a collection “of old oil paintings as the South had ever seen.” He owned a shop on Chartres Street in New Orleans and “kept an elaborate library of books on the life and works of the old masters which aided him in recognizing meritious works of art.” Marcell visited Europe in 1898 “for the purpose of studying the great collections there” and, in 1899, “exhibited his entire collection to the people of New Orleans,” Schomburg wrote, without giving details.</p><p>The leaders of the Louisiana State Museum were impressed. In its first biennial report, the board of curators wrote that, in March 1910, “the museum came into possession through loan from Marshall Marcell, of New Orleans, of 60 oil paintings.” These included “many rare and beautiful specimens of old Italian, Flemish and French masters and which are undoubtedly genuine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In her 2005 letter to Nile, Antoine said the museum agreed in 1910 to pay Marcell an “advance” of just under $1,500 in return for the loan of the paintings, which would be displayed at the museum for at least two years and until the debt was paid with 8 percent interest.</p><p>Marcell died in 1912 or 1913 and his sons, Marshall Jr. and Zeno, could not afford to pay their father’s outstanding debt, according to Lewis. They filed a lawsuit demanding that the museum turn over the artworks to them, but a judge ruled in 1914 that the works should instead be auctioned to pay off the debt.</p><p>The artworks sold at an auction hosted by the museum for $914.50, a sum described as “very low” by Isaac M. Cline, an honorary curator and a contemporary of Marcell’s who is cited in Lewis’s presentation. Marcell had estimated the value of his entire collection at $6,000, according to the minutes of a museum board meeting.</p><p>The museum purchased all but nine of the artworks at the auction, agreeing to abandon its claim to the outstanding balance of the loan and declaring itself “absolved from all claims for pictures lost or stolen” from Marcell’s collection.</p><p>With this agreement, the museum secured nearly all of Marcell’s collection at a small fraction of its value and recovered most of the advance it had paid him, while framing the deal as a favor to his heirs.</p><p>“As much as I would like to return to 1914 and change the outcome, or to make reparations,” Lewis wrote in his 2014 presentation, “as a curator, my hands are tied, by policy, legal issues and so forth.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>LeAnne Weill, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana State Museums, said none of the paintings lent by Marcell are currently on display. Marinello said the location of 36 works that appeared in the first inventory of the loan is unknown.</p><p>Marcell’s heirs say there is no evidence that Marshall Marcell Jr. and Zeno Marcell — whom the Louisiana State Museum referred to in documents at the time as “the boys,” a demeaning term for Black men — challenged the museum after the court case.</p><p>“The fact that my uncles were African Americans attempting to negotiate with a Louisiana state institution in the early 20th century put them at an extreme social disadvantage,” Nile said.</p><p>Without action by the Louisiana Legislature, an effort by the family to pursue the matter in court would be unlikely to succeed, Marinello said, because the statutes of limitation for any legal claim expired decades ago.</p><p>“For Holocaust-era art losses, there are international guidelines and national structures to help heirs recover works wrongfully taken from their forefathers,” he said, referring to the Washington Principles, which set standards for the handling of looted art in public collections.</p><p>“But in this situation,” he said, “there are no guidelines like the Washington Principles that would apply. It’s a unique case. Still, we are hopeful that the museum board sees fit to right this historic wrong.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
