Mr. Nantwi, other inmates said, was bloodied, swollen and unrecognizable after the beating.</p><p>An 11-count grand jury indictment was unsealed on Wednesday charging two officers, Jonah Levi and Caleb Blair, with Mr. Nantwi’s murder. They and three other officers were charged with manslaughter in the first degree and gang assault, and two more were charged with second-degree manslaughter. Eight of the officers were charged with trying to cover up the attack. The officers, who pleaded not guilty, are due back in court on May 23.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The charges were announced by William J. Fitzpatrick, the Onondaga County district attorney, who was appointed special prosecutor in the case.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A family photo of Mr. Nantwi.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“As a result of the numerous beatings by defendants and their fellow correctional officers, incarcerated individual Messiah Nantwi died due to massive head trauma and numerous other injuries to his body,” the indictment said. The officers had “demonstrated depraved indifference” to his life, according to the indictment.</p><p>It is the second time in four months that New York State corrections officers have faced criminal charges in the death of an inmate. The other inmate, Robert Brooks, 43, was fatally beaten by guards in December at the Marcy Correctional Facility, directly across the road from where Mr. Nantwi was beaten.</p><p>Ten officers were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/nyregion/robert-brooks-corrections-officers-charged-murder.html" title="">criminally charged</a> in Mr. Brooks’s death, six of them with murder, after they were captured on body-worn cameras beating and choking him in the prison’s infirmary.</p><p>Mr. Nantwi’s death came amid a deepening crisis in the state prison system. Thousands of corrections officers in most of New York’s 42 prisons had left their assigned posts in protest of what they said were hazardous working conditions, taking part in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/nyregion/new-york-prison-strike-deal.html" title="">a series of wildcat strikes that lasted three weeks</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some prisoners’ rights groups had accused the officers of attempting to distract attention from the beating death of Mr. Brooks and the system’s deep-seated culture of brutality.</p><p>Mr. Nantwi, who had been serving a five-year term for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital early on March 1. Nine prisoners interviewed by The New York Times, seven of whom agreed to have their names used, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/nyregion/prison-inmate-death-marcy.html" title="">said Mr. Nantwi had been viciously beaten by up to 15 corrections officers and their supervisors</a>.</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul said in March that “extremely disturbing conduct” had preceded Mr. Nantwi’s death.</p><p>In addition to Officers Levi and Blair, Officers Thomas Eck, Craig Klemick and Daniel Burger were charged with first-degree manslaughter and gang assault. Sgts. David Ferrone and Francis Chandler were charged with second-degree manslaughter, and three others face lesser charges.</p><p>“This indictment signals that violence and lawlessness in our prisons will not be tolerated,” said Earl Ward, a lawyer for Mr. Nantwi’s father, Patterson Nantwi Jr.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Ward said he hoped that Mr. Fitzpatrick would pursue the case aggressively and “make sure justice is done.”</p><p>Members of the National Guard, who had been deployed to replace striking officers at Mid-State, a medium-security prison, were preparing to conduct a security check in a housing area to make sure all prisoners were accounted for, according to the nine interviewed by The Times.</p><p>The Guard members had received little training on how to deal with and interact with prisoners, the indictment said. Shortly before 11 a.m., the guardsmen requested assistance in dealing with “an unknown issue with an incarcerated individual,” the indictment said. Once the officers arrived, they were directed to a room where they encountered Mr. Nantwi.</p><p>Mr. Nantwi had become emotional when the count was set to begin and had left for the shower area of the dorm, where he could be heard crying, the prisoners who spoke to The Times said. One prisoner, Rodney Richards, 43, said that Mr. Nantwi appeared to be having a disagreement with the Guard members and had refused to go to his cubicle. Several prisoners said he had stopped taking his psychiatric medications.</p><p>When the officers arrived, they made little to no effort to understand the reason for the call, the indictment said. Mr. Nantwi had his hands raised, and when he protested being handcuffed and restrained, he grabbed the vest of Officer Joshua Bartlett. The assault began immediately.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Officers Levi and Blair began beating Mr. Nantwi, striking him on his body and head with their boots “for no legitimate law enforcement purpose,” the indictment said. Officers Eck, Klemick and Burger also participated in the beating, using their fists, batons and boots.</p><p>The attack worsened after Mr. Nantwi bit the hands of Officers Blair and Eck, the indictment said. Sergeants Ferrone and Chandler, both supervisors, failed to intervene during the five-minute assault.</p><p>One prisoner whose cubicle was near Mr. Nantwi’s recalled the sounds of the blows to his body.</p><p>“He was screaming,” the prisoner, Jordan McLin, 26, said at the time. “I kept hearing ‘stop resisting’ and at one point you can just hear something being hit.”</p><p>Mr. Nantwi had begged the prison guards to stop beating him, said another prisoner, Aaron Perry, 34.</p><p>“He said, ‘I didn’t do anything,’” Mr. Perry recalled. “‘You’re really hurting me. Stop!’”</p><p>Some of the prisoners said the guards did not appear to be wearing body-worn cameras; others said a few of the officers were wearing them, but they were turned off. Four of the prisoners interviewed said they saw a corrections sergeant with either a hand-held or body-worn camera, but that he was facing away from the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>After the beating, the prisoners said, Mr. Nantwi was dragged down the hall and down a flight of stairs, shackled and handcuffed, his face bloodied and swollen. One prisoner, Mr. Richards, said Mr. Nantwi “was not recognizable.”</p><p>Another prisoner, Michael Hummel-Parker, 32, recalled hearing Mr. Nantwi making gurgling noises — a sign, he said, that he could not breathe.</p><p>Once Mr. Nantwi became unresponsive, the officers took him to an infirmary in the prison, and on the way they assaulted him in a stairwell, the indictment said. He was dumped in a cell in the infirmary, where Officer Blair continued to beat him. Sgt. Donald Slawson, who mopped up the blood in the cell, was charged with tampering with physical evidence.</p><p>One inmate, Jerod Crosby, 46, said in an interview he watched from his cell window as Mr. Nantwi was given CPR inside an ambulance.</p><p>Almost immediately after Mr. Nantwi was taken to a nearby hospital, Sergeants Chandler and Ferrone ordered those involved in the assault to meet, according to the indictment. The sergeants and Officer Levi pleaded with the other officers to omit them from the department’s use-of-force reports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Sgt. Michael Iffert reported in official records that he had not witnessed force being used, even though he was standing directly outside Mr. Nantwi’s room. Sergeant Iffert was charged with offering a false instrument for filing.</p><p>Sergeant Chandler ordered another officer to retrieve a weapon that had been confiscated earlier in the day during an episode unrelated to Mr. Nantwi, the indictment said, and asked loudly which officer would “volunteer” to falsely claim that he had discovered it on the floor of his cell. Officer Eck agreed to do so, according to the indictment.</p><p>Sergeant Ferrone was caught discussing the weapon on a body-worn camera placed in the infirmary’s restroom, and uttered an expletive after spotting it, the indictment said.</p><p>The next day, at the direction of Sergeant Chandler, the guards met for breakfast at Raspberries, a local diner, to develop a story that “nothing improper” had been done to Mr. Nantwi, the indictment said.</p><p>The story they agreed to tell, according to the indictment, was that Mr. Nantwi had been armed with a weapon and that it had been recovered from his room.</p><p>Kenneth Sturtz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jan Ransom is an investigative reporter for The Times focusing on the criminal justice system, law enforcement and incarceration in New York.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
