The focus comes as Democrats work to recast themselves as the party of working people and accuse Republicans, historically known as the party of business, of stifling American entrepreneurship.</p><p>“President Trump’s trade war is economic arson on Main Street, and these folks are getting scorched,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said at a news conference this week with several small business owners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The outcry that we hear from our small businesses echoes what we heard during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, the top Democrat on the Small Business Committee, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/EHUGde5q-vk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a shadow hearing</a> held on Thursday by House Democrats. “Except this time, the government is causing the pain, not working to alleviate it.”</p><p>Democratic leaders have encouraged their rank-and-file members to focus on small businesses. Many of them did so last month when they fanned out across the country during a two-week recess.</p><p>Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada toured a <a href="https://x.com/SenJackyRosen/status/1913313990739910673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bicycle travel bag company</a> in Reno whose owner said that while he was thankful the Trump administration had paused its double-digit “reciprocal” tariffs on countries like Vietnam, his source for fabric, the continuing uncertainty would prevent his company from hiring more local staff as their business grows.</p><p>Both Senator Amy Klobuchar of <a href="https://x.com/SenAmyKlobuchar/status/1909320417594011840" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Minnesota</a> and Representative Pete Aguilar of <a href="https://x.com/RepPeteAguilar/status/1908323006528606695" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California</a> spoke with <a href="https://x.com/SenAmyKlobuchar/status/1909320417594011840" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">craft brewery owners</a> in their states about how the 25 percent levies on aluminum could force them to raise prices.</p><p>And Representative Nancy Pelosi of California gathered small business owners in a <a href="https://x.com/TeamPelosi/status/1915215674340749673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">San Francisco produce warehouse</a> to rail against the “fear and uncertainty” that the president’s tariffs had instilled in them, their employees and their customers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Republicans argue that small business owners are thriving under Mr. Trump. Kelly Loeffler, head of the Small Business Administration, has declared American manufacturers are spearheading an “industrial comeback,” pointing to a 74 percent increase in <a href="https://www.sba.gov/article/2025/04/17/sba-manufacturing-loans-skyrocket-under-trump-administration" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approvals for loans</a> to help small manufacturers expand. She has also said that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/loeffler-flips-script-medias-trump-tariffs-narrative-revealing-small-businesses-are-saying" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the small businesses she talks to</a> are “grateful” to Mr. Trump “for having the strength and the backbone to stand up to adversaries and allies alike.”</p><p>Asked in a recent interview whether he would consider tariff exemptions for small businesses, Mr. Trump scoffed.</p><p>“They’re not going to need it. They’re going to make so much money,” Mr. Trump said in the interview with Kristen Welker on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last Sunday.</p><p>Earlier in the interview, he had criticized Ms. Welker for focusing on small businesses.</p><p>“What about the car business?&#34; he asked. “They’re going to make a fortune because of the tariffs.”</p><p>For Amy Leinbach, a Texas business owner who spoke at Mr. Schumer’s news conference, news of the tariffs soured what otherwise would have been a breakthrough year for her shop, “Big Bee, Little Bee.” Ms. Leinbach designs and sells a line of eco-friendly silicone food storage containers and children’s products.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While she doesn’t consider herself a politically active person, Ms. Leinbach said she felt compelled to speak out against the tariffs soon after they were announced, and later connected with the Main Street Alliance, a progressive small business advocacy group that helped organize the news conference to further amplify her story. </p><p>“I’m not even going for my numbers now. We had sales goals, but literally, that’s out the window now,” Ms. Leinbach said. “Our goal is purely survival in the market until something changes.”</p><p>Those stories have not appeared to move the needle in the Republican-led Congress, where the House has proactively ceded its power to end Mr. Trump’s tariffs and Senate efforts to do so have either failed or stalled.</p><p>Senator John Curtis, Republican of Utah, acknowledged that tariffs were “disproportionately hard on small businesses” and said he had relayed numerous owners’ stories to the White House. But he said he would not be supporting legislation introduced this past week by Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would exempt small businesses from the tariffs.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which traditionally <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/us-chamber-of-commerce/summary?id=D000019798" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supports Republican candidates</a> and aligns with conservative policies, has <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/american-workers-businesses-consumers-trade-tariffs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highlighted the fears of small business owners</a> and even called on the administration to <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/u-s-chamber-to-administration-small-businesses-need-immediate-relief-from-tariffs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grant tariff exemptions</a> for local businesses and those who can’t feasibly source their products domestically, such as coffee roasters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the National Federation of Independent Business, one of the primary lobbying groups for small business interests, has not taken a position on the tariffs, given the lack of consensus among its members. Drawing broad conclusions about how small businesses across the board are responding to tariffs is “tricky,” said Jeff Brabant, the group’s head of federal government relations.</p><p>“When you represent manufacturing, retail, agriculture, services, everything under the sun, it affects everyone a little differently,” Mr. Brabant said. “I just don’t think it’s a crystal clear answer.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya C.
