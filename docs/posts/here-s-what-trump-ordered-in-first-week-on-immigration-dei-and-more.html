name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump’s blunt message after a whirlwind week of executive orders and presidential proclamations may boil down to this: Take me at my word.</p><p>During four years in political exile after his first term, Mr. Trump vowed to radically reshape American life, culture and politics if he got another chance. His first week has demonstrated that he will seek to do just that — and fast — as he races to make good on the promises that vaulted him back into power.</p><p>Not all of his directives will succeed in the end. But already, the United States is a different place than it was a week ago.</p><p>Several efforts to address climate change have been rescinded, and more land opened to oil drilling. The government now recognizes only two “immutable” genders, male and female. Migrants — now referred to as “aliens” — are being turned away at the border, and immigration agents have been freed to target hospitals, schools and churches in search of people to deport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Large-scale tariffs have yet to be imposed, but nations around the world are bracing for those that Mr. Trump says will come on Feb. 1. Diversity efforts in the federal government have been dismantled, and employees turned into snitches. Federal money will once again be barred from paying for abortions overseas. Mount Denali once again will be known as Mount McKinley, and the Gulf of Mexico is now the Gulf of America (at least, according to the U.S. government).</p><p>Career officials at agencies across the government have been let go as part of Mr. Trump’s pledge to get rid of what he considers disloyal members of the “deep state.” Security clearances and protection has been stripped from people Mr. Trump considers political enemies. TikTok was given a temporary reprieve from a forced shutdown, even as Mr. Trump rescinded his predecessor’s efforts to establish guardrails around the development of artificial intelligence.</p><p>New regulations and new federal hiring are frozen for now. More than 1,500 people who were convicted of crimes connected to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, have been pardoned or had their sentences commuted, including those who assaulted police officers.</p><p>Here are some of the biggest policy changes Mr. Trump has made.</p><h2 id="link-2f84a1ff">Immigration</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Customs and Border Protection agents checking the documents of migrants who had appointments to cross the border on Monday from Mexico into El Paso.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>No single issue received more attention in the first few days from Mr. Trump and his new administration than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/17/us/immigrants-trump-deportations.html" title="">immigration</a>. The issue has long been at the center of the president’s political identity, and he promised throughout the 2024 campaign to make far-reaching policy changes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump issued more than a dozen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-border-asylum-immigration.html" title="">immigration-related orders</a> that included scores of policy overhauls based on the premise that the United States is being invaded by dangerous immigrants crossing over the border with Mexico. Many of the most aggressive changes — including new powers to deny asylum seekers from entering the country — are aimed at “aliens engaged in the invasion.”</p><p>Mr. Trump quickly eliminated policies that prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from raiding churches, schools and hospitals.</p><p>He blocked the entry of thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-administration-refugee-flights-canceled.html" title="">refugees who already had been cleared to come to America</a>. He began the process of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-immigrants-deportation.html" title="">expelling a million people</a> President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had allowed in on a temporary but legal basis and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-pause.html" title="">halted several programs</a> allowing temporary residency, including for people from Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela. And he made good on his longstanding promise to try to scale back birthright citizenship, an order that one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/judge-blocks-birthright-citizenship.html" title="">federal judge quickly blocked</a>, calling it blatantly unconstitutional.</p><p>The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#trump-officials-seek-to-deputize-local-and-state-officers-in-immigration-enforcement" title="">sought to enlist state and local officials in federal immigration law enforcement</a> and directed federal officials to investigate and potentially prosecute officials in cities and states who interfere with the government’s deportation efforts. And the administration directed agencies to withhold funds from so-called sanctuary cities in which officials refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents.</p><p><em>— Hamed Aleaziz</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-a72435d">Climate and Energy</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump initiated a plan to open up large areas of Alaska, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to oil drilling.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Miller for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Trump issued a half-dozen executive orders related to energy aimed at expanding the use of fossil fuels, curbing renewable energy and abandoning the federal government’s efforts to address climate change.</p><p>He <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pulled</a> the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/trump-climate-policies.html" title="">shut down</a> several efforts to prepare for the risks of a warming planet. He <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-alaskas-extraordinary-resource-potential/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initiated plans</a> to open larger areas in Alaska to oil drilling. And he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/climate/wind-power-executive-order-trump.html" title="">ordered a freeze</a> on federal permits for wind farms across the country.</p><p>Many of Mr. Trump’s promises to “unleash” American energy — which he defined as everything <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/climate/trump-energy-fossil-fuels.html" title="">except wind and solar power</a> — will take time to have an impact. He ordered agencies to streamline permitting for gas pipelines and mining and to repeal rules that promote electric cars. But there’s a legally required process for redoing federal regulations that can take years and has to pass muster with courts.</p><p>Other actions may end up being largely symbolic. Mr. Trump declared an “energy emergency” and has claimed he has authority to get power plants built quickly, but legal experts say the government’s emergency powers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-emergency-oil-gas.html" title="">are often fairly limited</a>.</p><p>It remains to be seen how drastically Mr. Trump can reshape the nation’s energy landscape. Many oil and gas companies are not looking to significantly increase output, which is already at record levels, since doing so could lower prices and squeeze profits. But the wind industry, a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s, is bracing for a backlash, and some companies have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/siemens-energy-rwe-warn-trump-fallout-us-offshore-wind-sector-2024-11-13/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already</a> <a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/totalenergies-pauses-us-offshore-wind-array-after-trump-win/2-1-1744800" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delayed</a> or <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/01/22/prysmian-somerset-offshore-wind-cable-factory-canceled" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">canceled</a> new investments.</p><p><em>— Brad Plumer</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><h2 id="link-124b2b8">Tariffs and Trade</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shipping containers at a port in Qingdao, China.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump had previously written on social media that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on products from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10 percent tariff on products from China on Day 1 of his administration, accusing those countries of not doing enough to stop flows of drugs and migrants into the United States. Instead, he released an executive order that requested reports on an exhaustive list of trade issues from various agencies by April 1.</p><p>Some business groups expressed relief, but that sentiment was short-lived. On Monday night, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-tariffs-executive-order.html" title="">told reporters</a> he planned to put a 25 percent tariff on products from Canada and Mexico beginning on Feb. 1, and on Tuesday night, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/business/trump-tariffs-china.html" title="">said</a> he would also put an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese products by the same date.</p><p>It remains to be seen if those tariffs actually go into effect. But even if they do not, Mr. Trump will have plenty of opportunities in the coming months to make good on his campaign promises to impose sweeping tariffs on foreign products, including high levies on China and a universal tariff on most imports that could help raise money to offset tax cuts.</p><p><em>— Ana Swanson</em></p><h2 id="link-5092fc51">Gender and Transgender Rights</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of transgender rights demonstrating in front of the Supreme Court last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>With an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> billed as protecting women from “gender ideology extremism,” Mr. Trump ordered the government to effectively recognize only two “immutable” sexes — male and female.</p><p>By proclaiming that a person’s sex must be a permanent gender identity, the administration reversed efforts by the Biden administration to accommodate people who are intersex or transgender, among others, and allow them to self-identify as such in interactions with the government. It also rejected the mainstream medical understanding among groups such as the American Medical Association, which <a href="https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/policyfinder/detail/gender%20identity?uri=%2FAMADoc%2Fdirectives.xml-D-295.312.xml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommends</a> viewing gender and sex as falling along a spectrum.</p><p>The order has already prompted administrative changes. The State Department removed the “unspecified or another gender identity” category from passport applications. More broadly, it directs agencies to scrub any mention of nonbinary gender identity from official documents and memos.</p><p>Certain agencies were urged to “protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes,” in part by maintaining <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/trump-transgender-inmates-prison.html" title="">single-sex spaces such as prisons</a> and shelters for women, from which transgender women will be denied access under the policy. And the order explicitly rejected the Biden administration’s interpretation of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/bostock-decision-supreme-court.html" title="">Supreme Court ruling</a> protecting transgender workers that was the basis for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/biden-title-ix-rules.html" title="">extending protections to transgender students</a> through Title IX last year.</p><p><em>— Zach Montague</em></p><h2 id="link-1279121f">Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</h2><p>After declaring in his inaugural address that he would usher in a “colorblind” and “merit-based” society, Mr. Trump ordered federal agencies to immediately purge the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion — or D.E.I. — from the federal government’s policies, programs and practices and targeted civil rights protections for government contractors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He rescinded <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive orders issued by Mr. Biden that sought</a> to advance equity for women and Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American people, as well as people with disabilities.</p><p>Mr. Trump then issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an order</a> titled, “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” which halts all work in the federal agencies aimed at reversing systemic racism, sexism and other inequities.</p><p>The order required <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-dei-diversity-officials-orders.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">the shutdown of offices</a> dedicated to D.E.I. work across all government agencies and the immediate dismissal of any employees working on such initiatives; the employees were placed on administrative leave this week and are to be laid off in the next month.</p><p>In an effort to root out any D.E.I. initiatives “in disguise,” federal employees were told to report any colleagues that attempted to circumvent the order to a newly created email address. Those who know of any such activity but do not report it within 10 days would face “adverse consequences,” according to emails that were sent by all agency heads.</p><p>Mr. Trump also revoked a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/executive-order-11246/as-amended" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">civil rights-era order</a> signed by President Lyndon B.

The Supreme Court upheld the law this month.</p><p>The ban took effect on Sunday. But Mr. Trump on Monday told the Justice Department not to enforce the law for 75 days and to instruct companies, like Apple, Google and the cloud computing provider Oracle, that during that period there is “no liability” related to their work to distribute and maintain the app. The app is currently working in the United States but is still unavailable in Apple’s and Google’s app stores.</p><p><em>— David McCabe</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p><h2 id="link-1161adbb">Health and Foreign Aid</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Health professionals at a rural clinic treating Mpox in Kamituga, Democratic Republic of Congo.

Meetings of advisory panels on health issues were also canceled. Trump administration officials defended the move, saying it allowed them to catch up to activity in the department before signing off on new public messaging.
