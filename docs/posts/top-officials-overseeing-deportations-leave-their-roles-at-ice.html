The agency had arrested more than 66,000 people in the first 100 days of the Trump administration, an average of about 660 arrests a day. </p><p>“We are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day, and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every single day,” Mr. Miller said.</p><p>Homeland security officials said the moves on Thursday were meant to help make Mr. Trump’s immigration promises a reality.</p><p>“Organizational realignments will help ICE achieve President Trump and the American people’s mandate of arresting and deporting criminal illegal aliens and making American communities safe,” the department’s announcement said.</p><p>In February, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/trump-ice-leadership.html" title="">ICE moved two top officials</a> overseeing deportation efforts.
