Since the gift was first announced Lauder, the emeritus chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">whose fortune was estimated by Forbes this year at $15.1 billion</a> — has quietly added 12 major Cubist works to the Met’s holdings — by artists including Picasso, Léger, Gris and Braque. Beyond these 20th century masters he is also helping the museum shore up its representation of postwar and contemporary artists, with seminal paintings by Alex Katz, Roy Lichtenstein and Larry Rivers.</p><p>On a wintry day, he pointed to a painting by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/16/arts/larry-rivers-artist-with-an-edge-dies-at-78.html" title="">Rivers</a>, the proto-pop artist, on an adjacent wall. (He died in 2002.) “Rivers was not appreciated in his time,” said Lauder, who first fell in love with his work at a show at the Jewish Museum in 1965. “I just bought another Rivers — ‘The Last Civil War Veteran’ (1960) — for the Met because I realized they didn’t have a major work by him.’’</p><p>The Met’s photography collection has also benefited from Lauder’s largess, with a growing number of Irving Penn images he is constantly buying, mostly from dealers. Perhaps less known among his holdings is a group of graphically bold and colorful literary posters created in the 19th century by top illustrators to publicize magazines, newspapers and books. In 1984 Lauder donated them to the Met — it was the first entire collection he gave the museum — and since then the number of posters has more than doubled, to some 400 works.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“What museums are known for is not their architecture or their shows but ultimately their collections,’’ Lauder said. But building great collections takes time, patience and determination. Together with Emily Braun, an art history professor at Hunter College who has been Lauder’s curator for 37 years, they know where all the great Cubist works are, keep a keen eye on auctions and art galleries and think nothing of spending years trying to get a coveted painting or drawing. “It keeps me alive,” he said. “I don’t want to stop.”</p><p>Sometimes they succeed in their hunt; sometimes they don’t. Collecting, Lauder explains “requires study, travel, perseverance, mistakes, refinement and, of course, buying.’’</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A visitor studies Fernand Léger’s “Composition (The Typographer),” 1918-19, oil on canvas, at the 2014 exhibition “Cubism: The Leonard A.

In 1969 Hester sold it to <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/research-centers/leonard-a-lauder-research-center/research-resources/modern-art-index-project/koerfer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jacques Koerfer,”</a> the German-born former chairman of BMW and collector of modern art.</p><p>“I thought that the moment had passed forever,” Lauder mused. “Of course, I heard my mother’s voice in my head, ‘You only regret what you do not buy,’ but it was too late.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Eight years after Koerfer died in 1990, Christie’s auctioned several paintings from his estate. Because of the large size of the Léger (it measures more than 8 feet by 6 feet), Lauder said, “my sense was that I’d be able to purchase it because collectors of early Modernism are drawn to more modestly scaled works.” He was successful. “However, it was so large,” he recalls,<span>  </span>“we had to remove the windows in our living room and have the crate hoisted by crane from the street.

Lauder became a trustee in 1977, and eventually, its most important benefactor. In 2008, rather than contributing toward the construction of its new home in Manhattan’s meat packing district, he gave the Whitney $131 million toward its endowment, the biggest donation in the institution’s history.</p><p>In 1977, he recalled, he persuaded 15 people to donate $5,000 each to buy “Die Fahne Hoch!’’ (“Hold the Flag High’’), an early Black Painting by the young Frank Stella. The owners, Eugene and Barbara Schwartz, prominent collectors, had agreed to give it to the Whitney as a joint gift, if the museum could raise the other half, $75,000. In his 2020 memoir “The Company I Keep: My Life in Beauty,’’ Lauder explained that when he finally was able to get the 15 donors together to buy it, the wall label read “like the Manhattan phone book — a very long list of names.

His most recent purchase for the Whitney is a larger-than-life steel sculpture depicting a seated man with a haggard, forlorn stare, by the artist Charles Ray.

Also, I could get them for free.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>That was the beginning of a lifetime of collecting postcards. “I’m interested in popular culture and that’s where postcards come in,’’ he explained. “I love that they’re the predecessor for so many things: email, Instagram, social media.’’</p><p>In 2002, realizing that the Museum of Fine Arts Boston had the largest and most important collection of Japanese woodblock prints outside of Japan, Lauder gave the institution a collection of some 20,000 Japanese postcards.</p><p>“The postcard was in many ways the successor to the woodblock print,’’ explained Benjamin Weiss, the senior curator of visual culture at the M.F.A. “Around 1900, as traditional woodblock prints became unfashionable in Japan, much of the artistic invention that had kept prints at the center of attention over the previous century and a half — and which had captured the imagination of viewers and collectors in Europe and the United States — migrated to the postcard. ”</p><p>Eight years later, in 2010, Lauder ended up giving Boston more than 100,000 postcards from the 1870s through just after World War II. “The collection is still growing,’’ Weiss said, especially what is known as <a href="https://www.mfa.org/press-release/real-photo-postcards" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Photo Postcards,</a> which are cards printed from photographic negatives and capture daily life in early- 20th-century America.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Real Photo Postcards: Pictures From a Changing Nation&#34; from the Leonard Lauder collection to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Postcards and photographs share a similar visual aesthetic. Little wonder then that Lauder came to his love of photography. In the 1970s he had already commissioned Irving Penn to photograph ads for Clinique that highlighted either a single product or several meticulously arranged on a shelf. “It’s so important to present products in an engaging way to the people we are trying to reach,’’ he said. The images instantly helped define the Lauder brand.

Lauder Research Center for Modern Art, where<span>  </span>scholars<span>  </span>organize small shows that focus on the work of a particular artist. Its inaugural exhibition — “Birds of a Feather,’’ in 2018 — explored the artist Joseph Cornell’s fascination with Juan Gris’s collage, “The Man at the Café,’’ depicting a mysterious male figure reading a French newspaper, with a black fedora casting an eerie shadow.</p><p>In 2021 Lauder ended up giving the collage to the Met. It is the largest example of Gris’s papiers collés, or pasted papers from 1913 and 1914, that are not only rare (he produced 40 over an eight-month period) but considered the highest point of his creativity.
