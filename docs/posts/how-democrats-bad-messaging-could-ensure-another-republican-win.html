    <h1>How Democrats’ Bad Messaging Could Ensure Another Republican Win</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Democrats are out of power across the federal government. They’re confronting an antagonistic Supreme Court, a Congress that is almost totally abdicating its power, the wealthiest man in the world wielding a chain saw, and a president with nothing to lose.</p><p>As dark as this moment might seem, Democrats have an opportunity to capitalize on the chaos created by Donald Trump, whose policies — from tariffs to government layoffs — will be a disaster for Americans, including his own supporters.</p><p>The Opinion video above demonstrates how Democrats are doing that. Or not doing that.</p></div></div>
