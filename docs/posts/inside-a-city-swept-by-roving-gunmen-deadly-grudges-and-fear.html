But we spoke by phone with more than 40 residents and interviewed local leaders, Syrian officials, war monitoring groups, analysts and human rights experts.</p><p>We also obtained and verified dozens of videos and photographs taken during the killings and their immediate aftermath, despite a government ban on documenting evidence of the violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>We found that armed civilians and former rebel groups carried out many of the killings in Baniyas. At least some government soldiers deployed to restore order also participated in the killings, according to a Syrian government official and residents.<br/></p><p>Our reporting showed how little control the new government and its leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html" title="">the former jihadist and rebel commander Ahmed al-Shara</a>, now exercise over the various armed groups and former rebels that have nominally joined his government.</p><p>They include Sunni Muslim extremists and foreign jihadists who consider Alawites to be heretics. Many of them, along with those in Mr. al-Shara’s own rebel group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-hts-who-what.html" title="">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a>, also want vengeance for brutality committed by the Alawite-dominated Assad regime.</p><p>The exact identities of all of the armed groups involved in the killings remain unclear.</p><p>Syria’s authorities have denied that their security forces committed atrocities but said that they were investigating and holding to account anyone who had harmed civilians. In March, the government formed two committees, one to investigate those involved in violence against civilians and another to protect Alawite communities on the coast from further violence.</p><p>Security forces have arrested at least two<strong> </strong>people in connection with the violence, officials said, though the investigation remains ongoing. No evidence has surfaced to suggest that senior leaders in the new government directed the killings, according to war monitors and diplomats. Government officials did not respond to a request for comment for this article.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Baniyas, the government’s assurances have meant little to residents who saw the chaos.</p><p>Over the past month, around 20,000 Syrians have fled to Lebanon, according to Lebanese officials and rights groups.

Baniyas, home to around 40,000 people, sits at its center.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The city is divided along sectarian lines: The south is home mostly to Sunni Muslims, while the northern neighborhoods are mostly Alawite. Though some Alawites in Baniyas served in Mr. al-Assad’s military, many others were disenfranchised under his government, according to residents.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fighters with the new Syrian government lining a road in Baniyas on March 7.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>When Mr. al-Assad was ousted in December, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/middleeast/syria-clashes-assad.html" title="">many feared</a> the coast was a powder keg. Elite forces from Mr. al-Assad’s military had retreated to the area, former regime officers told us. Some called for Alawites to mobilize an armed response against Syria’s new authorities.</p><p>Then, on Thursday, March 6, those fears were realized.</p><p>That afternoon, former security forces in the Assad regime <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/middleeast/syria-clashes-assad.html" title="">launched a series of ambushes</a> on government troops across the coast. The Syrian authorities responded in force, and gunfire and artillery consumed Latakia Province for hours.</p><p>The clashes reached Baniyas around 2 a.m. Friday. Assad loyalists laid siege to the main police station, residents and officials said. As wounded police officers flooded into Baniyas’s state-run hospital, snipers began picking off government personnel guarding its doors.</p><p>By dawn, the coast was imploding.</p><h2 id="link-3748d82d">The Gunmen</h2><p>On Friday morning, Siba, 30, a kindergarten teacher, was sitting in her living room in al-Qusour, a predominately Alawite neighborhood in Baniyas. She scrolled through the state media’s Telegram channel, where the government announced it was sending reinforcements to search for the armed groups that had attacked its troops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Siba said she and her brother, Ahmad, 36, were relieved. They had barely slept the night before as gunfire rang out, and she hoped government troops would be able to restore calm.</p><p>“We thought it’s OK, we’ll stay inside and all the blasts and gunfire would be over soon,” she told us.</p><p>A few hours later, around a dozen men who said they were from the government’s elite General Security forces — units made up of the rebels who overthrew Mr. al-Assad — arrived at Siba’s door, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph released by Syria state media shows members of the Syrian security forces entering Baniyas on March 7.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Her brother and their 70-year-old father walked outside, their hands raised.</p><p>Ahmad explained that he had worked as a military officer under the Assad government and handed them a document, issued by Syria’s new authorities, proving he had surrendered his weapons. Her father told the soldiers he was retired and had worked for the city’s state-owned power plant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Siba said the security forces inspected the document, searched the house for weapons and, finding none, told the family to remain inside.</p><p>“They said it was safer to stay in our home, that they were only going after the remnants of the regime that attacked them,” Siba told us. The forces, she said, “were very respectful with us.”</p><p>Like many other residents, Siba did not realize that other armed groups were also coming with a different motive: hunting down Alawites.</p><p>Many residents told us that, at first, they assumed those gunmen were members of the government’s elite security forces. Most wore military fatigues and drove trucks outfitted with machine guns, similar to those in photographs on the state media’s Telegram channel, according to photographs and videos we verified.</p><p>But as the groups tore through the streets, residents said, they realized these were not government reinforcements sent to restore order. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Some of the gunmen shouted in formal or broken Arabic and were dressed in salwar kameez, the long-sleeved tunic and long pants worn in South and Central Asia — a clue to locals that they were probably foreign jihadists. Others appeared to be armed civilians seeking revenge for wrongs committed during the civil war, residents said.</p><p>By late Friday morning, those groups far outnumbered government forces in the region, according to two Syrian officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalists. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of Syria’s government security forces at an intersection in Baniyas on March 9.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Around 20 minutes after the government forces left Siba’s house, one of the soldiers returned with a different group of armed men, she said. They shouted for Siba’s father and brother by name and dragged them outside. Siba followed them to their back garden.</p><p>The gunmen shot her brother five times, according to Siba and her husband, Muhanad, 40, who was not home when the gunmen arrived but later recovered Ahmad’s body.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>When her father cried out, “No! No!” the gunmen shot him too, Siba said.</p><p>“I was screaming and crying,” she said. “I lost my mind at that moment.”</p><p>Before they left, Siba said one of them paused and stared her down. “What, are you scared now?” he growled. “We’ll come back for you.”</p><p>Siba raced back inside and dropped to the ground, her entire body trembling.</p><p>When the gunshots subsided, she ran to a forest line’s thicket nearby. She stayed there for two days, unable to shake the image of her father and brother lying bloodied in their yard.</p><p>“My father was our love, he was our pillar,” she said. “The men were like Satan, they just killed him.”</p><h2 id="link-32b752b2">The Killing Spree</h2><p>Over the next three days, the armed groups rained terror across Baniyas.</p><p>The gunmen went door to door, killing Alawites in their homes, residents told us. At one apartment building, a group of men shoved a resident onto his knees, called him an “Alawite dog” and demanded he bark before shooting him, according to two of his neighbors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>Other gunmen drove over the bodies of those killed in the street, videos verified by The Times show.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this photograph provided by the Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets, members of the group are collecting the bodies of people found dead in Baniyas on March 9.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>The overtly sectarian killings sowed panic across Baniyas, where many had started to trust Syria’s new authorities. In their first three months in power, the government’s security forces in Tartus Province had largely made good on their promises to maintain stability.</p><p>Jihan, 30, who worked in a farm supply store, had found those forces professional and respectful. She said that she and her family did not support the Assad government, and that when his regime collapsed, she was relieved.</p><p>Then on Saturday morning, Jihan saw a convoy of gunmen set her neighbor’s house aflame on the outskirts of al-Qusour neighborhood. She rushed upstairs and hid in a bedroom with her brother, Qusay, and other relatives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>A few minutes later, men forced open their front door. The family heard plates and glasses shatter — and then boots stomping up the stairs.</p><p>Two masked men in military fatigues burst in and pointed their rifles at Qusay, Jihan told us. He held up his ID card, showing he was a civilian. The gunmen tossed it aside.</p><p>They dragged him downstairs and forced him onto his knees, Jihan and two of her relatives said. As they rifled through the family’s belongings, Qusay recognized one of the men. He<strong> </strong>had been a customer at his grocery store, and a member of the new government’s forces, according to Jihan and a store employee sheltering with them.</p><p>“You know me, please,” Qusay begged. The man told Qusay that he could not help.</p><p>Upstairs, an older man with the militia demanded that Jihan hand over all of her cash, gold and phones, or her nieces would be killed. Then the gunmen threw Qusay in their car and sped away,<strong> </strong>according to Jihan, the employee and another person present.</p><p>Moments after the gunmen left, she and her relatives dashed out their back door and ran for the mountains outside the city. When Jihan called her brother’s phone a few hours later, a man with a gruff voice picked up. Jihan asked if her brother was still alive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>The man laughed, Jihan recalled. “We killed your brother on the street,” he said.</p><p>Days later, Jihan’s father combed through the bodies on the roads, one by one. After hours of searching, he found Qusay, his chest riddled with bullet wounds and blood staining the pavement.</p><h2 id="link-3ad3e442">The Escape</h2><p>As terror swept through the city, thousands of desperate Alawites fled. Some hid in the forests on the city’s outskirts, surviving for days on leaves and river water, according to residents. Others left in their cars, dodging bodies that lay in the streets.</p><p>As the massacre dragged on, escaping the city grew difficult. Gunmen had fanned out and set up checkpoints to prevent Alawites from leaving.
