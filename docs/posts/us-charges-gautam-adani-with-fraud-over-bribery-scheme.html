Mr. Adani and his associates “lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil case saying that Adani Green Energy raised more than $175 million from U.S. investors as part of its fund-raising. One of Mr. Adani’s associates was charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials.</p><p>Other executives at Mr. Adani’s energy company were also charged Wednesday, including Sagar R. Adani, Mr. Adani’s nephew; Vneet S. Jaain; as well as former employees of a Canadian institutional investor who are accused of conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Adani could not be immediately reached for comment.</p><p>The criminal charges against Mr. Adani come nearly two years after <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Adani’s</a> conglomerate, the Adani Group, was accused of “brazen accounting fraud, stock manipulation and money laundering,” by Hindenburg Research, a small investment firm in New York.</p><p>The Adani Group denied those claims, but its stock price cratered after the report.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
