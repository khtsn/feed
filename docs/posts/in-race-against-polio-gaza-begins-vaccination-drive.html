Videos showed doctors and health workers squeezing droplets of the poliovirus vaccine into the mouths of children who were being treated at the hospital.</p><p>“I knew about this campaign by chance. I was frightened when I heard the word polio,” said Maysaa Abu Daqqa, a mother of a 9-year-old, Habib Nizam. Ms. Abu Daqaa was waiting in a patients’ room at Nasser hospital. “When I saw other women accepting the vaccinations for their children, I was encouraged to follow them,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Both Hamas and Israel have agreed to the pauses in the fighting to allow the vaccinations to take place, but the campaign will be tricky to execute. With much of Gaza’s infrastructure destroyed, and some 90 percent of the enclave’s roughly two million residents having repeatedly fled Israeli bombardment, it may be impossible to ensure the immunization of all of the enclave’s estimated 640,000 children under age 10.</p><p>“This is a race against time,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head the U.N. agency in charge of Palestinians, said in <a href="https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1830143292572340498" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a>. </p><p>For families seeking to get their children vaccinated, the challenges are layered and fraught: Not only must they trust that the cessations in fighting will hold, but many will have to find transportation, navigate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-debris-un.html" title="">blocked and broken roads</a> and expose themselves to danger and widespread <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/world/europe/gaza-crime-thieves-markets.html" title="">lawlessness</a> to reach the vaccination sites.</p><p>The 2,100 people trained to conduct the vaccination drive will face risks, too, including anxieties over a history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/gaza-doctors-medical-workers-israel.html" title="">deadly assaults</a> on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-workers-un.html" title="">aid workers</a> since the war began.</p><p>At a news briefing at Nasser Hospital on Saturday, Dr. Bassam Abu Hamad, a member of the polio campaign committee in Gaza, tried to encourage families to get their children vaccinated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Acknowledging potential concerns some parents might have, he said that the vaccine “is safe and rarely has any side effects,” and urged mothers to “convince each other” to vaccinate their children. “The amazing thing here is the perseverance and determination by the locals to get the vaccines, despite the horrific and harsh situation we are all going through,” Dr. Abu Hamad said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sewage pooling in a street in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, in July.

Largely eradicated around the world by decades of public health campaigns, it can thrive in unsanitary conditions and in places where vaccination rates are not high enough. Such rates in Gaza, which health officials have said were at about 99 percent as recently as 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/middleeast/gaza-polio-crisis.html" title="">have dropped significantly among babies because of the war</a>.</p><p>The vaccine drive will be conducted through staggered pauses of fighting in different regions of the Gaza Strip designed to allow aid workers to try to vaccinate children at roughly 700 medical facilities, mobile clinics and shelters.</p><p>Israel will “allow a humanitarian corridor” for vaccination personnel to travel and will establish “designated safe areas” for them to administer vaccines during certain hours, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Israel views with importance the prevention of a polio outbreak in the Gaza Strip, including for the purpose of preventing the spread of diseases in the region,” it said.</p><p>The campaign is expected to last for three days, with each humanitarian pause in place from early morning until midafternoon. There will be an option to extend the vaccine drive if necessary, and then local health officials will shift their focus to southern Gaza. The northern region of the enclave will be treated last, according to the staggered schedule <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/29/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war?smid=url-share#hfo-israel-has-emphasized-the-move-is-not-the-first-step-to-a-cease-fire" title="">announced by global health officials on Thursday</a>.</p><p>Gazans received a text message from the health ministry on Saturday, announcing the beginning of the vaccination drive for children under 10 years old across different parts of the strip starting on Sept. 1.</p><p>The vaccination campaign kicked off in central Gaza, where the health ministry said clinics, hospitals and U.N. schools would be offering the vaccine during the hours of the humanitarian pause.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians gathered at a U.N. healthcare center in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ramadan Abed/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The W.H.O. and UNICEF, the U.N. children’s fund, have rushed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/polio-gaza-vaccines.html" title="">more than 1.2 million doses</a> of oral polio vaccines to the region, and say that another 400,000 doses are on their way.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Dr. Majdi Dheir, the head of the campaign against polio in Gaza, said more than 2,700 people had been trained by experts from the health ministry, the World Health Organization and UNICEF to carry out the vaccinations. </p><p>Once the first round of vaccinations is complete, a second, booster round of immunizations will need to be administered four weeks later. Israel has agreed to repeat the staggered humanitarian pauses for the boosters as well.</p><p>The scale, ambition and logistics of the vaccination campaign are unprecedented in the Gaza war. The fact that the plan for it came together in only six weeks of negotiations after the virus was first detected is a sign of just how serious public health officials believe an outbreak could be.</p><p>Because polio can strike and spread rapidly, it is not only a risk to Gazans, but also could spread to neighboring Egypt or Israel, and potentially beyond. Whether the disease can now be contained is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/polio-gaza-vaccines.html" title="">impossible</a> to determine, health experts have said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Israel has begun to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-to-give-booster-vaccinations-to-soldiers-after-polio-virus-found-in-gaza-sewage/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offer</a> booster vaccines for soldiers operating in Gaza.
