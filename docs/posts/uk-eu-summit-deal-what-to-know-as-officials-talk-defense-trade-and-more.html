They are also expected to announce a deal on extending access to fishing waters, to discuss trade and to commit to collaboration on other geopolitical issues.</p><p>Here’s what to watch as the two sides meet.</p><h2 id="link-80f6fb7">Where is the summit taking place and who is involved?</h2><p>Keir Starmer, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, is hosting Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, and Antonio Costa, the European Council president, as well as Kaja Kallas, the E.U.’s top diplomat, and Maros Sefcovic, the bloc’s top trade official. The event is expected to take place at Lancaster House in London on Monday morning, and will wrap up with a midday news conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Negotiations went down to the wire: Final details were still being discussed in the hours leading up to the event on Sunday and Monday. But by Monday morning, it was clear that a deal had been reached.</p><p>Details had begun to trickle in from European diplomats. Nick Thomas-Symonds, a senior British minister responsible for the negotiations, described it as a “historic day” in a social media <a href="https://x.com/NickTorfaen/status/1924368945277981023" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on</a> the agreement.</p><h2 id="link-7c1cbbfe">What will they announce?</h2><p>Officials are expected to announce a new defense agreement, which would be the biggest outcome of the summit. Policymakers on both sides have been negotiating for weeks on the plans, which are expected to set a future tone for relations at a critical moment, as Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on and as the United States urges European nations to ramp up their own military spending and shoulder a greater responsibility for their own security.</p><p>This could lay the groundwork for Britain to eventually become part of European defense efforts, including a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/world/europe/europe-trump-ukraine-defense.html" title="">150 billion euro</a> loan program meant to help with joint procurement and investment. That plan is limited to E.U. nations and select allies, and Britain has been eager to take part.</p><p>Trade and immigration are also be on the agenda. The point is “a strengthened partnership with the European Union,” Mr. Starmer’s office said in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-eu-summit" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">talking points published</a> over the weekend, saying that would be “good for our jobs, good for our bills and good for our borders.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2eee6617">What have been the sticking points?</h2><p>Reaching an agreement has not been seamless. Europeans — and particularly coastal countries like France and Belgium — insisted that London extend access to U.K. fishing waters for more than a few years. Fishing is a politically sensitive topic, and the British side was hesitant to make that move.</p><p>After discussions that went to the last minute, the two sides agreed that they would allow European boats to access British fishing waters until June 30, 2038, according to a European diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the decision. That’s not the indefinite extension that some in Europe wanted, but it is a far longer window than the British had initially suggested.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>French fishing boats protesting post-Brexit restrictions in front of the port of Saint Helier off the British Island of Jersey in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sameer Al-Doumy/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Likewise, tensions had emerged over a youth mobility program, which is meant to give young people and students from both sides access to each other’s countries. Europe was pushing for lower tuition for E.U. students who study at U.K. universities, asking for the same fees that local students pay. Their counterparts argued that granting that access would be too expensive.</p><p>The final deal is expected to be broad-brush — a plan to collaborate in the future, but one with details that remain to be determined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There’s a lot of negotiation to be done on the other side” of the summit, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the research firm Eurasia Group.</p><h2 id="link-1e435b59">What are the politics?</h2><p>The European Union has been working hard to clinch trade deals and shore up alliances as it tries to prove to the United States that it is an economic and diplomatic power to be reckoned with.</p><p>President Trump has hit Europe with several waves of tariffs — both across-the-board and industry-specific — and is only beginning to make deals to de-escalate the situation. While Britain has struck a preliminary deal to avert much-higher tariffs, the European Union has made limited progress toward one.</p><p>And both partners see a need for greater collaboration in a world where the United States is a less-willing supporter of its traditional allies. Britain’s firms and its defense industry could benefit from being included in Europe’s push to rearm, and Europe could benefit from access to British military capabilities.</p><p>But both sides face domestic pressure to defend their own interests.</p><p>The insurgent Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, a Trump ally and famous Brexit backer, has been taking particular aim at the proposed <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-needs-labor-shortage-not-eu-youth-mobility-nigel-farages-richard-tice/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">youth mobility plan</a>. Given Reform’s success in recent local elections, that pressure could give Mr. Starmer a reason to avoid too cozy of a tone — or risk political fallout.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeanna Smialek is the Brussels bureau chief for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
