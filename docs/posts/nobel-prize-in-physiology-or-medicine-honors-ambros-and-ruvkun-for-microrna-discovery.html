Delighted. Everything you might expect. Honestly, it was this was not something that I expected.” “There are a lot of awards, but the Nobel is in its own class in terms of how much attention it gets. So, I don’t know, I’ve probably gotten 10 different awards over the last 20 years. There’s never been a press conference like this or TV cameras or, you know, nothing like this. So it’s a completely different world.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/07/multimedia/07nobel-prize-gjql/07nobel-prize-gjql-square640-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of microRNA, which plays a role in organism development and gene regulation.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/teddy-rosenbluth"><img alt="Teddy Rosenbluth" title="Teddy Rosenbluth" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/21/reader-center/author-teddy-rosenbluth/author-teddy-rosenbluth-thumbLarge.png"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/derrick-bryson-taylor"><img alt="Derrick Bryson Taylor" title="Derrick Bryson Taylor" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/16/reader-center/author-derrick-bryson-taylor/author-derrick-bryson-taylor-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-10-07T14:37:31-04:00"><span>Oct. 7, 2024</span><span>Updated <span>2:37 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for the discovery of microRNA, a tiny class of RNA molecules that play a crucial role in determining how organisms mature and function — and how they sometimes malfunction.</p><p>Working with curious, millimeter-size roundworms of the species Caenorhabditis elegans, the two laureates’ discovery revealed a new principle of gene regulation that is crucial for the development and health of multicellular organisms, including humans, <a href="https://x.com/NobelPrize/status/1843223199431250289" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Prize officials said</a>.</p><p>Dr. Ambros is a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester, Mass., and Dr. Ruvkun is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p><p>Gene regulation determines differences between types of cells, and if it goes off track it can lead to diseases such as cancer, diabetes or autoimmunity, the Nobel committee said.

As they studied C. elegans, they at first felt a smidgen of friendly competition as they each started their own labs in the Boston area, Dr. Ambros said.</p><p>“I better see if I can see everything that Gary might see so I don’t look stupid,” he often thought.</p><p>Researchers, he said, often have an instinct to hold their findings close to their chest — the field has a “publish or perish” culture that incentivizes scientists to submit their discoveries in academic journals first.</p><p>But he said the moment that he and Dr. Ruvkun discovered their research had collided, the competition faded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He remembered the phone call when they realized that the microRNA discovered in Dr. Ambrose’s lab attached onto the larger RNA that Dr. Ruvkun’s lab worked on, as if they were two perfect puzzle pieces coming together.</p><p>“Do you see it?” he remembered shouting into the landline. “Do you see it?”</p><p>As its name suggests, microRNA is much shorter than its RNA counterpart. While typical RNA might have hundreds or thousands of basic building blocks, microRNA might have only dozens.</p><p>What the two Nobel laureates eventually showed was that microRNA act as “controllers” of the process that produces proteins, telling the larger RNA when to slow down or stop.</p><p>This is important because too much or too little of a given protein can result in diseases like cancer or osteoporosis. Mutations in the genes that have instructions for microRNA have been linked to congenital hearing loss, and eye and skeletal disorders, Nobel Prize officials said.</p><h2 id="link-62e21f3">A micro-discovery’s tiny impact</h2><p>The discovery was originally described in 1993 in two <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8252622/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">separate</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8252621/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">papers</a> published in the journal Cell. The first author on Dr. Ambros’s paper was Rosalind Lee, his wife, who <a href="https://x.com/NobelPrize/status/1843252351152390392" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">celebrated the Nobel committee’s call with him Monday morning</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But the papers at first were met with “almost deafening silence,” the Nobel committee wrote, because many scientists believed this process to be unique to roundworms, and not relevant to humans or other more complicated animals.</p><p>The duo didn’t realize how influential their discovery would be until years later, when Dr. Ruvkun found evidence that the same gene responsible for microRNA in his worms was present in the human genome.</p><p>He called scientists from around the world and begged them to ship RNA samples from clams, earthworms, zebrafish, whatever he could get his hands on.</p><p>One after another, his lab tested the mailed samples and found microRNA genes, an indication to him that this genetic regulation process appeared across the animal kingdom.</p><p>When Dr. Ambros read Dr. Ruvkun’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35040556" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper in Nature</a>, he came to a similar conclusion:</p><p>“That was the moment when I realized this is something way bigger than I ever expected,” he said.</p><p>As they worked together, the two were “always on the phone with each other,” Dr. Ruvkun said, comparing research and marveling at their results, even late at night while Dr. Ambros tended to a newborn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Dr. Ambros said he hoped that their award also highlights the importance of public funding of research. Throughout their careers, the two researchers received more than $62 million from the National Institutes of Health, according to an agency spokeswoman.</p><p>“It supported me all my career,” he said. “Taxpayers of the United States should feel proud.”</p><p>Luisa Cochella, a microRNA researcher and a proud “worm person” at Johns Hopkins University, said this discovery underscored the importance of doing basic research on simpler, maybe less glamorous, animals, even if there are no obvious applications to human biology.</p><p>“When you are really trying to deeply understand how something works, you get these unexpected findings,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-1f108361">Who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2023?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/health/nobel-prize-medicine.html" title="">Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman</a> recognized work that led to the development of potent Covid vaccines that were administered to billions around the world.</p><h2 id="link-37aa440f">When will the other Nobel Prizes be announced?</h2><p>The prize for physiology or medicine is the first of six Nobel Prizes that will be awarded this year.
