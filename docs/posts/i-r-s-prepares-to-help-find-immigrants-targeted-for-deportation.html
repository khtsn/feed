The I.R.S. has long encouraged undocumented immigrants to pay their taxes, giving people without Social Security numbers a separate nine-digit code called an individual taxpayer identification number to file their returns.</p><p>Tax information is closely guarded because federal law bars improper disclosure. I.R.S. officials had resisted earlier requests from the Department of Homeland Security to turn over information about unauthorized immigrants, warning that doing so could violate federal law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the Trump administration has since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-irs-lawyer-doge.html" title="">replaced the top I.R.S. lawyer</a>, and the agreement now under discussion appears to be narrower than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/irs-immigrants-addresses.html" title="">an earlier request</a>, which asked the I.R.S. to hand over, rather than confirm, migrants’ addresses.</p><p>Officials were still finalizing the agreement, the terms of which were earlier <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2025/03/22/ice-irs-immigrants-deport/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported by The Washington Post</a>. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which oversees the I.R.S., did not respond to a request for comment. ICE also did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly tried to enlist I.R.S. agents in its broad immigration crackdown, asking them to audit companies that might be hiring unauthorized immigrants.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eileen Sullivan is a Times reporter covering the changes to the federal work force under the Trump administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eileen-sullivan">More about Eileen Sullivan</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
