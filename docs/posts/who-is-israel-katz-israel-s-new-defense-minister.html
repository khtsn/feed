Both militant groups are backed by Iran, a country which attacked and was attacked by Israel during his time as the country’s top diplomat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After Israel barred the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, from the country last month for failing to strenuously condemn an Iranian missile attack, one of the largest such barrages in history, Mr. Katz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-guterres-un-ban-persona-non-grata.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">criticized</a> him. In a statement, Mr. Katz said of the secretary general “anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran’s heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil.”</p><p>Mr. Katz previously served as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/31/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news?searchResultPosition=4#israel-names-a-new-foreign-minister-part-of-a-prewar-political-agreement" title="">foreign minister</a> from 2019-2020 before being reappointed in early 2024 as part of a political agreement implemented before the country’s war against Hamas. He is a former member of the Israeli Parliament and has worked in other government positions such as minister of finance, transportation, energy and agriculture.</p><p>He has never held a top military position, unlike the popular Mr. Gallant, an experienced former general.</p><p>After former President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017, Mr. Katz, then serving as a minister of transportation and intelligence, petitioned to name a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/world/middleeast/israeli-yisrael-katz-trump-station.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">train station</a> after the American leader, “for his courageous and historic decision.” </p><p>Like the prime minister, Mr. Katz is a decades-long member of the Likud party and a supporter of the settlement movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Before firing Mr. Gallant on Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu had clashed with him both over the conduct of the war and domestic issues.</p><p>The two disagreed over proposals for the future administration of Gaza and the cease-fire talks. They also disagreed over legislation supporting the overhaul of the Israeli judiciary and about the conscription of ultra-Orthodox Israelis into the country’s armed forces.</p><p>“In recent months, the trust between me and the defense minister was damaged,” Mr. Netanyahu said on Tuesday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Netanyahu and Gallant’s Disagreements:</strong><strong> </strong>Yoav Gallant, the ousted cabinet minister, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gallant-israel.html">sharp public disagreements</a> over Israel’s war against Hamas and what will follow it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden Officials Struggle With Lebanon:</strong><strong> </strong>Despite hopes that political shifts in Beirut could bring lasting peace to the Israel-Lebanon border, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/biden-lebanon-israel-iran.html">the United States may have to settle for a quicker fix</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Elections:</strong><strong> </strong>Gazans fear <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/gaza-us-election-harris-trump.html">neither candidate in the U.S. election will help them</a>.
