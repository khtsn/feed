    <h1>Who Is Israel Katz, Israel’s New Defense Minister?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After Israel barred the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, from the country last month for failing to strenuously condemn an Iranian missile attack, one of the largest such barrages in history, Mr. Katz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-guterres-un-ban-persona-non-grata.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">criticized</a> him. In a statement, Mr. Katz said of the secretary general “anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran’s heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil.”</p><p>Mr. Katz previously served as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/31/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news?searchResultPosition=4#israel-names-a-new-foreign-minister-part-of-a-prewar-political-agreement" title="">foreign minister</a> from 2019-2020 before being reappointed in early 2024 as part of a political agreement implemented before the country’s war against Hamas. He is a former member of the Israeli Parliament and has worked in other government positions such as minister of finance, transportation, energy and agriculture.</p><p>He has never held a top military position, unlike the popular Mr. Gallant, an experienced former general.</p><p>After former President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017, Mr. Katz, then serving as a minister of transportation and intelligence, petitioned to name a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/world/middleeast/israeli-yisrael-katz-trump-station.html?searchResultPosition=7" title="">train station</a> after the American leader, “for his courageous and historic decision.” </p><p>Like the prime minister, Mr. Katz is a decades-long member of the Likud party and a supporter of the settlement movement.</p></div></div>
