    <h1>A Long Journey Home: After 50 Years, Back on the Reservation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Leonard Peltier had waited five decades to do something he had increasingly doubted he would ever be able to: say thank you, in person, to the fellow Native Americans and others who had spent those years fighting for his freedom.</p><p>Addressing a raucous crowd of 300 supporters on his home reservation on Wednesday, Mr. Peltier, now 80, pumped his right fist repeatedly and displayed remarkable stamina for a partly blind man who needs a walker. A day earlier, he had been released from a federal prison in Central Florida, where he had been serving two life sentences for the killing of two federal agents.</p><p>Now he was back with his people, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, in North Dakota. There he will be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest after President Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued a <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/20/statement-from-president-joe-biden-16/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clemency order</a> in one of his final acts before leaving office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I’m proud of the position I’ve taken — to fight for our rights to survival,” Mr. Peltier said during an eight-minute speech in which he expressed gratitude, but also defiance. “I’m so proud of the support you’re showing me, I’m having a hard time keeping myself from crying,” he said. “From the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came to my rescue, and they’ve been behind me ever since. It was worth it to me to be able to sacrifice for you.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/19nat-peltier-Dancers-wide-wjbf/19nat-peltier-Dancers-wide-wjbf-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/19nat-peltier-Dancers-wide-wjbf/19nat-peltier-Dancers-wide-wjbf-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/multimedia/19nat-peltier-Dancers-wide-wjbf/19nat-peltier-Dancers-wide-wjbf-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Dancers in Indigenous clothing smile and hug each other.

Greatness is justice, greatness is tolerance.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/leonard-peltier-prison-release-biden.html" title="">Mr. Peltier was a member of the American Indian Movement</a>, or AIM, an advocacy organization founded in 1968 that promoted civil rights, spoke out against police brutality and other abuses and sought to highlight the federal government’s history of violating treaties it had made with Native American tribes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the 1970s, militant members of the group clashed with federal authorities on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. They forcibly seized control of the Sioux village of Wounded Knee and fended off the authorities for 71 days.</p><p>Two years after the Wounded Knee standoff, with the relationship between Native American activists and federal law enforcement agencies still frayed, two F.B.I. agents — Jack Coler and Ronald Williams — tried to arrest a robbery suspect on the Pine Ridge reservation.</p><p>A shootout ensued, leaving the two agents and one activist dead. Mr. Peltier has admitted to firing his gun from a distance but has insisted that he acted in self-defense and was not the one who killed the agents. Of the more than 30 people who were present during the shootout, Mr. Peltier was the only one convicted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-12"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/autossell/Wounded-Knee-cover/Wounded-Knee-cover-jumbo.png" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/19/autossell/Wounded-Knee-cover/Wounded-Knee-cover-jumbo.png" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/02/19/134387_1_19nat-peltier-wounded-knee_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The occupation at Wounded Knee in 1973.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The house on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation that was the center of a gun battle between F.B.I. agents and Native Americans that resulted in the deaths of two agents and an activist.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Fred Jewell/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Exculpatory evidence that had helped to acquit two other AIM members accused in the killings was excluded from Mr. Peltier’s trial — an issue that has frequently been raised by his supporters as an example of injustice.</p><p>But in a letter in June 2024 opposing Mr. Peltier’s parole application, Christopher A. Wray, then the F.B.I. director, noted that Mr. Peltier had repeatedly lost in court on several issues, such as his attempts to downplay ballistics evidence tying him to the killings.</p><p>The order freeing him to return to North Dakota met the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-43859/biden-fbi-leonard-peltier-commutation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vehement objections</a> of many law enforcement officials.</p><p>“Peltier gets to go home — while neither Coler or Williams was afforded the same opportunity,” Michael J. Clark, president of the Society of Former Special Agents of the F.B.I., said in an email on Wednesday. “Peltier is a remorseless murderer and should have served out his life sentence in a federal prison.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Clarence M Kelley, left, who was then the director of the F.B.I., at graveside services for Ronald Williams, one of the agents who was killed, in 1975.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-18"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ronald Williams.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Federal Bureau of Investigation, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jack Coler.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Federal Bureau of Investigation, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Peltier made it home to the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation late Tuesday, as the sun was fading and temperatures were a dangerously cold minus 15 degrees — a 90-degree swing from the temperature at the most recent federal correctional facility where he had been held, in Coleman, Fla.</p><p>Dozens of residents greeted him with signs that read “<a href="https://www.startribune.com/its-a-historical-day-leonard-peltier-coming-home-tuesday-after-nearly-50-years-in-prison/601224731" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50 Years of Resistance</a>” as he was whisked to his new home in the town of Belcourt. The house was purchased by NDN Collective, an Indigenous rights group based in Rapid City, S.D., whose <a href="https://ndncollective.org/leonard-peltier-released-from-49-years-of-wrongful-incarceration/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leaders greeted Mr. Peltier</a> when he walked out of prison in Florida and accompanied him on a private plane ride back home, according to <a href="https://ndncollective.org/team/nick-tilsen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nick Tilsen</a>, the group’s founder and chief executive officer.</p><p>At a homecoming lunch on Wednesday, as Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song” played, banners and signs abounded. Some had clearly been used in previous protests — “Enough Is Enough: Free Leonard Peltier” — but there were also new ones, including a photo of Mr. Peltier with his Bureau of Prisons number, 89637-132, crossed out.</p><p>In his remarks, Mr. Peltier talked about how proud he was to call attention to Native issues, and described harsh conditions in prison, including being placed in sensory deprivation cells at some points.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Peltier mingled and received gifts from his supporters for more than an hour.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crowd of 300 supporters met Mr. Peltier as he arrived home after 50 years.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Even in his new circumstances under house arrest, he said, he will have to deal with many restrictions. “But it’s a lot better than being in a cell,” he added.</p><p>He then held court for more than an hour, like a Hall of Famer at an autograph signing, as more than 100 people lined up to say hello, present gifts, pose for photos or get something signed.</p><p>Some supporters cautioned that he would encounter a different world — some things better, some things worse — than the one he last experienced 50 years ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>State Representative Jayme Davis, a Democrat from the area who is also a member of the Turtle Mountain tribe, noted that many people had lost their jobs, and that there was deep anxiety about the future.</p><p>“Our people are facing immense challenges, especially as our state government moves forward with policies that make survival even harder,” said Ms. Davis, whose father attended school in Belcourt with Mr. Peltier. “But in the darkness of this moment, his homecoming, I feel, will be a beacon of light. His return carries a profound weight, almost as if there’s a message in the timing.”</p><p>Mr. Tilsen said that Mr. Peltier had expressed a desire to work on the issue of teenage suicides, having done some volunteer work as a young man on the Pine Ridge reservation. But he also said that Mr. Peltier — who has declined interview requests for the time being — would need some space.</p><p>“I think that everybody focuses on him being this iconic international human rights activist and leader, which he is,” he said. “But he’s also been institutionalized for 49 years. So he has to build a new normal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The sun rises on the Turtle Mountain Reservation on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Kirsten Noyes<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>David W.
