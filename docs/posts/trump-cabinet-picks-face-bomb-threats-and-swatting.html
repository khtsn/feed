Trump has picked to be cabinet nominees or for White House positions received threats on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, a transition spokeswoman said.</p><p>The F.B.I. said in a statement it was aware of “numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees.”</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition team, said several cabinet nominees and others were targeted with “violent, un-American threats to their lives and those who live with them.”</p><p>The threatening behavior included bomb threats and “swatting” — the act of contacting law enforcement to falsely claim a dangerous person is at a particular address. Swatting calls are designed to create a frantic armed police response to frighten, harass and endanger someone at their home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bomb threats and swatting calls are a growing problem for American law enforcement, as it has become easier to anonymously contact the authorities or leave threatening messages. Prominent public officials, schools and celebrities are often victims.</p><p>Ms. Leavitt said law enforcement and other authorities “acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted.”</p><p>Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, Trump’s pick to be ambassador to the United Nations, was notified by the police that a bomb threat had been made against her home, according to a <a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1861815886123778348" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from her office. She and her family were not there at the time.</p><p>The former congressman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/climate/trump-chooses-lee-zeldin-to-run-epa.html" title="">Lee Zeldin</a>, who is Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said the police had contacted him about a pipe bomb threat made to his home. The Zeldin family was not there at the time, he said in a statement.</p><p>Saloni Sharma, a White House spokeswoman, said President Biden had been briefed on the threats and was in touch with the Trump transition team. Mr. Biden and his administration, she said, “unequivocally condemn threats of political violence.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
