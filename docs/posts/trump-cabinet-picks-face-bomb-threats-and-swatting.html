    <h1>Trump Cabinet Picks Face Bomb Threats and ‘Swatting’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, Trump’s pick to be ambassador to the United Nations, was notified by the police that a bomb threat had been made against her home in Saratoga County, according to a <a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1861815886123778348" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from her office. She and her family were not there at the time.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/climate/trump-chooses-lee-zeldin-to-run-epa.html" title="">Lee Zeldin</a>, a former congressman from Long Island who is Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said the police had contacted him about a pipe bomb threat made to his home. The Zeldin family was not there at the time, he said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/us/politics/brooke-rollins-trump-agriculture.html" title="">Brooke Rollins</a>, whom Mr. Trump said he would nominate to be agriculture secretary, wrote on social media that she had also been targeted and thanked the police in Fort Worth, Texas, for their response.</p><p>Bomb threats and swatting calls are a growing problem for American law enforcement, as it has become easier to anonymously contact the authorities or leave threatening messages. Prominent public officials, schools and celebrities are often victims.</p><p>Saloni Sharma, a White House spokeswoman, said President Biden had been briefed on the threats and was in touch with the Trump transition team. Mr. Biden and his administration, she said, “unequivocally condemn threats of political violence.”</p></div></div>
