    <h1>Supreme Court to Consider Mexico’s Lawsuit Against U.S. Gun Makers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Access to guns is tightly controlled in Mexico, and it is nearly impossible for civilians to legally obtain the kinds of military-style weapons favored by the cartels. In their legal filings, lawyers for Mexico cited statistics showing that a majority of guns from Mexican crime scenes — between 70 and 90 percent — come from the United States. They also contend that gun dealers in the states that border Mexico sell twice as many weapons as dealers in other parts of the United States.</p><p>The argument before the court is focused on a threshold issue: whether a 2005 federal law prevents such a suit by Mexico against the gun makers. The law, the Protection of Lawful Arms in Commerce Act, was passed after a growing number of lawsuits aimed to hold the gun industry liable in mass shootings in the United States. It prohibits many types of lawsuits against gun manufacturers and sellers — but it allows claims to proceed if plaintiffs can show that their injuries were directly caused by knowing violations of firearms laws.</p><p>A federal trial judge in Boston had dismissed Mexico’s lawsuit, finding that it was barred by the 2005 legislation. The judge, F. Dennis Saylor IV, wrote that the law “bars exactly this type of action from being brought in federal and state courts.”</p><p>A unanimous three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit disagreed. The appeals court determined that Mexico’s case should be allowed to proceed because its argument that the companies had aided and abetted illegal gun sales in Mexico fit the law’s carve-out for suits.</p><p>The gun makers then asked the Supreme Court to take the case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1141.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Wesson Brands v.
