    <h1>What to Read this Summer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Readers, get ready: Summer books are here. These are the novels destined to grow plump with pool water. They’re the memoirs, biographies, histories and mysteries to lose yourself in while slathered with sunscreen or sitting strategically downwind of an air conditioning vent. They’ll whisk you away if you can’t escape and ground you when you’re far from home. They’re best served with Popsicles, peaches, soft-serve, ice water and lemonade. Cold beer, too.</p><p>For some of us at the Book Review, summer reading is our Super Bowl and Oscars Night. We search for new and clever ways to wax rhapsodic about the joy of turning pages in the sun — or during a July thunderstorm or in a hammock or by the light of a campfire. (To be honest, hammocks make me queasy, and I’ve only slept in a tent once.) Beach reads are my bailiwick, and I’ve written about them so many times I now have to cross-reference previous dispatches to find out if I’ve already opined about my favorite chair (Adirondack), sunglasses (cat eye) and soundtrack (seagulls).</p><p>But when Memorial Day weekend rolls around, I’m grateful all over again to toil in the realm of Slip ‘n Slides rather than stadiums or red carpets. There’s that stillness and lull, that sweaty, sandy, chlorinated, blueberry-scented sense of a break, even for those of us who are long out of school. Life’s requirements loosen, the box fan gets lugged down from the attic, books beckon.</p><p>The Book Review has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/books/review/new-fiction-books-summer-2025.html" title="">lists of 31 new novels</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/books/review/21-nonfiction-books-coming-this-summer.html" title="">21 nonfiction books</a> to carry you through the summer. Here are a few I’m excited about:</p><h2 id="link-6362e19e">Romance and thrills</h2><p>On the fiction front, I predict that <strong>Taylor Jenkins Reid’s “Atmosphere”</strong> will catch a big wave this summer, with its clandestine love story set in a 1980s space mission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>Amy Bloom’s novel, “I’ll Be Right Here”</strong> is as comfortingly titled as her debut story collection, “Come to Me,” and follows a group of friends over decades and generations, beginning in postwar Paris. (Speaking of interesting jobs, one character works as a masseuse to the writer Colette.)</p><p>Finally, I have my eye on <strong>“Our Last Resort” by Clémence Michallon,</strong> whose last thriller, “The Quiet Tenant,” stoked my insomnia at a lakeside rental with a shed not unlike the one where her protagonist was chained to a radiator. This time Michallon follows two cult escapees to a luxury hotel in the Utah desert. What can go wrong in a place with high thread-count sheets? A lot, apparently.</p><h2 id="link-6cd25e55">Moms and classic rock</h2><p>On the nonfiction side, <strong>“How to Lose Your Mother” by Molly Jong-Fast</strong>, is funnier than it sounds, and a tender, honest account of caring for an aging parent who happens to be famous. (Jong-Fast’s mother is Erica Jong, author of “Fear of Flying,” among other trailblazing and autobiographical works.)</p><p>I’m also looking forward to <strong>Sophie Elmhirst’s “A Marriage at Sea,”</strong> about a married couple who, in the 1970s, were stranded on a tiny rubber raft in the ocean for 117 days, and <strong>Peter Ames Carlin’s “Tonight in Jungleland,” </strong>about the making of Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run” album.</p><p>And because it too has a Jersey Shore angle, I’m curious about <strong>“Baddest Man” by Mark Kriegel</strong>, which follows Mike Tyson’s complicated, often troubling journey from Brooklyn to Atlantic City and beyond. It sounds like an intriguing accompaniment for my “Rocky”-style workout, a leisurely stroll on the beach with occasional lunges for pretty shells.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Migrants going from Panama to Colombia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Federico Rios for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><ul><li><p>Thousands of Venezuelans migrants, targeted by the Trump administration, are choosing to self-deport. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/americas/panama-boats-self-deportation.html" title="">They face a perilous journey home</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Republicans’ domestic agenda faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/fiscal-hawks-senate-house-bill.html" title="">a difficult path in the Senate</a> after two fiscal conservatives said they would seek significant changes.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Trump has expressed hostility toward civil rights protections — unless those measures are used to remedy what he sees as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html" title="">disenfranchisement of white men</a>, Erica Green writes.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-33ffbf21">Middle East</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In northern Gaza. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Illustration by Paul Sahre</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>American men are getting worse at friendship.</p><p>Only 26 percent of men reported having six or more close friends, a 2024 survey found.
