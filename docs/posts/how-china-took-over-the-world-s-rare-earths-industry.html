Panicked Japanese executives appeared on television to warn that they were running out of the critical raw materials.</p><p>The embargo, prompted by a territorial dispute, lasted only seven weeks. But it changed the global supply chain for these metals. When the embargo was over, China took forceful control of its mineral bounty. Top officials in Beijing rooted out corruption, crushed smugglers and consolidated the industry under state control.</p><p>The world was put on notice, especially Japan and the United States, two of China’s biggest customers for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/climate/rare-earths-critical-minerals-china-united-states.html" title="">rare earth metals</a> used in everything from cars to smartphones to missiles. Governments from both countries drafted detailed plans for how to mitigate their dependence on China. Japan has largely followed through on its plans and today can source the minerals from Australia.</p><p>Not the United States. Even after 15 years, the country is still almost entirely reliant on China for the processing of rare earth metals. As a result, American automakers, aerospace companies and defense contractors have been left vulnerable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Angry about President Trump’s tariffs, China has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html" title="">suspended all exports</a> of certain rare earths, as well as the even more valuable magnets made from them.</p><p>These small yet powerful magnets — no bigger than a ring for a person’s finger, yet with 15 times the force of a conventional iron magnet<strong> </strong>— are an inexpensive and often overlooked component of electric motors. They are used in electric and gasoline-powered cars as well as robots, drones, offshore wind turbines, missiles, fighter jets and many other products.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rare earth magnet at an MP Materials facility in Fort Worth, Texas.

The gangsters had been smuggling up to half of China’s annual rare earths production out of the country.</p><p>Weeks after the embargo ended, Beijing took revenge. Government forces acting under national security orders stormed the valley near Longnan in Jiangxi Province where much of the world’s heavy rare earth minerals were produced. They seized the privately run mines and jailed thousands of people across southern China. Regulation of the industry was transferred from local governments to Beijing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A mine for heavy rare earth metals outside Longnan in south-central China’s Jiangxi Province.

During a visit last week to the valley without the knowledge of the local authorities, there was no sign of the thugs who used to guard southern China’s rare earth mines.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>China has recently developed its own magnet industry instead of shipping the materials to magnet factories in Japan. Beijing has poured money into building advanced magnet factories in Ganzhou, a city near Longnan.</p><p>China now produces 90 percent of the world’s magnets. Further construction was underway at two of Ganzhou’s largest magnet factories last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A factory making rare earth magnets in Ganzhou, China.

He called for “intensifying the dependence of international industrial supply chains on China, forming a powerful capacity to counter and deter deliberate supply cutoffs by foreigners.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Japan also took far-reaching actions after the 2010 embargo. Its manufacturers began holding enough rare earths in inventory to meet up to two years of their own needs. They also started looking overseas.</p><p>The conglomerate Sumitomo Group, with financial backing from the Japanese government, helped support the development of Lynas, an Australian mining company. Lynas mines and refines 60 percent of Japan’s light rare earths, which are mixed with small quantities of heavy rare earths to make rare earth magnets. And the company is preparing to start refining heavy rare earths for Japanese manufacturers this summer in Malaysia, although initially in tiny quantities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jars containing rare earth minerals produced by Lynas, an Australian mining company, from its Mount Weld operations.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Melanie Burton/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Japan’s biggest magnet manufacturers — Proterial, Shin-Etsu Chemical Company and TDK Corporation — have moved some production from Japan to China to have reliable access to rare earths, and also to Vietnam, where labor costs are low. But they have also kept considerable production in Japan.</p><p>The U.S. rare earth magnet industry started with a subsidiary of General Motors in northern Indiana in the 1980s. But factories shut down and moved to China and Singapore.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>After the embargo in 2010, the Japanese company Hitachi Metals, which changed its name in 2023 to Proterial, responding to concern from the administration of former President Barack Obama, built a rare earth magnets factory in North Carolina from 2011 to 2013.</p><p>The Hitachi Metals factory, with several dozen employees, had higher costs than the giant complexes being built in Ganzhou. American companies proved unwilling to pay extra for magnets produced in the United States and switched to Chinese suppliers. Hitachi closed the factory in 2020 and the equipment went into storage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The MP Materials rare earth open-pit mine in Mountain Pass, Calif., the only active rare earth mine in the United States.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Steve Marcus/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Today the only active rare earth mine in the United States is in Mountain Pass, Calif. Its operator, MP Materials, plans to start ramping up commercial production of rare earth magnets at the end of the year at a factory in Texas. But even when running at full speed, the facility will produce in a year the equivalent of a day of China’s production.</p><p>Chinese factories supply thousands of tons of rare earth magnets each year to the country’s manufacturers of electric cars and offshore wind turbines — two industries that Mr. Trump has criticized.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Like magnet production, rare earth mining has also had an uneven history in the United States. The Mountain Pass mine produced a majority of the world’s rare earths from 1965 until 1995, when China began flooding the global market with all manner of low-cost exports.</p><p>The mine closed in 2002, partly because of ever stricter environmental regulations by California. A $1.5 billion upgrade started in 2010, but mining did not resume until 2017 — and then the mine had to ship its ore to China for processing at low-cost refineries there. Only now has the mine begun refining a large share of its production.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A forklift operator arranging bags of bastnaesite concentrate for shipping at the MP Materials rare earth mine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Steve Marcus/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Zoning and environmental regulations make it hard to open a rare earth mine in the United States. Opening a rare earth mine in the United States takes 29 years, said Mark Smith, the chairman and chief executive of NioCorp Developments, which has obtained construction permits to build a mine in Nebraska.</p><p>“You can spend a whole career getting a mine up and running,” Mr. Smith said.</p><p>By contrast, mines in China can be opened quickly and do not have to undergo the same kind of rigorous regulatory approval.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Underpinning all the problems is that the global market for the minerals is tiny next to other kinds of mining, like copper.</p><p>Few American companies have wanted to make big investments in rare earths only to face the risk, as Hitachi found, that customers prefer cheaper products from government-backed industries in China.</p><p>“U.S. companies have been reluctant to take the plunge,” said David Sandalow, who oversaw critical minerals policy in the Obama administration</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Keith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times.
