China is the country of origin for the second-largest group of international students in the United States, and many universities rely on Chinese and other international students paying full tuition for a substantial part of their annual revenue.</p><p>American universities have also benefited over many decades by drawing some of the most talented students from China and other countries. Chinese students and researchers are represented in large numbers in university science laboratories.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Although Mr. Rubio’s written statement did not define “critical fields,” the phrase most likely refers to research in the physical sciences. In recent years, American officials have expressed concerns about the Chinese government recruiting U.S.-trained scientists, though there is no evidence of such scientists working for China in large numbers.</p><p>It is unclear how quickly the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security will cancel the visas and revoke the status of affected Chinese students now in the United States. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or I.C.E., has aggressively moved to detain some students whose visas or residency status have been canceled by Mr. Rubio. That has led to lawsuits against the Trump administration.</p><p>Until now, family members of most Chinese Communist Party officials could study at American universities. Many top party officials sent children to American universities in recent decades. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, sent his daughter, Xi Mingze, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/world/asia/bo-xilai-scandal-in-china-may-help-vice-president-xi-jinping.html" title="">attend Harvard</a> under a pseudonym in the early 2010s. Harvard administrators and a few professors knew who she was.</p><p>Around the same time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/world/asia/son-of-fallen-chinese-official-enrolls-at-columbia-law-school.html" title="">Bo Guagua</a>, the son of a prominent former Politburo member who is now imprisoned in China, got a master’s degree at Harvard Kennedy School and attended Columbia Law School.</p><p>In 2020, officials in the first Trump administration decided to try to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/china-hong-kong-trump-student-visas.html" title="">cancel the visas</a> of thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers who had direct ties to military universities in China. It was the first time the U.S. government had moved to bar a category of Chinese students from getting access to American universities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A <a href="https://www.iie.org/news/us-hosts-more-than-1-1-million-intl-students-at-higher-education-institutions-all-time-high/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> published last year by the State Department and the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit group, said that China had the <a href="https://opendoorsdata.org/annual-release/international-students/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second-highest</a> share of the more than 1.1 million international students who enrolled in American higher education institutions in the 2023-24 term. Around 275,000 students came from China, behind India, with about 330,000 students. The number of Chinese students had dropped 4 percent from the previous academic year, while the number from India had surged by 23 percent.</p><p>In another move on visa restrictions, Mr. Rubio announced that the State Department would not give visas to foreign officials who engage in the censorship of the speech of American citizens.</p><p>“It is unacceptable for foreign officials to issue or threaten arrest warrants on U.S. citizens or U.S. residents for social media posts on American platforms while physically present on U.S. soil,” he said in a statement.</p><p>He added that “it is similarly unacceptable for foreign officials to demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies or engage in censorship activity that reaches beyond their authority and into the United States.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edward Wong reports on global affairs, U.S. foreign policy and the State Department for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
