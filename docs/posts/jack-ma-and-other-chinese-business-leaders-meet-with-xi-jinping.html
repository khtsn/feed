The reports did not describe the nature of the discussions or list everyone who attended.</p><p>It was the first gathering between Mr. Xi and corporate leaders since President Trump targeted China in a series of tariffs, which he said were aimed at reducing the enormous American trade deficit with the country.</p><p>Among investors, reports that the meeting might take place had sparked optimism that Beijing was getting serious about bolstering the private sector, which has taken a back seat as Mr. Xi has put greater emphasis on state-owned enterprises.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Stocks in Hong Kong, where many major Chinese companies trade, have risen in recent weeks on optimism about private companies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/business/deepseek-owner-china-ai.html" title="">DeepSeek</a>, a Chinese start-up that said it had built a powerful artificial intelligence program using far fewer computer chips than any Silicon Valley giant in the field. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/deepseek-china-lianng-wenfeng.html" title="">Liang Wenfeng</a>, the founder of DeepSeek, was at the meeting on Monday, according to Chinese media.</p><p>Fred Hu, founder of the investment firm Primavera Capital in Hong Kong, called the meeting a symbolic “course correction.”</p><p>“In recent years the private sector has been hit by policies, politics and regulations,” Mr. Hu said.</p><p>The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong initially rallied more than 1 percent on Monday, but it gave up those gains and was trading lower in the afternoon.</p><p>Chinese social media was bursting with speculation about who had been at the meeting. The symposium quickly became one of the top five topics of discussion on Weibo, one of the most popular online platforms in China.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For many, the most important question ahead of the meeting was whether Mr. Ma, the Alibaba Group founder, would be in attendance.</p><p>It was the first time Mr. Ma had been seen in public with Mr. Xi since Beijing slammed the brakes on the initial public offering of his Ant Group in 2020, after he publicly criticized Chinese regulators for stifling innovation. The move by regulators to stop what would have been the world’s biggest I.P.O. was a key development in a multiyear government crackdown on Chinese entrepreneurs. Mr. Ma has kept largely out of the public eye since then.</p><p>Mr. Hu said that Mr. Ma’s presence at the meeting sent a message “that successful private entrepreneurs will be respected rather than penalized.”</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How Altman Won Over Trump: </strong>After helping President Trump get elected, Elon Musk was poised to dominate America’s A.I. policies.
