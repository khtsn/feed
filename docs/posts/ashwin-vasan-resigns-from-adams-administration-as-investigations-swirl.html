My wife and three young children have served alongside me, bearing the brunt of my absence and shouldering so much,” Dr. Vasan said in a statement. “I’m grateful for their love and have chosen that now it is time to support them and their well-being.”</p><p>A City Hall spokesman, William Fowler, said Dr. Vasan’s departure was not related to the federal investigations, and the commissioner affirmed that in a brief interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m so far away from that world, and my focus has been on the health of the city,” Dr. Vasan said of the investigations. “I don’t think anyone wants to see that kind of environment around us, because we want our mayor and the administration to be successful, because we want the city to be successful.”</p><p>Mr. Adams praised Dr. Vasan’s tenure.</p><p>“His expertise as a mental health expert, coupled with his training as a public health professional, have proven indispensable to our city over the past two and a half years as we’ve handled rising Covid rates, mpox outbreaks, and a mental health crisis both on our streets and in our schools,” the mayor said in a statement.</p><p>The resignation reflects the mounting pressure facing Mr. Adams and his administration, and underscores concerns about the mayor’s ability to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/nyregion/eric-adams-scandal.html" title="">retain and attract top staff</a> and remain focused on governing the largest city in the country amid at least four separate criminal investigations of his campaign and closest advisers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index-articleLarge-v2.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Tracking Investigations in Eric Adams’s Orbit</h2><p>Several federal corruption inquiries have reached into the world of Mayor Eric Adams of New York, who faces re-election next year.
