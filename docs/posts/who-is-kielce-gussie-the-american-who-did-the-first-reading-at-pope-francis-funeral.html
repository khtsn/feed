As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ, he is Lord of all. You yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed. How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all that he did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, but God raised him on the third day and caused him to appear, not to all people, but to us, who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/26/26visualUploader-63390-cover/26visualUploader-63390-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Kielce Gussie, a reporter with Vatican News, read the Acts of the Apostles at Pope Francis’ funeral Mass on Saturday.</span></figcaption></figure><div></div><p><time datetime="2025-04-26T10:16:17-04:00"><span>April 26, 2025</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The honor of delivering the first reading at Pope Francis’ funeral Mass on Saturday fell to Kielce Gussie, an American who works as a reporter with Vatican News.</p><p>It was, she said on social media, “a great way to say goodbye” to the pontiff.</p><p>In a strong, resonant voice before the many thousands of mourners who had gathered in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, Ms. Gussie read from the Acts of the Apostles 10: 34-43, a Bible verse <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/26/world/pope-francis-funeral" title="">that Francis chose for the service</a> and that holds large significance for Catholics.</p><p>Ms. Gussie, 28, grew up in Florida, and graduated from Mount St. Mary’s University in Maryland with a degree in theology, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kielce-gussie-84591b139/?originalSubdomain=it" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her LinkedIn profile</a>.
