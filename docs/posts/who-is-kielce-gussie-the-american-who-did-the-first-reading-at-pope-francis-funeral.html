    <h1>Who Is Kielce Gussie, the American Who Did the First Reading at Pope Francis’ Funeral?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The honor of delivering the first reading at Pope Francis’ funeral Mass on Saturday fell to Kielce Gussie, an American who works as a reporter with Vatican News.</p><p>It was, she said on social media, “a great way to say goodbye” to the pontiff.</p><p>In a strong, resonant voice before the many thousands of mourners who had gathered in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, Ms. Gussie read from the Acts of the Apostles 10: 34-43, a Bible verse <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/26/world/pope-francis-funeral" title="">that Francis chose for the service</a> and that holds large significance for Catholics.</p><p>Ms. Gussie, 28, grew up in Florida, and graduated from Mount St. Mary’s University in Maryland with a degree in theology, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kielce-gussie-84591b139/?originalSubdomain=it" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her LinkedIn profile</a>. She began working in Rome in 2019, according to her profile, and last October joined Vatican News — a news agency that Francis created to bolster news coverage of the church and the Vatican.</p><p>“I’m really happy to be here because it’s a great way to say goodbye to Pope Francis,” Ms. Gussie <a href="https://x.com/Guzik_Paulina/status/1916040876750483865" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media outside St. Peter’s Basilica</a> on Saturday morning before the Mass. She added that her last memory of Francis was from her birthday. “He gave me a little blessing,” she said. “It’s really a special way to spend my birthday.”</p><p>She said it had been difficult to see Francis grow frail in his final days, “but he gave everything until the end.”</p></div></div>
