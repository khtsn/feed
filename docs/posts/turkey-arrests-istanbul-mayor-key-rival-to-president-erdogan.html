Mr. Erdogan’s defenders cite his history of electoral victories as proof of his popularity.</p><p>Mr. Imamoglu had on three occasions since 2019 beaten candidates chosen by Mr. Erdogan to run Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and economic powerhouse. And Turkey’s main opposition party was expected to formally nominate him as its presidential candidate during a primary on Sunday.</p><p>The head of the main opposition party, Ozgur Ozel, called on party members to go ahead with the scheduled primary vote.</p><p>“We are faced with a coup attempt against our next president,” Mr. Ozel <a href="https://x.com/eczozgurozel/status/1902220327649697913" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>.</p><p>Turkey’s next presidential election is scheduled for 2028, but Parliament is widely expected to call for early elections before then.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Erdogan is in the second of the two terms he is allowed by the Constitution. But an early election would allow him to run again, on the grounds that he did not complete his second term. Many in the opposition also want an early vote because they believe that chronic inflation, which has been exacerbated by Mr. Erdogan’s policies, will help them at the polls.</p><p>Mr. Erdogan, 71, and officials in his ruling Justice and Development Party have not publicly discussed who their candidate will be. But Mr. Erdogan has been Turkey’s predominate politician for more than two decades, and he has no clear successor. So he is widely expected to run.</p><p>Sinem Adar, a Turkey expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said the government had been laying the groundwork to exclude Mr. Imamoglu from the race for some time, given the challenge he would pose to Mr. Erdogan and the ruling party’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/world/middleeast/turkey-election-results.html" title="">poor showing in local elections last year</a>.</p><p>“There is a lot of discontent in the population,” she said.</p><p>But the prevailing international mood, including the rise of far-right parties in Europe and the Trump administration’s nationalist focus, could make it easier for Mr. Erdogan to act against his rivals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“The international context and the geopolitics help Erdogan double down on the dissidents, on the opposition,” Ms. Adar said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers blocked roads after Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest on Wednesday as the authorities sought to head off protests.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emrah Gurel/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, which promotes local democracy on the continent, <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/congress/-/council-of-europe-congress-strongly-condemns-the-arrest-of-istanbul-mayor" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the arrest, saying that it appeared aimed at exerting “pressure on a political figure considered as one of the main candidates in forthcoming presidential elections.”</p><p>Police arrested Mr. Imamoglu just after dawn at his house. Prosecutors said that related arrest warrants had been issued for more than 100 people, and police also detained two Istanbul district mayors and a number of Mr. Imamoglu’s senior aides.</p><p>The Istanbul prosecutor’s office said that Mr. Imamoglu was accused of leading a criminal organization. Prosecutors say he took part in corrupt practices in municipal business and accused him of engaging in bribery, fraud, money laundering, personal enrichment and bid rigging.</p><p>He also faces accusations of aiding a terrorist organization linked to his coordination with a pro-Kurdish political party during last year’s municipal elections, prosecutors said. Mr. Imamoglu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/world/middleeast/turkey-election-results.html" title="">won that election handily</a> against a candidate backed by Mr. Erdogan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Imamoglu has yet to be indicted on specific charges related to these accusations, but he could be kept in detention while prosecutors pursue their investigation.</p><p>The office of Istanbul’s governor, who is appointed by Mr. Erdogan, took steps on Wednesday to head off protests about the arrests.</p><p>Public demonstrations have been banned in the city for four days and two subway stations were closed, including in Taksim Square, a central transportation hub and large plaza where rallies have often been held.</p><p>Turkey also restricted access to social media platforms including X, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1902230361968427206" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to NetBlocks</a>, an internet monitor.</p><p>By midafternoon, small, scattered protests had broken out around Istanbul.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Imamoglu at a rally in Istanbul before local elections last year.
