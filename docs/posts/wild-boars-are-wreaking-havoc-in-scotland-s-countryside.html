And drivers on local roads have encountered traveling boars, which can run at up to 30 miles an hour, according to one local resident, who said a friend’s car collided with a 132-pound animal, totaling the vehicle, as well as killing the boar.</p></div><div><div><p>Mr. Jamieson, a former police officer who runs a real estate business from his home, first noticed something amiss around six years ago when his lawn was torn to pieces. He said he has to patch the grass five or six times a year and is afraid to let his dogs run freely. This has brought mixed emotions.</p><p>“I don’t like seeing animals killed at all, even a rabbit,” he said, standing outside his home with its spectacular view of the loch. Boars, however, are different, he added.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An aerial view of green countryside, with a lake and mountains." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp/24scotland-boar-dispatch-02-fmcp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wild boars are roaming the roads and hills around Loch Ness.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Since he first noticed the problem, he has had to hire hunters to shoot around 50 boars on his 8.5 acres of land, including one whose carcass weighed about 309 pounds. “I took a look at it,” he said. “My god, I’d never seen teeth like it.”</p><p>Nearby, close to the village of Grotaig, Catherine Mclennan, 52, recalled a close call one night when she shone a flashlight at what turned out to be a boar. “I looked at it. It looked at me,” said Ms. Mclennan, a fifth-generation farmer. “It was a scary moment because I thought, ‘What the hell do I do with this?’”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The animal disappeared before she had to decide. But two lambs she left out overnight were not so lucky.</p><p>“I went down the next morning to look for them, and the carcass was literally bare,” she said, referring to one of the lambs and speaking close to the paddock where she keeps three horses. “The fleece was at the back end literally in a big lump, and you are like, ‘What the heck, what’s doing this?’”</p><p>In fact, boars spend much of their time foraging for roots, using their snouts to turn over land. But they also eat smaller creatures, including lambs, small deer and ground-nesting birds like pheasant and grouse, and their eggs.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The Scottish government needs to take more action” about the boars, said Catherine Mclennan, a fifth-generation farmer who lives near Loch Ness.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Once native to Scotland, boars were hunted to extinction, probably <a href="https://www.nature.scot/doc/naturescot-research-report-1288-updated-non-native-species-risk-assessment-feral-pigs-scotland" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around the 13th century</a>. Several attempts to reintroduce them for hunting foundered. Then, sometime in the 20th century, a few that had been imported from continental Europe escaped or were released from captivity, probably after having been brought to country estates as a novelty, local residents suspect.</p></div><div><div><p>These days, Scotland’s population of boars — or feral pigs — may have “reached the low thousands,” according to NatureScot, the agency that advises the Scottish government on wildlife and other similar issues. But local residents believe that is an underestimate, and some say the agency isn’t doing enough to help.</p><p>“The Scottish government needs to take more action as well as compensating farmers for the damage that’s been done to their livestock and damage that’s being done to their ground,” Ms. Mclennan said.</p><p>NatureScot declined to make an official available for an interview, but said in a statement that it recognized that boars can “breed prolifically and, if uncontrolled, their rooting behavior can cause damage to the environment and to property.”</p><p>The bottom line, the agency says, is that the responsibility for dealing with the boars lies with landowners.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As well as foraging for roots, wild boars eat smaller creatures, including lambs, small deer and ground-nesting birds.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Scotland’s population of boars may have “reached the low thousands,” according to the Scottish agency that advises the government on wildlife and other similar issues.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>When Mr. Jamieson needed to address his boar problem, he turned to Robert Sanderson, 41, an ambulance dispatch controller whose side business, Highland Deer Management, helps landowners cope with the sometimes exploding local deer population. Mr. Sanderson shoots the deer and sells the meat. But boars have become a significant part of his work, he said.</p></div><div><div><p>On a recent night, Mr. Sanderson drove along the loch with his business partner, Grant Clark, 32, who works in auto repairs. The men, who both live in Inverness, made their way to a hide-out with a view of an open hillside and waited for a while, but no boar showed up. So they thought they were done for the evening.</p><p>But 10 minutes after he left the area, Mr. Sanderson’s phone pinged when a boar triggered a sensor on a camera trap near the hillside.</p><p>Mr. Sanderson studied the image — “probably going to be 50 kilos-ish” — before he and Mr. Clark hurried back to a vantage point. They concluded that the boar was a solitary female, without youngsters that would starve without it, and therefore a legitimate target.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert Sanderson, right, and Grant Clark run a business that helps landowners with the boar problem.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Minutes later, a single shot rang out as a boar was struck just below the ear, killing it instantly. The animal rolled a few feet downhill and lay prone.</p><p>Mr. Sanderson cut into the boar, removing its intestines for other animals to forage, and dragged away the heavy carcass to sell for meat.</p><p>Not everyone near the loch is unhappy to see boars in the neighborhood.</p><p>Alex Davies is the estate manager at <a href="https://www.highlandsrewilding.co.uk/bunloit-estate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bunloit</a>, a 1,200-acre property purchased in 2020 by Highlands Rewilding, an environmental group.
