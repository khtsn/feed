Its second spacecraft, named Resilience, launched in January and has been taking a roundabout path to the moon, entering orbit last month.</p><p>Resilience descended to the lunar surface, but its current status remains unknown.</p><h2 id="link-2076a00f">What happened to the Ispace lander?</h2><p>Resilience, also known as the Hakuto-R Mission 2 lander, was scheduled to land at 3:17 p.m. Eastern time Thursday. (Itis Friday at the company’s mission control in Tokyo.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That time came and went with the spacecraft performing its landing sequence without any certainty in the moment about the spacecraft’s fate. But the looks of silent concern in the control room were eerily similar to what unfolded during Ispace’s first mission.</p><p>“At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with RESILIENCE, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,” Ispace announced in <a href="https://x.com/ispace_inc/status/1930732253241630975" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on the website X</a> nearly two hours after the schedule landing time.</p><p>A news conference with an update is scheduled for 8 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.</p><h2 id="link-6140d2f8">What is Ispace, and what happened during its last moon mission?</h2><p>Ispace emerged from a Japanese team that had aimed to win the Google Lunar X Prize, which offered $20 million for the first privately financed venture to land on the moon. None of the X Prize teams got off the ground before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/science/google-lunar-x-prize-moon.html" title="">the competition expired in 2018</a>. Takeshi Hakamada, the leader of the Japanese X Prize team, raised private financing to push forward and is the chief executive of Ispace.</p><p>The first Ispace mission aimed to land in the middle of Atlas Crater, a 54-mile-wide depression in the northeast quadrant on the near side of the moon. But Ispace lost contact with the lander during its final descent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The packed-up lander ready for encapsulation in a white clean room." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/05/multimedia/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz/05HS-moon-landing-02-pvfz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b93156ce-c731-5ed3-be39-f14f08f426d0" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Resilience lunar lander before its Jan. 15 launch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">ispace, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>That spacecraft was originally supposed to land at Lacus Somniorum, a flat plain. It turned out that Ispace had embarrassingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/science/moon-crash-japan-ispace.html" title="">not adequately updated the spacecraft’s navigation software</a> when it changed the landing site to Atlas Crater. The software was confused as the lander passed over the two-mile-high crater rim and erroneously concluded that it was closer to the ground than it actually was.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The spacecraft was still about three miles above the surface when it thought it should be touching down. It then exhausted its propellant and plunged to its destruction, slamming into Atlas Crater at more than 200 miles per hour.</p><h2 id="link-70d6df77">Where was Resilience trying to land?</h2><p>Resilience did not heading back to Atlas Crater, although the landing site was in roughly the same neighborhood — on the near side of the moon in the northern hemisphere. The spacecraft intended to set down in the middle of a lava plain known as Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold.</p><h2 id="link-2ea7ffed">What was the Resilience lander carrying?</h2><p>Resilience is essentially the same design as the Mission 1 spacecraft, but it had different payloads aboard.</p><p>Those include a water electrolyzer experiment, which splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen; a food production experiment; a deep-space radiation probe; and a small rover named Tenacious that was developed and built by Ispace’s European subsidiary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Although this is not a NASA mission, it will collect two soil samples — one scooped up by the rover, the other from material that settles on the spacecraft’s landing pads — and sell them to the agency for $5,000 each.</p><p>The transactions have no scientific value, because the samples will remain on the moon. Instead, they are meant to help strengthen the United States government’s position that while no nation on Earth can claim sovereignty of the moon or other parts of the solar system under the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, nations and companies can own and profit from what they extract from the moon.</p><p>Resilience and Tenacious are also designed to operate for about two weeks, until the sun sets at the end of the lunar day.</p><h2 id="link-7ae4dd28">Why is there a little red house bolted to the back of the rover?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A little red model house created by the artist Mikael Genberg attached to Resilience.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ispace Mission 2, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The Tenacious rover is carrying a project called Moonhouse by a Swedish artist, Mikael Genberg — a miniature model of a small red Swedish house.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It is nothing really on Earth,” Mr. Genberg said Wednesday during a news conference. “It is small, and it is really insignificant. But on the moon, it will be a monument. It will be the only colorful thing on the moon.”</p><p>(The colors of spacecraft are typically limited to a palette of white, black, gold and silver. The engineering team for Moonhouse had to develop a special space-certified red paint.)</p><p>Mr. Genberg worked for 25 years on the notion of putting something familiar in a most unfamiliar environment. “I had the idea that the thing that really would create perspective would be a red house on the surface of the moon,” he said.</p><p>The rover is to be deployed from the lander a couple of days after landing. It will drop the house — which measures about 4.7 inches long, 3.1 inches wide and 3.9 inches high — onto the surface, and then drive around to take some pictures of it.</p><h2 id="link-d092ffe">What else has landed on the moon this year?</h2><p>Resilience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/science/nasa-spacex-launch-lunar-landers.html" title="">shared a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket</a> with another lunar lander, Blue Ghost from Firefly Aerospace of Cedar Park, Texas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Blue Ghost spacecraft, financed by NASA, took a quicker path to the moon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/science/blue-ghost-firefly-mission-1-moon-landing.html" title="">landing on March 2</a>, and completed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/21/science/blue-ghost-moon-landing.html" title="">an almost flawless two-week mission</a>.</p><p>Another NASA-financed lander, by Intuitive Machines of Houston, landed on the moon a few days later, but toppled over. Although Intuitive Machines was able to communicate with the lander, named Athena, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/science/intuitive-machines-moon-lander-dead.html" title="">it ran out of energy a day later</a> and most of the mission’s objectives were not accomplished.</p><p>Last year, Intuitive Machine’s first lunar lander, Odysseus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/science/moon-lander-intuitive-nasa.html" title="">also toppled over</a>.</p><p>Two other robotic landers are scheduled to launch this year, one from Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh and one from Blue Origin of Kent, Wash.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/science/nasa-moon-rover-astrolab-astrobotic.html" title="">Astrobotic’s lander, Griffin, will transport a rover</a>, built by another company Venturi Astrolab, to the moon.</p><p>Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is planning to send a robotic lander to test out technologies that will be used in a larger spacecraft designed to take NASA astronauts to the lunar surface.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
