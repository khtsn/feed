The cardinals — the prelates who are just below the pope in the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy — will vote by secret ballot for a successor to Pope Francis until one candidate earns a two-thirds majority.</p><p>While we may not know what’s being said during the conclave — it is off limits to outsiders — we do have a pretty good idea what it will look like. During the gathering, the cardinals will follow specific instructions and use several distinctive objects to facilitate the process, many steeped in tradition.</p><p>Here’s a look at some of those objects, and the meaning behind them.</p><h2 id="link-2f178691">Voting Instruments</h2><p>When the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel, they will be sitting in rows of simple wooden tables. At one end of the chapel, a large table is set up for those who run the voting, according to the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Universi Dominici Gregis</a>, or U.D.G., one of the documents used to govern the papal transition.</p><p>The room also contains voting instruments, including an urn to receive the ballots, a set of wooden balls, and a needle and twine. The urn is used to collect the ballots, rectangular pieces of paper printed with the Latin phrase “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The ballots contain a space where each cardinal writes in the name of his chosen candidate. The ballots are placed in the urn and are removed for counting after all the cardinals have voted.</p><p>The wooden balls are used to keep track of the ballots. The balls have numbers written on them that correspond to the number of cardinals voting in the conclave. As the ballots are being counted, an attendant removes one of the wooden balls for each ballot, to ensure that the number matches the number of cardinals, <a href="https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&amp;d=ca19581024-01.2.35&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN--------" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Catholic Advocate</a>, formerly a newspaper of the Archdiocese of Newark, N.J. If the numbers don’t match, the ballots must be burned without being read and another vote is conducted immediately, according to the U.D.G.</p><p>As the ballots are being read, they are pierced with the needle through the word “Eligo” and strung onto the thread, “so that the ballots can be more securely preserved,” according to the U.D.G.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/07/multimedia/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/07/multimedia/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/07/multimedia/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A member of the clergy, dressed in a black cassock and wearing glasses, reads a document with the Vatican’s stamp on it." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/07/multimedia/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/07/multimedia/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/07/multimedia/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf-jumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/07/multimedia/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf/07pope-conclave-objects-gmpf-superJumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/387d9ed3-7c2e-53c4-8bbd-fc31fac64128" decoding="async" width="600" height="600"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the clergy and conclave staff taking the oath of secrecy in the Pauline Chapel earlier this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Vatican</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-34f352e0">The Oath of Secrecy</h2><p>The conclave is a secretive institution, and many steps are taken to prevent leaks, including restricting the cardinals’ use of phones, the internet and newspapers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The members of the College of Cardinals, the body that will elect the pope, must also swear and sign an oath of secrecy, according to the U.D.G. The oath reads, in part: “I will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme Pontiff.”</p><p>The cardinals also must promise not to record anything in Vatican City during the time of the election. The punishment for breaking the oath is “automatic” excommunication, according to the oath.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A temporary stove in the Sistine Chapel in a photo provided by the Vatican.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The Vatican</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-306c8280">The Stove</h2><p>The weekend before the conclave began, Vatican workers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vatican-conclave-sistine-chapel-stove-89ce55cc96c1a69c613435e47740c335" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">installed a simple stove</a> in which ballots would be burned in the Sistine Chapel.

Black smoke means that the cardinals have not yet reached the requisite majority; white smoke means that a new pope has been elected and voting is over.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-48c2eb86">The Seal</h2><p>At the beginning of the conclave, the Apostolic Palace, which contains the Sistine Chapel, is closed to the public. On Wednesday, members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard placed beaded ropes with the guard’s seal at the entrances to the palace to ensure privacy and maintain secrecy for the cardinals.</p><p>The Vatican City government also planned to deactivate cellphone service within its territory for the duration of the conclave, starting on Wednesday afternoon.</p><h2 id="link-1ccc3f8">The Papal Vestments</h2><p>After a pope is elected, he is taken to the “Room of Tears,” a small room next to the Sistine Chapel, where he will put on the white papal cassock for the first time. Garments in <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/263873/papal-tailor-has-next-popes-cassock-almost-ready-in-3-different-sizes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three sizes are prepared</a> and kept in the room, since no one knows who — or what size — the next pope will be.</p><p>The room is known as the “Room of Tears” because there are accounts of previous popes becoming overwhelmed with emotion in the room, and being moved to tears, after their election. After the pope puts on the vestments, he is introduced to the public for the first time.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jonathan Wolfe is a Times reporter based in London, covering breaking news.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/roman-catholic-church">Roman Catholic Church</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Contenders to Be the Next Pope</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Pietro Parolin:</strong> The Vatican’s secretary of state is someone who cardinals say could have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/pope-conclave-cardinal-pietro-parolin.html">a steady, bureaucratic hand</a> on the church’s wheel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pierbattista Pizzaballa</strong><strong>:</strong> As Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pizzaballa has long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/italian-cardinal-in-jerusalem-new-pope.html">experience in a politically fraught region</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Luis Tagle:</strong> Cardinal Tagle of the Philippines is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/luis-tagle-asian-pope.html">known as the “Asian Francis,”</a> but has been criticized for not being vocal enough about his country’s brutal drug war and clerical sex abuse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jean-Marc Aveline: </strong>Cardinal Aveline of Marseille, France, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/europe/aveline-pope-conclave-contender.html">spent a large part of his career promoting conversations between faiths</a> in a port city at the confluence of diverse cultures and religions that is also plagued by poverty and crime.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robert Francis Prevost:</strong> In the tussle over whether to continue Pope Francis’ inclusive agenda or return to a conservative path, supporters of Cardinal Prevost — a native of Chicago who has spent the bulk of his career outside the U.S. — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/americas/pope-candidate-cardinal-robert-francis-prevost.html">pitch him as a balanced alternative</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Matteo Zuppi: </strong>Cardinal Zuppi of Italy has worked with the needy and the disenfranchised, even as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/matteo-zuppi-pope-bologna.html">participated in peace talks around the world</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mario Grech:</strong> Cardinal Grech comes from Malta, but is known to cardinals around the world for his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/world/europe/pope-candidate-cardinal-grech.html">role as the secretary general of an advisory body of bishops</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Peter</strong> <strong>Erdo:</strong> The archbishop from Hungary is a standard-bearer for those in the church <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/europe/cardinal-erdo-hungary-conservative-pope-candidate.html">who favor a return to traditional rules and doctrine</a> after Francis.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
