An Israeli official familiar with the details said the initial phase of the deal would include a 60-day cease-fire and a flow of aid through U.N.-run operations. Hamas officials stopped short of rejecting the latest proposal but suggested it did not contain strong-enough guarantees on ending the war.</p><p>“Those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a cease-fire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home,” Ms. Leavitt said during a news briefing at the White House.</p><p>A State Department spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, said that while it was not clear if Hamas would support a cease-fire proposal backed by Israel, there was “some important optimism” among officials about a potential deal, adding that the latest proposal held “significant promise.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But it remained to be seen whether the new proposal could resolve the main sticking point between the two sides. Israel is insisting on having the option to resume fighting if Hamas does not surrender and disarm. Hamas is demanding firm guarantees that a temporary cease-fire would lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>After 18 months of war, any pause in the fighting would come as the international community, including allies of Israel, has grown increasingly impatient with efforts to wind down the military assault in Gaza. Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and France have in recent weeks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/israel-allies-denounce-gaza-offensive.html" title="">criticized both Israel’s decision</a> to expand military operations in Gaza and the civilian death toll in the strip.</p><p>“I have some very good feelings about getting to a long-term resolution, temporary cease-fire,” Mr. Witkoff told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday.</p><p>Even Mr. Trump, who presented a united front with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he came into office, appeared to pressure Israel to make an effort to bring the war to an end over the weekend.</p><p>“We’ve been talking to them, and we want to see if we can stop that whole situation as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Both Israel and Hamas had previously said they would accept some of the terms of the new proposal, including the release of 10 living hostages held by Hamas and the remains of others who died in captivity, in exchange for a number of Palestinians in Israeli custody.</p><p>Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-hamas.html" title="">ended a previous cease-fire in March</a> and has since embarked on a new phase of fighting, expanding its control over larger sections of the territory.</p><p>The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed about 1,200 people while 250 others were taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli campaign in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 people, according to Gazan health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>In January, Israel and Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/17/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire" title="">agreed to a multiphase cease-fire deal</a> that would have ultimately ended the war and freed the remaining hostages. Israel ended the truce in mid-March, citing an impasse over details about the next phase of the agreement.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent for The Times, covering President Trump and his administration.</p></div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Tensions in the Middle East</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Tensions Over Iran</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wary of a diplomatic solution to curbing Iran’s nuclear program, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-israel.html">continues to press for military action</a> that would upend President Trump’s push for a negotiated deal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli Forces Kill Palestinian American Teen</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The death of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/middleeast/west-bank-israel-military-killing.html">Amer Rabee, a 14-year-old in the Israeli-occupied West Bank,</a> has spurred anger over Israeli soldiers’ use of force and an apparent lack of accountability.</p></li><li><p><strong> </strong><strong>How Rafah Is Being Razed</strong><strong>:</strong> The southern Gaza city was a sanctuary for Palestinians fleeing Israel’s bombardment. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/15/world/middleeast/rafah-gaza-israel-damage.html">It is now being flattened</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli Airstrike Kills Doctor’s Children</strong><strong>:</strong> At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-doctor-children.html">seven of a pediatric physician’s children were killed</a> in a strike in Khan Younis, according to Gaza health officials and the family.</p></li><li><p><strong> Warning Shots:</strong> Israeli soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/world/middleeast/israel-warning-shots-west-bank.html">fired warning shots</a> to disperse a group of senior Western diplomats, Palestinian officials and journalists as they toured a Palestinian city in the West Bank, according to statements by the Israeli military and the Palestinian Authority and television footage from the scene.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
