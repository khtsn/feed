But, as I report in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/climate/yes-imitation-meat-is-processed-can-it-also-be-healthy.html" title="">an article published today</a>, the sector is still grappling with a bit of an identity crisis.</p><p>If it’s to grow, the imitation meat industry needs to figure out how to appeal to more customers, said John Baumgartner, a consumer food analyst at Mizuho Americas, a financial services group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Effectively, what is the problem to solve?” Baumgartner wrote in an email. “Is it health concerns? Is it climate concerns? Is it neither?”</p><h3 id="link-53b2ecf6"><span><strong>Countering the narrative</strong></span></h3><p>Research has shown that swapping in plant-based meats for conventional meat can reduce cardiovascular risk factors, and that those benefits can outweigh the fact that the products are processed.
