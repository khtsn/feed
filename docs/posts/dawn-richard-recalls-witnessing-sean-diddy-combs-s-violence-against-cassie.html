She testified that Mr. Combs warned her to stay out of his relationship, convincing her to back off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Combs, who wore a khaki sweater to court on Monday, shook his head at times during Ms. Richard’s testimony, passing notes to his lawyers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Under cross-examination, Nicole Westmoreland, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, scrutinized Ms. Richard’s allegations, focusing on the skillet incident. She repeatedly questioned Ms. Richard about how the details of her account had changed over time — from when her lawyer sent a legal demand letter, to a series of interviews with the government, to her testimony on the stand.</p><p>Ms. Richard testified that she had been recounting details “as best as I can recall.” Out of the presence of the jury on Friday, when prosecutors began their questioning of Ms. Richard, a lawyer for Mr. Combs called the allegation a “drop-dead lie.”</p><p>Instances of violence against Ms. Ventura are central to the prosecution’s contention that she was a victim of sex trafficking during much of her 11-year on-and-off relationship with Mr. Combs. To convict Mr. Combs of sex trafficking Ms. Ventura, the government has to show that he forced or coerced her into sex acts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Combs has acknowledged physically abusing Ms. Ventura, but he denies sex trafficking her. His lawyers have denied allegations of a criminal conspiracy that are at the center of the government’s case and have argued that Mr. Combs engaged in perhaps unconventional, but not illegal, sex to which they say Ms. Ventura fully consented. Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Richard, who first joined the Combs-backed girl group Danity Kane through his MTV reality show “Making the Band,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/arts/music/dawn-richard-danity-kane-lawsuit-sean-combs-diddy.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> against Mr. Combs last year, shortly before he was arrested. She accused him of threatening her, groping her and flying into “frenzied, unpredictable rages” while he oversaw her career.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Combs described the lawsuit as a “series of false claims” to elicit a “payday.”</p><p>While questioning Ms. Richard about what she saw of Mr. Combs’s drug use, Ms. Westmoreland focused on another inconsistency in her account. Ms. Richard testified that she had seen Mr. Combs use cocaine, but had told prosecutors in an interview that she had not.</p><p>“You would agree with me that as time progresses your story changes,” Ms. Westmoreland asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Ms. Richard replied.</p><p>Ms. Richard is the first of a series of government witnesses expected to testify about what they saw of Ms. Ventura’s relationship with Mr. Combs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial-cassie" title="">Last week</a>, Ms. Ventura testified that physical abuse plagued their relationship and pushed her into reluctantly engaging in drug-fueled sex marathons with male prostitutes, known as “freak-offs.”</p><p>The next witness on Monday, Kerry Morgan, testified that she was a close friend of Ms. Ventura’s for 17 years but no longer speaks with her. She said she did not want to testify but had appeared in response to a subpoena.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kerry Morgan, one of Casandra Ventura’s former friends, arriving to testify in Mr. Combs’s federal trial.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ted Shaffrey/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Morgan recalled witnessing several instances of abuse, including a trip to Jamaica in which she said she saw Mr. Combs drag Ms. Ventura by her hair and then push her to the ground. She said Ms. Ventura hit her head on a brick surface and didn’t move for about 20 or 30 seconds.</p><p>“I thought she was knocked out,” Ms. Morgan said, testifying that she and Ms. Ventura later hid from Mr. Combs in a ditch.</p><p>Ms. Morgan also recounted Mr. Combs visiting Ms. Ventura’s apartment in early March 2016, not long after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-cassie-assault-video.html" title="">he assaulted her at a hotel in Los Angeles.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Ms. Morgan testified that Mr. Combs yelled and tried to get into the home by hitting the door with a hammer. Sitting on the couch, Ms. Ventura appeared “numb” to the racket, Ms. Morgan testified. “I don’t think she cared if he came in and killed her,” she said.</p><p>The police arrived at the apartment a few hours later, Ms. Morgan testified, though she said she did not know who had called them. Ms. Ventura testified that she had declined to tell the officers who had injured her.</p><p>The friendship between the women ended after what they both described as an incident in which Mr. Combs attacked Ms. Morgan in 2018 at Ms. Ventura’s home. She said he grabbed her neck, leaving finger marks, and hit her on the head with a wooden hanger.</p><p>Afterward, Ms. Morgan testified, she accepted an offer from Ms. Ventura to sign a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for $30,000.</p><p>Near the end of the day, prosecutors began questioning their seventh witness, David James, who was a personal assistant to Mr. Combs for two years.</p><p>Other government witnesses scheduled for this week include Regina Ventura, Ms. Ventura’s mother; Jourdan Atkinson, a former personal chef for Mr. Combs who accused him of shoving her to the ground; and Sharay Hayes, who has described himself as an exotic dancer known as “Punisher.” (Ms. Ventura testified that a man known as Punisher participated in several freak-offs with her and Mr. Combs.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>During Ms. Ventura’s testimony, the defense sought to undermine her account of being a woman coerced into sexual encounters and desperate to escape abuse. One of Mr. Combs’s lawyers seized on an inconsistency in the timing of a rape allegation, suggested that Ms. Ventura consented to freak-offs, and posited that drugs and jealousy over mutual infidelities — not sexual coercion — were the true cause of violence in a troubled and toxic, but still loving, relationship.</p><p>Again and again, Ms. Ventura was asked by the prosecution if she had wanted to participate in freak-offs with escorts. Her answer was always no.</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
