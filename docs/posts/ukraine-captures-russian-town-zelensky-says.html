Military experts had said in recent days that Ukrainian forces had seized most, if not all, of the town. And Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst from the Black Bird Group based in Finland, on Thursday called it “very likely” that it was “now controlled by Ukraine.”</p><p>Ukrainian troops entered Sudzha a few days into the assault and appeared to have slowly cleared the town and its outskirts of any defenders over the past week, according to military analysts.

</div></section></div><div><div><p>Ukraine has targeted Russian airfields in hopes of crippling Moscow’s ability to launch devastating airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and troops. The four airfields targeted by the Ukrainian military on Wednesday housed Su-34 fighter-bombers, which launch powerful glide bombs, and Su-35 fighter jets, which can carry out missile strikes.</p><p>Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the latest attacks were “part of a much longer-running Ukrainian campaign to hold Russian air bases at threat and cause incremental damage to air assets on the ground.”</p><p>Two of the airfields hit in the past week were to the immediate east of Russia’s Kursk region, suggesting that Ukraine may be trying to protect its forces in Russia. The Ukrainian military appears intent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html" title="">on holding on to territory</a> it has captured, and analysts say that fixed Ukrainian positions would be vulnerable to Russian airstrikes.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ukraine said the attacks on Wednesday had been carried out with domestically produced drones. Western allies have placed restrictions on the use of their weapons in Russia amid fears that doing so would escalate the war.</p><p>But Ukraine has continuously appealed for those restrictions to be lifted, saying that missiles would be more effective — a point Mr. Zelensky has raised at least four times in <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-dovodit-sho-dijsno-vmiye-povertati-spravedlivist-zv-92565" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nightly addresses</a> over the last week.</p><p>“Our Ukrainian drones work exactly as they should, but there are things that cannot be done with drones alone,” Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prodovzhuyemo-pracyuvati-z-partnerami-shodo-dalekobijnih-ris-92625" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in his address on Wednesday</a>. “We need other weapons — missile weapons.”</p><p>The United States and Britain, two of Kyiv’s closest allies, have said that Ukraine’s incursion into Russia did not violate their policies. Ukraine has used American vehicles and arms in its assault on Kursk. But it remains unclear what exact terms American or British officials may have set for Kyiv’s use of Western-supplied, long-range weapons inside Russian territory.</p><p>Ukraine’s long-range strike abilities consist of a mix of domestically produced drones that can fly long distances and powerful missiles supplied by partners. Ukraine has used drones to strike in Russia and the missiles to attack military installations in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.</p></div></div><div><div><p>While many of Ukraine’s initial, long-range attacks in Russia were aimed at oil infrastructure and Russian air-defense systems, military airfields appear to be a growing priority.</p><p>Last week, Ukraine struck a Russian airfield <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-lipetsk.html" title="">in the Lipetsk region</a>, which borders Kursk. Satellite imagery reviewed by The Times showed damage to an apparent ammunition depot. Ukraine’s military said warehouses at the Lipetsk airfield contained over 700 glide bombs, a claim that could not be independently confirmed.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed and burned buildings at a military airfield in Lipetsk, Russia, on Aug. 9.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Planet Labs</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Analysts say that Russia will probably be better able to respond to Ukraine’s incursion with air power now that the assault has lost its element of surprise — and since warplanes can target Ukraine’s forces more easily as they dig in to stationary positions.</p><p>Ukrainian troops are already doing so, according to Mr. Zelensky, who said on Thursday that a military command office was being set up in Sudzha.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ukraine’s ability to defend its troops from Russian air attacks may be limited, analysts say. “Enemy aviation, particularly the presence of glide bombs and ballistic missiles, remains a serious threat,” said Serhii Kuzan, the chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group.</p><p>Ukraine recently received its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/world/europe/ukraine-f-16-fighter-jets.html" title="">first batch of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets</a>, which are capable of shooting down Russian missiles and engaging in air combat.</p><p>But whether F-16s could be used to provide air support for Ukraine’s offensive remains to be seen. Russia’s border area is heavily protected by air-defense systems, according to Nico Lange, a German military expert. That, he said, makes it “really difficult to fly close if you’re the Ukrainian Air Force.”</p><p>Malachy Browne<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christoph Koettl<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><p><strong>News and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p>Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion-troops.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">begun withdrawing some troops from Ukraine</a> in an effort to repel Kyiv’s cross-border assault, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.</p></li><li><p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/europe/russia-ukraine-incursion-war-east.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">lashed out at the West</a> over Ukraine’s incursion into Russian territory, a sign of how the surprise attack has unsettled the Kremlin.</p></li><li><p>Ukraine’s attack signified a shift in tactics for Kyiv after more than two years of war with Russia. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s what to know about the operation</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Summer Camps During War: </strong>As the once carefree summers of Ukrainian childhood and young adulthood are forever altered by war, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/world/europe/ukraine-summer-camps-war.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-russia-ukraine&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">traditional camps have taken on a more patriotic tone</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s </strong><strong>Sports in Tatters</strong><strong>: </strong>Facilities have been battered.
