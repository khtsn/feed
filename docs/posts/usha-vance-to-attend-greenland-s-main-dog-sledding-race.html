The annual event is a roughly 26-mile race across ice and snow that brings the toughest mushers — also known as dog sled drivers — and the hardiest dogs together on some of the most punishing terrain imaginable.</p><p>Dog sledders spend years raising and training their huskies for a competition that Greenlanders cherish as a high point of their Arctic culture. Organizers call it “a challenging event that highlights the bond between humans and their dogs.”</p><p>The 2025 edition takes place on Sunday in Sisimiut, on the west coast of Greenland.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mushers celebrating after completing a dog sledding race in Ilulissat.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Greenland is home to the Arctic’s largest remaining sled dog population and has a long tradition of dog sled culture.
