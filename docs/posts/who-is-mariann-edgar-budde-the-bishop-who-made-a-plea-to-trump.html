And as you told the nation yesterday, you have felt the providential hand of a loving God. In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now. There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives. And the people, the people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, who labor in poultry farms and meatpacking plants, who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals, they — they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away, and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here, Mr. President.” Reporter: “Mr. President, what did you think of the sermon?” “I didn’t think it was a good service, no. Thank you very much.” “Thank you — press, thank you.” “They can do much better.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/21/multimedia/21dc-trump-02-fhjz/21dc-trump-02-fhjz-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde addressed President Trump during an inaugural prayer service, and asked him to show mercy to immigrants and the L.G.B.T.Q. community.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a phone interview, Bishop Budde declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s reaction to the service.</p><p>She said that she “wasn’t necessarily calling the president out,” but that she had decided to make her plea “because of the fear” she had seen in Washington’s immigrant and L.G.B.T.Q. communities.</p><p>She wanted Mr. Trump to “be mindful of the people who are scared,” she said.</p><p>“I was trying to say: The country has been entrusted to you,” she added. “And one of the qualities of a leader is mercy.”</p><p>But she also hoped her remarks would echo far beyond Mr. Trump’s ears, she said.</p><p>A little more than half of the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/politics/trump-policies-immigration-tariffs-economy.html" title="">now expresses some support</a> for deporting every unauthorized immigrant living in the United States, according <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to a recent poll</a> from The New York Times and Ipsos.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And Bishop Budde said she felt there had been a shift in the “license” Americans felt to be “really quite cruel.”</p><p>“I wanted to remind all of us that these are our neighbors,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elizabeth Dias is The Times’s national religion correspondent, covering faith, politics and values.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/elizabeth-dias">More about Elizabeth Dias</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
