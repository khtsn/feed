Winter is adding to the misery. A doctor at a hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, said that four infants in tent encampments had died from the cold in the past week.</p><p>Israel says that its target is Hamas and that it does everything possible to limit the loss of civilian life. But the increasingly dire humanitarian situation has prompted a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/israel-amnesty-international-genocide-gaza.html" title="">particularly scathing</a> chorus of condemnation from the United Nations and international human rights organizations.</p><p>Here is a closer look at three parts of Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.</p><h2 id="link-1ae84">Food</h2><p>Yaser Shaban, a 58-year-old civil servant for the Palestinian Authority who is living with six people in a tent in Gaza City, is dependent on the limited supplies of food — beans, lentils and pasta — brought in by humanitarian organizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinian women and girls struggle to reach for food at a distribution center in Khan Younis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>When those run out he begs for food or uses his few remaining shekels to buy items from the market at vastly inflated prices. Fruit and meat are out of reach, he said.

On Dec. 24, it said deliveries of humanitarian aid were still inadequate, particularly in the north, where Israel has ordered evacuations and severely restricted access. Israel is pressing a renewed offensive there in an effort to stamp out what it has called a Hamas resurgence, unleashing some of its military’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/northern-gaza-evacuation-risks.html" title="">most</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/gaza-jabaliya-israel.html" title="">devastating</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-beit-lahia.html" title="">attacks</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/middleeast/israel-strike-hospital-jabaliya.html" title="">yet</a>.</p><p>Georgios Petropoulos, a senior U.N. official based in the southern city of Rafah, noted that even when Israeli authorities allow shipments of humanitarian aid in, they sometimes strip the deliveries of vital components, such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/palestine-gazans-hamas-food.html" title="">fuel needed to run generators</a> in hospitals and shelters. Israel says that the fuel cannot be sent to areas where militants are active.</p><p>“From where we are in Gaza, it looks like the aid system has been weaponized,” Mr. Petropoulos said. “Every day as an aid worker in Gaza, you’re forced to make horrible decisions: Should I let people die of starvation or the cold?”</p><p>On Dec. 5, Amnesty International accused Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">citing</a> prevalent hunger, the risk of famine and the inaccessibility of aid as contributing factors. Israel rejected the claim, and the Israeli authority that coordinates the flow of goods to Gaza <a href="https://x.com/cogatonline/status/1871173503438737749" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on social media that the group’s accusation that it is obstructing aid deliveries and precipitating famine “deliberately and inaccurately ignores the extensive humanitarian efforts made by Israel,” and listed recent deliveries of food, fuel and medical supplies.</p><p>There is little question that aid delivery has been reduced to a trickle, both because of Israeli restrictions and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/middleeast/gaza-looting.html" title="">concerns about looting</a>. To Ms. Nassar, what matters is that she still does not have enough to eat. She said that there is food in the market — most often smuggled in, or looted from humanitarian aid convoys — so, to outsiders, “it may not look like famine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“But when food is so expensive that most people cannot afford it, is it still available?” she asked. </p><h2 id="link-2dd820">Water</h2><p>Mr. Lulu, the former coffee seller, has no regular access to a tap for water. He lives in a tent camp in Rafah, in southern Gaza, and the water there is delivered by the tank-load to a central area, where residents wait in line for hours to fill up their jars and buckets, at 2 shekels, or 50 cents, a gallon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinian children collect water in jerrycans at a camp for displaced people in Deir al Balah in the Gaza Strip.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But the quality is dubious: smelly, cloudy and flecked with debris. “The only good thing about it,” he said, “is that it is less bad than the seawater.” He knows that drinking the water will exacerbate his kidney problems, but bottled water is unaffordable.</p><p>It wasn’t always that way. Gaza has water treatment plants, desalinization facilities and three pipelines channeling fresh water from Israel. But in a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/19/extermination-and-acts-genocide/israel-deliberately-depriving-palestinians-gaza" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> released on Dec. 19, Human Rights Watch said Israel was intentionally depriving Palestinians in Gaza of adequate access to safe water for drinking and sanitation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The pipelines were turned off and damaged from bombing at the start of the war and only partially reopened a month later, the report found. Israel’s restrictions on fuel imports have virtually halted desalinization activities. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/24/world/middleeast/gaza-sanitation-crisis.html" title="">Water and sanitation infrastructure</a> has sustained extensive damage, the report found. Israel also prevented the importation of equipment and chemicals, such as chlorine,<span>  </span>needed for purifying water, saying those items risked being used by Hamas.</p><p>As a result, Gazans have little access to clean water. The report recorded 669,000 recorded cases of acute watery diarrhea since the war began, and more than 132,000 cases of jaundice, a sign of hepatitis. Both diseases spread via contaminated water.</p><p>The Israeli Ministry of Defense said in response to the report that Israeli pipelines were sending millions of gallons of water into the Gaza Strip and that Israel had helped repair damage to the water infrastructure caused by Hamas. Human Rights Watch noted that water from the pipelines was insufficient to offset the decrease in water production from other sources.</p><p>Ms. Moen says she<span>  </span>spends two hours a day waiting in line to buy drinking water — at 19 shekels a gallon, or more than $5, in north Gaza. And she still has to boil and filter it. “At least I don’t see worms in it,” she said. “That is our criteria now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-708fc4b9">Medicine</h2><p>When Ms. Moen’s house in Beit Lahia was hit in October, most of her immediate family died.

Going to a hospital is out of the question, she said. They are unclean, reek of death and blood, and lack the most basic supplies. </p><p>Few are functioning properly. The Israeli military forced patients and staff members on Friday to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hospital-raid.html" title="">leave one of the last functioning hospitals</a> in northern Gaza, saying it was a stronghold for Hamas.

Nor does she think it will make a difference.</p><p>“It’s been over a year of mass killing, starvation, displacement, and misery, and no one seems to care,” she said. </p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
