It comes before he is set to travel there on Sunday to visit communities damaged by the hurricane and speak to emergency medical workers and residents trying to pick up the pieces. It will be his second such visit to the state this month.</p><p>The White House typically approves <a href="https://www.fema.gov/pdf/media/factsheets/dad_disaster_declaration.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disaster declarations for states</a> after major natural disasters. The president makes the declaration after a state’s governor — in this case, Gov. Ron DeSantis — makes a request for the federal assistance.</p><p>Mr. Biden finalized the declaration on Friday, freeing up federal funding for 34 counties, as well as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. The move also provides grants for temporary housing and home repairs, loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help residents and businesses, according to the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I want everyone in the impacted areas to know we’re going to do everything we can to help you pick back up the pieces and get back to where you were,” Mr. Biden said during a hurricane briefing with top cabinet officials at the White House on Friday.</p><p>Total economic losses from Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene, which struck several states in the Southeast last month, could soar to over $200 billion, according to early estimates. Mr. Biden has said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough resources to respond to the immediate needs of communities in the wake of both storms. But he has warned that Congress will need to pass more funding for longer-term recovery.</p><p>“We’re going to be going to Congress,” Mr. Biden said. “We’re going to need a lot of help. We’re going to need a lot more money as we identify specifically how much is needed.”</p><p>FEMA has approved $441 million in assistance for survivors of Hurricane Helene and over $349 million in public assistance funding to help rebuild communities, according to a statement from the agency.</p><p>The visit to Florida on Sunday also comes amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/biden-trump-hurricane-misinformation.html" title="">rising frustration in the White House</a> with the flood of misinformation about the federal response to recent natural disasters, led by former President Donald J.
