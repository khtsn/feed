All the folks are optimistic,” he added, referring to his medical team. He said that one of the surgeons treating him was given the same diagnosis 32 years ago.</p><p>Mr. Biden spoke to reporters after an <a href="https://www.drba.net/events/memorial-day-service-0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event honoring veterans</a> in New Castle, Del., making his first public remarks since May 18, when his office <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/politics/biden-prostate-cancer.html" title="">announced his illness</a> and said the cancer had metastasized to the bone. Mr. Biden attended the event, which fell on the 10th anniversary of the death of his son Beau, with Beau’s son, Robert Biden II, who graduated from high school this week.</p><p>Mr. Biden said that his treatment was “all a matter of taking a pill, one particular pill.”</p><p>“The expectation is we’re going to be able to beat this,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Biden’s cancer was given a Gleason score of 9.

He responded to a question about Democrats who hold that he should not have by saying: “Why didn’t anyone run against me then?”</p><p>“We have a lot going on, and I think we’re in a really difficult moment, not only in America, but in the world,” Mr. Biden quickly added. “I think that this is one of those inflection points in history.”</p><p>He said that he was “very proud” of his time in office. “I put my record as president against any president at all,” he said. He added that leading presidential historians ranked his term highly, and that President Trump was rated last.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan, a New York-based reporter for The Times, covers breaking news and other topics.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
