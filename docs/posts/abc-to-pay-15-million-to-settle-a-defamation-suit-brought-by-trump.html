Trump’s future presidential foundation and museum to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump this spring concerning on-air statements made by the network’s star anchor George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>Under the terms of a settlement agreement filed in Federal District Court in Miami, ABC News and Mr. Stephanopoulos said they would soon publish a statement saying they “regret” the remarks that the anchor made about Mr. Trump during a televised interview in March.</p><p>ABC News, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, will pay Mr. Trump an additional $1 million for his legal fees.</p><p>The outcome of the lawsuit marks an unusual victory for Mr. Trump in his ongoing legal campaign against national news organizations. Several of his previous attempts to sue media outlets for defamation, including lawsuits against CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, ended in defeat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,” a spokeswoman for ABC News said on Saturday.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s lawyers and a spokesman for his transition did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</p><p>During the interview that prompted the lawsuit, Mr. Stephanopoulos asked Representative Nancy Mace, Republican of South Carolina, who has spoken publicly about being raped as a teenager, why she had continued to support Mr. Trump after he was found liable for rape in a civil case in Manhattan last year.</p><p>In that case, a federal jury found Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/09/nyregion/trump-liable-verdict-form-jury.html" title="">liable for sexually abusing</a> and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll, but it did not find him liable for rape. Still, the judge who oversaw the proceeding <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590045/gov.uscourts.nysd.590045.212.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later clarified</a> that because of New York’s narrow legal definition of rape, the jury’s verdict did not mean that Ms. Carroll had “failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’”</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/trump-lawsuit-abc-stephanopoulos.html" title="">ultimately sued ABC</a>, accusing Mr. Stephanopoulos of harming his reputation by saying multiple times on-air that he had been found liable for raping Ms. Carroll.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The settlement announced on Saturday required ABC to place an editor’s note at the bottom of an online article about the interview with Ms. Mace. The note was to read: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC’s This Week on March 10, 2024.”</p><p>The agreement was made public one day after a federal magistrate judge working on the defamation case ordered Mr. Trump to sit for a deposition next week in Florida. Mr. Stephanopoulos was also scheduled to sit for a deposition next week.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
