Trump’s future presidential foundation and museum to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump concerning on-air statements made by the network’s star anchor George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>The network and Mr. Stephanopoulos also published a statement saying they “regret” remarks made about Mr. Trump during a televised interview in March.</p><p>ABC News, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, will pay Mr. Trump an additional $1 million for his legal fees, under the terms of a settlement agreement filed in Federal District Court in Miami.</p><p>The outcome marks an unusual victory for Mr. Trump in his ongoing legal campaign against national news organizations. Several of his previous attempts to sue media outlets for defamation, including lawsuits against CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, ended in defeat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is extremely difficult for public figures like Mr. Trump to win a defamation lawsuit against a media outlet, given the high legal threshold needed to prove not only that the outlet lied, but also that it did so with malicious intent.</p><p>The settlement agreement was signed on the same day that a federal magistrate judge ordered Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/us/politics/trump-deposition-abc-stephanopoulos.html" title="">to sit for a deposition</a> in the case next week in Florida. Mr. Stephanopoulos was also on the verge of being deposed.</p><p>“We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,” a spokeswoman for ABC News said on Saturday.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Trump declined to comment on the agreement. A spokesman for his transition did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p><p>In the interview that prompted the lawsuit, Mr. Stephanopoulos asked Representative Nancy Mace, Republican of South Carolina, who has spoken publicly about being raped as a teenager, why she had continued to support Mr. Trump after he was found “liable for rape” in a civil case in Manhattan last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In that case, a federal jury found Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/09/nyregion/trump-liable-verdict-form-jury.html" title="">liable for sexually abusing</a> and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll, but it did not find him liable for rape. Still, the judge who oversaw the proceeding <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590045/gov.uscourts.nysd.590045.212.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later clarified</a> that because of New York’s narrow legal definition of rape, the jury’s verdict did not mean that Ms. Carroll had “failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’”</p><p>Mr. Trump was ordered by a jury in the Carroll case to pay her damages of $83.3 million. He is appealing the verdict.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/trump-lawsuit-abc-stephanopoulos.html" title="">ultimately sued ABC</a> in March, accusing Mr. Stephanopoulos of harming his reputation by saying multiple times on-air that he had been found liable for raping Ms. Carroll.</p><p>With the settlement, Mr. Trump was able to essentially persuade ABC News to relinquish its efforts to defend itself in the case.</p><p>Tensions had run high between ABC News and Mr. Trump’s camp throughout the 2024 campaign.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/us/politics/trump-debate-abc-fox-news.html" title="">denounced ABC</a> as “terrible” for its handling of his sole debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, faulting the moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, for fact-checking his answers and musing about stripping the network of its broadcasting license.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He also grumbled about the close ties between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/abc-debate-dana-walden-kamala-harris.html" title="">Dana Walden</a>, the senior Disney executive whose sprawling portfolio includes ABC News, and Ms. Harris. Ms. Walden is a longtime friend of the vice president who held Harris fund-raisers at her home. ABC News said that Ms. Walden played no role in editorial decisions.</p><p>Under the settlement terms, ABC agreed to place an editor’s note at the bottom of an online article about the interview with Ms. Mace. The note was to read: “ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC’s This Week on March 10, 2024.”</p><p>In May, Mr. Stephanopoulos was asked about Mr. Trump’s pending lawsuit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU5dIKR2fp8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during an appearance</a> on “Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”</p><p>“How does it feel to be sued by a former president for defamation for just doing your job?” Mr. Colbert asked.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it now comes with the territory,” Mr. Stephanopoulos replied. “But I’m not going to be cowed out of doing my job because of the threat of Donald Trump.”</p><p>The audience cheered.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
