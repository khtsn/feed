The film, directed by James Mangold, traces Mr. Dylan’s arrival in New York as a teenager and his ascent through the Greenwich Village music scene.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Chalamet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/arts/timothee-chalamet-bob-dylan-biopic.html" title="">sang live</a> in the movie and said he had spent five years working with a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/timothee-chalamet-worked-harmonica-coach-5-years-bob-dylan-style-complete-unknown-1235826418/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">harmonica coach</a> to nail the singer’s mannerisms. Although his dark hair is tousled to Dylanesque proportions in the film, on Friday, it was blond and straight, sticking out from a turquoise beanie. Mr. Chalamet appeared to be dressed as Mr. Dylan had at a Sundance Film Festival appearance in 2003 for the premiere of the film “Masked and Anonymous,” which the musician starred in and co-wrote.</p><p>“A Complete Unknown,” which will be released in theaters on Dec. 25, is based on the 2015 book “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/books/review-dylan-goes-electric-considers-folk-rock-and-a-60s-divide.html" title="">Dylan Goes Electric!</a>” by Elijah Wald, which recounts the years leading up to Mr. Dylan’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/arts/bob-dylan-s-unswerving-road-back-to-newport.html" title="">polarizing performance</a> with electric instruments at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/COMPLETEUNKNOWNPREMIERE-02-ptmb/COMPLETEUNKNOWNPREMIERE-02-ptmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/COMPLETEUNKNOWNPREMIERE-02-ptmb/COMPLETEUNKNOWNPREMIERE-02-ptmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/13/multimedia/COMPLETEUNKNOWNPREMIERE-02-ptmb/COMPLETEUNKNOWNPREMIERE-02-ptmb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Timothée Chalamet in a light blue beanie a black leather jacket and a grey scarf walks alongside a row of smiiling fans.

The actress Edie Falco sped by wearing denim on denim, and the playwright Jeremy O. Harris chatted in maroon cowboy boots.</p><p>Just before 8 p.m, the cast members and their guests grabbed boxes of popcorn with Mr. Chalamet’s face on them and filed into the theater.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The actresses Monica Barbaro and Elle Fanning.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The actors Charlie Tahan and P.J.
