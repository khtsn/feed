It would be readying plans to build a second plant somewhere out West — Salt Lake City was a contender — generating another 100 jobs.</p><p>Based in Australia, Easy Signs manufactures banners and marketing installations for corporate events, using huge printers to press logos and slogans onto rolls of cloth. Its American business has been growing 70 percent a year. Still, the company is putting off an expansion.</p><p>Its cloth signs are displayed on aluminum stands made in China. Those products are now subject to a series of tariffs reaching as high as 365 percent under a <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/june/ustr-issues-tariffs-chinese-products" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">policy</a> set in motion by former President Donald J. Trump and continued by the Biden administration in the name of protecting American industry from Chinese government subsidies.</p><p>The costs of imported components could increase further should Mr. Trump win November’s presidential election and follow through on his threat to add a tariff of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-imports.html" title="">60 percent</a> or more on all Chinese goods, and 10 percent to all imports.</p></div></div><div><p>“That’s definitely a scary concept,” said Andy Fryer, co-founder of Easy Signs. “The whole feasibility goes out the window.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Allentown, Pa., factory of Easy Signs. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aaron Richter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Easy Signs makes banners and marketing installations, printing slogans and logos.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aaron Richter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>In interviews with two dozen American manufacturers, retailers and shipping agents, many said they were holding off on investments and expansion given the uncertainty over tariffs on imported products and parts — especially on those shipped from China. If Mr. Trump wins the election, the potential for further disruption is great. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins, many of the people said, they expect trade hostilities with China to continue, threatening increased costs for components used by American businesses.</p><p>“Companies have kind of decided that, regardless of what government is coming into power, tariffs on China are going to continue to get higher,” said Mandeep Singh, whose business, Via Indigos in Cincinnati, connects American factories with suppliers in India.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Singh was recently contacted by a company that makes air purifiers and was eager to shift production from China to India. “They want us to take care of the entire product range,” he said. “They would like to find a solution earlier than later.”</p><p>Mr. Trump began imposing broad tariffs on imports from China in 2018. President Biden has extended that policy, adding tariffs to new categories of Chinese goods including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/us/politics/biden-china-tariffs.html" title="">electric vehicles</a> and solar cells.</p><p>Both administrations said the levies were intended to spur the return of factory jobs to the United States. But even as tariffs on Chinese imports have pressured manufacturers and retailers to reduce dependence on China, they have typically caused production to shift to other low-wage countries like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/01/business/mexico-china-us-trade.html" title="">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/29/business/economy/china-us-trade-supply-chain.html" title="">Vietnam</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/business/india-us-manufacturing.html" title="">India</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Business leaders said they expect trade hostilities with China to continue if Vice President Kamala Harris wins in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Some businesses are stockpiling inventory by increasing imports, according to a recent analysis by Project44, a company that provides technology used by businesses to manage their supply chains. In June and July — the peak time for retailers amassing inventory for the holiday season — the volume of ocean shipments reaching the United States from China increased more than 4 percent from the previous year, according to the report.</p></div><div><div><p>Other companies are riding out the current confusion, having grown accustomed to unrelenting chaos in the supply chain. The pandemic upended global manufacturing and shipping, yielding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/business/supply-chain-small-business.html" title="">floating traffic jams off ports</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/business/supply-chain-shortages.html" title="">product shortages</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/business/global-shipping-rates.html" title="">Suez Canal</a> has been rendered nearly off limits by strikes on vessels by Houthi rebels in Yemen acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, sending shipping prices skyward. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html" title="">Panama Canal</a> has limited traffic in the face of a drought. Rail workers in Canada are threatening to strike along with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-retailers-rush-holiday-imports-fearing-strikes-disruptions-2024-08-09/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dockworkers</a> at ports on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Easy Signs’ cloth signs are displayed on aluminum stands made in China. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aaron Richter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some businesses are stockpiling inventory by increasing imports.

He has raised prices to pass on roughly half that cost. His suppliers in China have reduced prices on some items, sharing the burden of the tariffs, he added.</p><p>Mr. Shackleton has considered finding suppliers in other countries but has stuck with China because it presents an unbeatable combination of high quality and low prices, he said.</p><p>“We are busy with a lot of other aspects of running the business,” he said. “Moving around pieces on a board falls down the priority list even if we could argue that it’s existential.”</p><p>Many importers are placing faith in the assumption that Mr. Trump would stop short of imposing 60 percent tariffs because that would sow chaos in the economy, menace the stock market and lift prices to uncomfortable levels.</p><p>“Nobody I see is planning for it,” said Sara Dandan, founder of FourOneOne, a Chicago business that books shipping containers for importers. “It comes down to an American consumer thing. We’re used to being able to go to Walmart and buy a $2 spatula.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>But Mr. Trump has time and again breached traditional norms. Eight years ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/economy/trump-manufacturing-jobs-world-trade-china.html" title="">trade experts scoffed</a> at his vows to add across-the-board tariffs to Chinese imports.</p><p>With such false reassurances as a guide, some companies are concerned enough by the tariff talk to make contingency plans.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J. Trump has threatened to add a tariff of 60 percent or more on all Chinese goods, and 10 percent to all imports.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>“You have to take it seriously,” said Chris Taylor, chief executive of GridStor, a company in Portland, Ore., that develops energy storage projects. “I think you would ignore that at your peril.”</p><p>GridStor has been placing early orders for batteries for a project planned for the Houston area. Mr. Taylor has been urging his suppliers to move faster to set up factory operations in the United States or nearby to limit dependence on Asia. “In every meeting, that conversation comes up,” he said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Larger companies are hanging on to extra inventory of parts and finished goods, accepting higher costs for warehousing and insurance as a hedge against future tariff increases, said Ara Ohanian, chief executive of Netstock, which designs software used by companies to manage their supply chains. Some of his customers have been shifting orders to Mexico to avoid tariffs on Chinese imports.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/business/china-mexico-trade.html" title="">Chinese companies have themselves set up factories in Mexico</a>, using the North American trade agreement to gain duty free access to the United States. Some American importers assume that a second Trump term would halt that arrangement. Auto companies are especially concerned, given that Mexico has become a major supplier of parts for automotive plants in the United States.</p><p>“Everybody is getting skittish,” said Ross George, a supply chain consultant focused on the auto industry. “They say: ‘We know we are buying from a Chinese company, but it says, “Made in Mexico.” It’s not quite as clear cut as we’d like.’”</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Metal frame segments that have been prepared for packing and shipping.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aaron Richter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sample signs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aaron Richter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>The solar industry appears especially vulnerable to an intensifying trade war given its heavy dependence on imported cells from Southeast Asia. Chinese companies have in recent years set up plants in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam to avoid American duties on exports from China. That has prompted fresh tariffs on exports from those countries, a trend expected to broaden if Mr. Trump returns to office.</p></div><div><div><p>Even the expectation of further trade impediments risks slowing the emergence of solar energy, said Mike Hall, the chief executive of Anza, a company that matches buyers and sellers of solar energy gear. “It makes things more expensive and creates uncertainty and fear,” he said.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, Easy Signs recently received two shipping containers full of aluminum stands at the Port of Philadelphia. Rather than pay the extra duties, it declined to accept them, instead paying extra shipping costs to return the cargo back to its warehouse in Australia.</p><p>But the company is consoled by one key area of growth. “We’re going to do a lot of election signs,” said Amanda Strait, the factory’s operations manager.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter S.
