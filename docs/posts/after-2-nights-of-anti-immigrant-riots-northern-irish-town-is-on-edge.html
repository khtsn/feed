In another window, the wiry end of a charred bed frame was just visible, the sign of an attempted arson attack.</p><p>For two nights, this street in Northern Ireland has been the site of rioting, with homes, businesses and vehicles attacked in what the police have described as “hate-fueled acts and mob rule.” Some fear the unrest could restart on Wednesday night.</p><p>The outbreak of violence began after two 14-year-old boys appeared in a local court on Monday charged with attempted oral rape of a girl on Clonavon Terrace on Saturday night. The boys spoke through a Romanian translator, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98p0696r4do" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BBC reported</a>, and both denied the charges through their lawyer.</p><p>The assault set off an outcry in Ballymena, a town of about 31,000 people, and tapped into a broader anti-immigrant movement that has resulted in several outbreaks of violence in recent years. Far-right groups and influencers on social media amplified news of the assault case and celebrated the ensuing riots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Northern Ireland has seen increased immigration in recent years, with the percentage of the population born outside of the United Kingdom rising from 6.5 percent in 2011 to 8.6 percent in 2021, according to the most recent <a href="https://www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/RS158_0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">census data</a>. But the number of immigrants is still <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgm7vn2kegjo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relatively low</a> compared with many other countries in Europe, and emigration is high. Experts <a href="https://www.lawcentreni.org/news/home-a-place-for-everyone/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a> that far-right activists have exploited a housing shortage and an ongoing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-61221378" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost of living crisis</a> to incite violence against asylum seekers and other migrants.</p><p>Police officers came under “sustained attack” on Tuesday night, with Molotov cocktails, bricks and fireworks, <a href="https://www.psni.police.uk/latest-news/police-service-statement-second-night-violence-ballymena" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> a statement from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and 17 officers were injured.</p><p>A heavily pregnant woman was evacuated from one house that was set on fire, a local politician, Sian Mulholland, told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002dbvy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the BBC show “Good Morning Ulster,”</a> adding that the violence had been live-streamed on social media and that rioters had been directed on “how to get around the police barricades.”</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, Clonavon Terrace and the surrounding streets were quiet as residents huddled in doorways. Signs and flags had appeared on some homes in the area, stating the nationality of those inside. “British household,” read one handwritten sign above a smashed window. Union Jack and red and white Ulster flags hung against windows. On some doorways, signs with a Filipino flag notified onlookers: “Filipino lives here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Michelle O’Neill, the first minister of Northern Ireland, said in a <a href="https://x.com/moneillsf/status/1932735595475882157" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Wednesday that the “racist and sectarian attacks on families” were “abhorrent and must stop immediately.” She added: “No one, now or ever, should feel the need to place a sticker on their door to identify their ethnicity just to avoid being targeted.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A line of police in riot gear standing in front of police vans, with a fire visible in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk/11int-nireland-riot-02-mpzk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/fb82b99e-d417-5a5f-8ab8-4a7d4544c678" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers lined up in front of a burning vehicle during a second night of riots in Ballymena.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The police used a water cannon against crowds and fired plastic baton rounds in Ballymena, while unrest also took place in parts of Belfast and in the town of Carrickfergus.

The report’s author concluded that a “disturbing pattern of locally driven racist and anti-immigrant activity in Northern Ireland” was being escalated by international extremists who were amplifying “fabricated narratives” on social media.</p><p>Dessie Donnelly, the author of the report, told The New York Times that some previous incidents had been set off by criminal encounters involving migrants, while others “had all the hallmarks of made-up stories.”</p><p>“There is a deliberate strategy to build a narrative of incidents being perpetrated by the ‘other’ — the immigrant communities — against ‘our’ communities,” he said. “Suddenly a lot of the crime, like sexual offenses, attempted abductions of children, are all laid at the doorstep of this immigrant ‘other’ living in our community. Whether these incidents are true or false doesn’t really seem to matter online.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Donnelly, who works for a Belfast-based technology research group, The Rabble Coop, said that police and government statistics showed that the “vast majority” of sex crimes in Northern Ireland were carried out by white men from the country, but that extremist messaging presenting migrants as a threat was “finding fertile ground.”</p><p>According to the most recent Northern Ireland census, 16 percent of Ballymena residents recorded a national identity outside British, Irish and Northern Irish groups in 2021, up from 10 percent at the previous census in 2011.</p><p>The largest nationality in the “other” group was Romanian in the most recent census, followed by Polish, Bulgarian and Slovakian.</p><p>Five people were arrested on suspicion of rioting in Ballymena on Tuesday night, while another suspect was arrested on suspicion of disorder in Newtownabbey.</p><p>The police are also investigating a Molotov cocktail attack in the village of Cullybackey, around three miles away from Ballymena, that took place shortly after midnight on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>A vehicle was set on fire and a nearby property, with a woman and two children inside, was damaged, in what investigators are treating as a racially motivated hate crime.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ali Watkins covers international news for The Times and is based in London.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
