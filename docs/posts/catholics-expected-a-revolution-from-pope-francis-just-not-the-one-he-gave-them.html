Many of his supporters, who expected him to be a pope of radical change, felt let down.</p><p>It was a salient example of how Francis, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-dead.html" title="">died on Monday at 88</a>, was a pope of great, often outsized, expectations. His revolutionary and freewheeling style led Catholics across the spectrum to invest him with their most ambitious — at times unrealistic — hopes and fears, sometimes independent of what he said or did.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Some liberal Catholics, forgetting Francis was the leader of a deeply conservative institution, expected him to make women priests, change teaching on birth control or throw his weight behind same sex unions and gay marriage. Some conservatives, including a few who convinced themselves that the Argentine pope was a secret Communist, worried he would torch the church doctrine, even though he never touched it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican on Easter Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yara Nardi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Transparency advocates appreciated the increased clarity he brought to the Vatican Bank, but wanted more financial reforms. Advocates for victims of clerical sex abuse appreciated new protection measures, but wanted universal zero tolerance measures.</p><p>“If you are a left-wing Catholic you may think the pope talked a great game but didn’t deliver as much change as you would like,” said John L. Allen Jr., a longtime Vatican analyst and the editor of Crux, a publication specializing in the Catholic Church. “For every one of those, there’s a conservative Catholic that thinks the pope went way too far.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Now, as cardinals descend on Rome to discuss the church’s challenges, they will soon choose from their ranks a successor to Francis who will carry a whole new array of expectations — about whether he will breathe life into a certain region of the globe, work to reform or restore, follow through on Francis’ promised upheavals or roll them back.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There’s a lot of unfinished business that whoever comes next is going to have to pick up,” Mr. Allen said.</p><p>But Francis’ supporters, detractors and Vatican analysts agree that there was also a lot that Francis did do.</p><p>“He has fundamentally changed the culture of the church. Without really touching any doctrine,” said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a prominent Vatican analyst who in 2005 was forced out by the future Benedict XVI as editor of a Catholic magazine because he had published articles critical of church positions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Married and same-sex couples taking part in a public blessing ceremony in front of the Cologne Cathedral in Cologne, Germany, in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Martin Meissner/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Francis, he said, allowed an “openness for discussion and debate that freed theologians to once again talk and write about things, because he believed that this is the way theology grows, to figure out how to preach the gospel in the 21st century without just repeating 13th century formulas that nobody understands. So these are revolutionary changes.”</p><p>But there were concrete changes, too. Francis cracked the door open for divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion by giving more latitude to local priests and bishops. But instead of changing church law, he encouraged people to engage in the process of praying over the issue with their priests.</p><p>He opened up major meetings of bishops — his preferred decision-making body — to laypeople and women, and he put women in big jobs within the powerful Roman bureaucracy that governed the church.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-12"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He suppressed the Latin Mass beloved by traditionalists who wanted to restore old ways, made liturgical changes intended to make the church’s prayers more accessible to people in local languages, and allowed priests to bless same-sex couples. But he also allowed African priests who revolted against the blessings to essentially ignore the rule.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The cardinals who elected Francis in 2013 did so with a clear desire that he reform the Curia, and he introduced a new Vatican Constitution, streamlined its departments to avoid repetition and waste and introduced cultural changes.</p><p>“Everyone was forced to really look outside, to have a dialogue and language suited for the outside world, this was the change,” said Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, who used to run the Vatican’s culture department.</p><p>Some Vatican officials said significant resistance slowed Francis, and that changes he made were more incremental than revolutionary. But Cardinal Ravasi believed the changes to the Curia were permanent, and “not just cosmetic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis in Juba, South Sudan in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Supporters of Francis in the church hierarchy and veteran Vatican analysts say Francis’ effect on the church was more complicated, and in some ways deeper, than policy changes or specific reforms. He sought to change the way the church saw itself, incessantly haranguing his hierarchy against acting like princes above their flock.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“Change of process is more important than the change of product. It’s deeper. It’s more important. It’s more long lasting,” Cardinal Michael Czerny, who was a close aide to Francis, said of the meetings. “The topics are secondary.”</p><p>But he said that the more collegial, bottom-up process would ultimately be better to take on difficult topics, and make progressive decisions with sticking power. Concerns about the process being rolled back were misplaced, he said, because a new pope could decide to do anything.</p><p>“There is nothing that we have done over 2,000 years that couldn’t be rolled back,” he said, but undoing such a deep change in process would be a radical, and difficult, reversal.</p><p>On the world stage, Francis’ changes may be equally lasting. He sought to bring the church out into the world. He appointed cardinals all around the globe, often passing over traditional centers of Catholicism for far-flung places to increase the church’s global footprint.</p><p>After Benedict had inadvertently damaged relations with the Muslim world by delivering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/world/europe/15papalcnd.html" title="">a speech that insulted Islam</a> early in his pontificate, Francis set about improving the relationship, often in lands where Catholics lived in danger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He flew to Iraq during the pandemic to meet with a Shiite leader, <a href="http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Shiite-leader:-the-meeting-between-the-pope-and-al-Sistani-historic-moment,-a-message-of-tolerance-52195.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani</a>, in the holy city of Najaf. He signed major agreements with Muslim spiritual leaders designed to recognize one another’s rights and protect vulnerable Catholic minorities. He undertook enormous criticism from conservatives who accused him of caving on human rights by trying to improve relations with a Communist regime that persecuted Catholics in China.</p><p>“He has pushed the boundaries,” said Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican’s foreign minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph released by the Vatican media office showing Pope Francis meeting a top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, in the Iraqi city of Najaf, in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vatican Media</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But perhaps his most consequential change for the church will be seen in coming weeks.</p><p>Francis appointed a large majority of the College of Cardinals that will now pick his successor. He often chose prelates who shared his priorities of being close to the poor, welcoming the marginalized and moving issues like climate change to the forefront.</p><p>For many, the question now is whether those cardinals will pick someone who will meet or dash the expectations of Catholics who supported Francis. But those who knew Francis best say that unrealistic expectations made for a reductive metric by which to judge his legacy.</p><p>“In many ways,” Archbishop Gallagher said, Francis was “an old-fashioned conservative Jesuit. At the same time, somebody who’s very open to what certain other voices are saying in the church.”</p><p>Bringing those two things together, he said, was the story of his pontificate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nuns waiting for a prayer in honor of Pope Francis at the Basilica of St. Mary Major, a church in Rome that Pope Francis chose as his burial place, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gianni Cipriano for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Emma Bubola<!-- --> contributed reporting from Rome</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jason Horowitz is the Rome bureau chief for The Times, covering Italy, the Vatican, Greece and other parts of Southern Europe.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>A Revolutionary Pope, Just Not as All Expected<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/roman-catholic-church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/vatican-bank">Vatican Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pope-benedict-xvi">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/23/world/europe/pope-francis-catholic-church-legacy.html">203</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/23/world/europe/pope-francis-catholic-church-legacy.html">203</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Pope Francis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Church of the Poor:</strong> Around St. Peter’s Square, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/francis-poor.html">the pope offered services to the homeless and migrants</a>, in ways that often did not go down well with his fellow clerics.</p></li><li><p><strong> Helping Close the Casket:</strong> Cardinal Roger Mahony, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/cardinal-roger-mahony-pope-francis-funeral.html">accused of covering up cases of abuse</a> as archbishop of Los Angeles, will have an official role in the ceremonies around Francis’ funeral.</p></li><li><p><strong>Whither Progressive Christians After Pope Francis?:</strong> Millions of progressive Christians in the United States, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, considered Francis to be a powerful counterweight to a rising conservative Christian power.
