    <h1>Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, Confirms She Is in Remission from Cancer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Catherine, Princess of Wales, said on Tuesday that her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/world/europe/kate-middleton-cancer-free-chemotherapy.html" title="">cancer</a> was in remission, lifting a major cloud from the British royal family, which had struggled with serious health concerns for both her and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/world/europe/king-charles-cancer.html" title="">King Charles III</a>.</p><p>“It is a relief to now be in remission and I remain focused on recovery,” Catherine, the wife of Prince William, wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DE0BZyJN1kt/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Instagram</a>.</p><p>“As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal. I am however looking forward to a fulfilling year ahead,” she added. “There is much to look forward to.”</p><p>Catherine said last September that she had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/world/europe/kate-middleton-cancer-free-chemotherapy.html" title="">completed chemotherapy</a> for her cancer and her goal was to remain cancer free. But Kensington Palace, where she and William have their offices, declined to say at that point whether her doctors had declared her medically free of cancer, or whether she was undergoing any other treatment.</p></div></div>
