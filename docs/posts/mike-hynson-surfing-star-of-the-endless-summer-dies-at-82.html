He was 82.</p><p>His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Donna Klaasen Jost, who collaborated with Hynson on his 2009 autobiography, “Transcendental Memories of a Surf Rebel.” She said the cause was not yet known.</p><p>Hynson arose in an era when surfing was often marginalized as a curious ritual of West Coast teenage culture, thanks to frothy matinee fare like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbFUyhFG2vY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Beach Blanket Bingo”</a> (1965) and a swell of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsDKMkPCOeA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beach Boys hits</a>.
