The influential young conservative Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Now, Kirk is well known for his conservative political organization Turning Point USA and his podcast, “The Charlie Kirk Show.” President Trump has said of Kirk, “No one understood or had the heart of the youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>So I want us to talk today about not just Kirk, but also the rising political violence in the country. And to note: We are taping on Thursday, so events will almost certainly have changed by the time everybody hears us. So first off, Jamelle, what did you wake up thinking this morning?</p><p><strong>Jamelle Bouie:</strong> I’ve had two thoughts, two main ones. One regarding Kirk and one regarding political violence. The one regarding Kirk is that it’s quite easy to condemn the circumstances of his death. I don’t think anyone thinks anyone should be shot and killed and we don’t really have a motive or anything. So I hesitate to say Kirk was shot and killed for his speech; we don’t really know. But a political figure being killed is a terrible tragedy.</p><p>I also think that some of the remembrance of Kirk is edging in the hagiography, and it seems that people are forgetting — if they ever knew — the kind of work that Kirk did: which was the maintenance of watch lists for professors who violated conservative orthodoxy, which was demands for the state suppression of his political opponents, which was spreading really awful stuff about racial and gender minorities.</p><p>And so, I’ve also been somewhat troubled by the eulogizing of Kirk as a champion for discourse and dialogue, because I don’t think that stuff constitutes the kind of discourse and dialogue we want to see in our country. I guess I want people to hold two ideas in mind: that this was a tragedy, but that doesn’t somehow mean we should airbrush Kirk’s legacy.</p><p>I took the occasion this morning to read the Times obituary for Father Coughlin and I pulled it up on Times Machine, which New York Times subscribers have access to. Of course, Charles Coughlin was a famed radio demagogue of the 1930s. He was viciously antisemitic and bigoted in many ways and had a huge following through the 1930s. It was interesting to read the obituary, which both recognized his influence and importance but didn’t shy away from the reality of the man. And this is how I feel about Kirk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>We can recognize his influence but we shouldn’t shy away from the reality of the man. As for political violence, I find myself wanting to remind people that the United States has a long history of endemic political violence, and although we do seem to be approaching the return of higher levels of political violence, it’s important for us not to indulge the fantasy that this is somehow foreign to our experience. It’s very much part of the American experience.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> Well, harking back to 1968, which was the year of political violence, I mean — —</p><p><strong>Bouie: </strong>But even before that, right? You can read Lincoln’s Lyceum speech, where he’s decrying mob violence against people who disagree with prevailing views. Elijah Lovejoy <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elijah-P-Lovejoy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was slaughtered</a> for publishing abolitionist tracts. And then there’s the tarring and feathering during the Revolution. I mean, it’s sort of a recurring part of our experience.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> I do take Jamelle’s point about when something like this happens, in a rush to definitely condemn the violence — which everyone should be doing — there is a tendency to kind of whitewash the personalities involved.</p><p>David, what about you? You <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-debate.html" title="">turned around</a> a magnificent look at Kirk and what he meant to the conservative youth movement. What have you made of all of this early kind of remembrance?</p><p><strong>David French:</strong> There are a few things. Going back to Jamelle’s point: When I wrote my piece that was published Thursday morning about Kirk and about the assassination — Charlie and I had a lot of disagreements; we represent very different parts of the broader American right. There were a lot of disagreements there. But I chose not to highlight those in that discussion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>I mentioned that we had disagreements, but I didn’t foreground them for a very specific reason: When you’re looking at the shock, horror and trauma of what just unfolded on that college campus, the gravity of that is so much greater than my political disagreements. I didn’t want to emphasize those in this moment, because I wanted to rest on the most important things — the gravity of the loss of a husband and father, and also how and where it happened.</p><p>The thing that really stuck with me when I got up this morning is that this happened on a college campus. It happened during a debate, or a debate-type event, on a college campus. And rather than hashing these things out, one person chose to end the conversation with a bullet.</p><p>The fact that it occurred on campus, in front of thousands of students, and to a person who, as I wrote in my piece, is almost omnipresent in the social media feeds of politically engaged Gen Zers — all of that matters. It’s very difficult to find a Gen Zer who pays any attention to politics and doesn’t know who Charlie Kirk is. Virtually impossible. Taken together, I think those things make this a more seminal cultural event than we might otherwise think.</p><p>What are students going to be thinking about debate on campus now? People who speak on college campuses — and I know all of us here do — how do we feel approaching an event on a college campus now? These college debates, or discussions, are some of the lifeblood of our democracy. When you have a murder in the middle of a college event, in addition to the horrific tragedy impacting Charlie, his family and his friends, there’s also this radiating impact into the culture — specifically the culture of the college campus. What I’ve been thinking about is both the horror of the moment itself and the ripple effects it’s going to have on American discourse.</p><p><strong>Bouie:</strong> I take that observation, I take that point about the consequence and the weightiness of this particular incident. My response here is less about those making that point and more about what I sense is a kind of sanctification of Kirk as this exemplar of dialogue and discourse in the country. I don’t think that’s an accurate picture of the man who lived. He was prolific, so it’s not particularly difficult to get a good sense of what Kirk believed about things and whose stated beliefs were in essence that people of his ideological persuasion ought to be able to suppress the views of the people they don’t like.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That’s what the professor watch list was — and it’s something his organization continues to maintain: a list of professors, instructors, adjuncts and others on college campuses, targeting their speech if they say things he or his organization don’t like. It’s been strange to me to see Gov. Gavin Newsom praise Kirk as being committed to good-faith discourse, and then to read an entry on this watch list about a professor who wasn’t even speaking in the classroom, but as a private citizen in his own life. At the bottom of the entry, it says: “Contact this person’s employer” — essentially inviting people to harass him, maybe even try to get him fired.</p><p>What I want is for people to be able to do two things at once. As David said, acknowledge that this was a tragedy for Kirk, his family and his friends — something that never should have happened, and something very consequential. But at the same time, we can’t airbrush this man’s life and legacy as a political communicator.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> Well, that is one of the things you see with violence and these sorts of tragedies. It flattens the victim and creates martyrs. Already we’re seeing it; Trump referred to him as a martyr. There’s a pastor in Oklahoma who founded the Pastors for Trump network who said that “Charlie died for what he believed in. He died for something greater than just himself. We hope and we pray that Charlie’s death is not one in vain.” Is this at all worrying, David?</p><p><strong>French:</strong> Yes, it’s all very worrying. I mean, any time you have an event like this, you do have this fork in the road moment. The shock, the horror settles in and then you sort of have this choice: Am I going to use that to stoke rage and hatred and fury against my political opponents? Or I’m going to realize that we are walking down the road to oblivion and I’m going to become a part of a political culture that is going to condemn this unequivocally, commit itself to treating people with decency even across big differences?</p><p>A political culture can tolerate very large differences against a background of decency. It cannot tolerate and survive small differences if the background environment is one that is soaked in violence and hatred. And so one thing that does absolutely concern me is that you are seeing in response that the political leaders, the writers, the pundits, all of those people — every living president has put out a statement about this — you’re seeing a lot of very responsible sober behavior in the political elite. And a lot of these ——</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> Including from characters that you would not necessarily expect, like Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> Totally. You’re seeing a lot of calls for calm, a lot of calls for peace, a lot of calls for reconciliation, and that’s one path to walk down. That’s the path we should go down. I’m also seeing calls for civil war, for unrelenting vengeance, mass raids, mass police raids against political opponents. That’s your fork in the road every time you have political violence: which path you’re going to walk.</p><p>I’m seeing a lot of people online — thankfully not most of the political elites or whatever — but it’s still a lot of people online taking that path towards more vengeance, viewing politics not as an arena of disagreement on important matters but as a blood feud. That is one of the principal things that’s alarming me right now.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> So, Jamelle, you mentioned President Trump.</p><p><strong><em>Audio clip of President Trump:</em></strong><em> “For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today. And it must stop right now.”</em></p><p>And he went further than that, saying that he was going to root all this out. What we have that’s new in these situations today that we didn’t have, say, in the 1960s or before is, we have the immediate outlet of social media where we were watching people grieve in real time last night and rage in real time. A lot of the responses were appalling, whether it was people gloating over the violence or people calling for the left to be tracked down and destroyed. I’m hoping that 24 hours in, 36 hours in, everyone will have had a moment to catch their breath. I mean, where do we think this is going?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Bouie:</strong> I don’t know. It is simply true that the president and his allies do want the state suppression of their political opponents. I think they’re very open about that. I think they’re probably looking for some excuse; I doubt this will be the excuse.</p><p>One thing about these sorts of events is that the perpetrators, contrary to what some people might wish, don’t usually have particularly coherent political beliefs or ideologies. They act in ways that are often inscrutable. My suspicion is that if and when authorities find the shooter in this case, they’ll discover someone whose beliefs are a grab bag of nonsense. That was the case with the shooter in Pennsylvania who targeted Trump — his views were also a grab bag of nonsense.</p><p>That’s true of so many would-be or successful assassins: Their belief structures just don’t make sense. That makes it more difficult to use the event as a rallying cry for some kind of crackdown. One thing I want to add, reflecting on what David just said, is: If this had happened to someone else, what do we think Charlie Kirk’s reaction would’ve been? It would’ve been exactly the kind of thing we’re now decrying.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Bouie:</strong> Maybe it’s too soon for this kind of conversation, but in keeping with trying to be honest about Kirk’s life as it was lived, I think we should acknowledge that his work contributed to the kind of political atmosphere where people rage about civil war and crackdowns against their political enemies. <strong>Cottle:</strong> Although I do think that I saw a quote from him about decrying political violence.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> One of the things that’s made the rounds is he’s saying when we stop talking to each other, that is when violence occurs, or something along those lines. I think there was one ——</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>Bouie:</strong> I mean, after the attack on Paul Pelosi, Kirk made light of the attacker —</p><p><strong>French: </strong>He did, I remember.</p><p><strong>Cottle: </strong>That was disgusting.</p><p><strong><em>Audio clip of Charlie Kirk:</em></strong><em> Why is he still in jail, why has he not been bailed out? By the way, if some amazing patriot out there in San Francisco or the bay area wants to really be a midterm hero, someone should go and bail this guy out — I bet his bail is $30,000 to $40,000 — bail him out and then go ask him some questions.</em></p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> It’s interesting that you point to Paul Pelosi because one of the things that’s different about the Charlie Kirk situation is, this is not a politician. So it is not Donald Trump. It is not the Minnesota lawmaker, Melissa Hortman. Paul Pelosi was not himself in the political arena. Now, Pelosi was kind of collateral damage from somebody who was seeking out his wife, whereas Charlie Kirk was himself the target here. But it does speak to the widening circle of political violence.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> I’m glad you’re bringing that up, Michelle, because I think this is a horrific evolution that was inevitable. One reason it was inevitable is the shift in prominence and power between politicians and the world of influencers and pundits, especially on the right.</p><p>I think Charlie Kirk might be the single most successful conservative not named Donald Trump since the Trump era. Which Republican elected official had more influence over the Republican public, aside from Trump, than Charlie Kirk? Honestly, I think Charlie Kirk had more hold, particularly over young Republicans, than any other Republican politician.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>As the influencer and pundit class has grown in power and influence, you start to see that in a world of escalating political violence, this was never going to be contained to politicians. One thing we’ve all seen in this era is that if you speak out on issues of public concern, whether you’re on the left or the right, you’re going to face blowback, including threats and acts of intimidation. This has become omnipresent; journalist after journalist could tell you that this has been their experience. I’ve long felt it was just a matter of time before something like this happened.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> Jamelle, did you have anything you wanted to throw in on that?</p><p><strong>Bouie: </strong>What I’m struggling with is trying to understand why we’ve had this nationwide outpouring in a way that we didn’t for the assassination of Melissa Hortman in June. The intimidation and threats of violence against judges and election workers are basically invisible to most people. We’re talking as if it hasn’t been happening, even though, just beneath the surface for the last five years, there has been ongoing political violence. Maybe it’s not always as dramatic as this, but it’s certainly real and has very real victims.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> Well, isn’t part of that because there is a video of the actual shooting?</p><p><strong>Bouie: </strong>That might just be it.</p><p><strong>Cottle: </strong>It happened. So it’s not just that he was shot and it is caught in gruesome video images, it’s that it was on also a college campus. That triggers something with a lot of the public. You had all these terrified kids running and recording this and texting people, “Are you safe?” It was a very dramatic example of what is usually something that people hear very antiseptically after the fact. And for obvious reasons, you don’t want to put these images out there unnecessarily, but in this case you couldn’t repress it. It was out there.</p><p><strong>Bouie: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>French:</strong> Images matter so much. There wouldn’t have been the reaction to George Floyd’s murder that we saw if all the information we had had come as just a press release or eyewitness testimony about the circumstances. The combination of the circumstances with the omnipresence of social media and the attention of Gen Z America — the place, the images, the video, the audience — made this shocking and jolting for a lot of understandable reasons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>One other thing that’s making all of this worse is seeing people continually repeating online that “the political violence is all coming from the left.” I’m pretty convinced, having spent much of my life in very red areas, that a lot of these people could take a lie-detector test and pass it, thinking this is all coming from the left or that only the left celebrates political violence. Meanwhile, we’ve seen a movement that had the Jan. 6 prison choir opening a recorded version of the national anthem at some of Trump’s rallies. And yet people say with a straight face that only the left celebrates political violence.</p><p>This is a huge problem. There’s a long history of right-wing political violence, including deadly incidents and mass shootings. So it’s incumbent upon those of us with a memory longer than a goldfish to place this in context: America has a political violence problem.</p><p>Part of what makes this problem worse is when our partisan blinders convince us that our own community is under siege, while other communities are the aggressors. That mind-set only reinforces an apocalyptic vision and fuels the kind of “civil war” conversation you see popping up in dark corners of the internet.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> I mean, that’s one of the reasons, or the main reason, why it was so disappointing to see Trump go there in his video yesterday about Kirk. He focused solely on the left and he drilled down on the idea that his team is under assault. I do think it probably is something of — not a revelation, but I do think most of the folks on the left would flip that script and say, well, it is absolutely the right that is the problem. It is two different realities that people are functioning in.</p><p><strong>Bouie:</strong> From an empirical standpoint, to the extent you can categorize stuff, it is the case that more political violence comes from what you would describe as the right than it does from the left. And I’d say that if you’re looking for forces in the culture that have unleashed this, you could make a very strong and empirically grounded case that Donald Trump’s presence in American politics has had an instigating effect on comfort with the use of violence and violent rhetoric against political opponents. I don’t think that is a stretch.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>A thought I have is about this term “political violence&#34; and how it’s more amorphous than it appears. It tends to designate certain kinds of violence — mainly violence against recognizable political figures — while other types of violence or threats are treated as background noise in American politics, not necessarily worthy of being called political violence.</p><p>It also excludes violence from the state against individuals, which is a complicated topic. The target of violence shapes our notions of what counts as political violence, beyond just being a political figure. I think it’s important to acknowledge that.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> So the violence speaks to the fact that politics is seen as existential. I mean, the House couldn’t even have a moment of silence for Kirk without it degenerating into squabbling. Is there a way that this could help turn down the temperature, or are we still too much in the thick of the fever at this point?</p><p><strong>Bouie:</strong> I don’t think so. It is my view that the fever, as it were, is not just simply a spontaneous result of all Americans engaging in getting angry at each other. There are specific people that we can readily identify who have made it their work to heighten tensions.</p><p>At the National Conservative Conference last week, the far-right influencer activist Jack Posobiec spoke on the theme of his book, which is called “Unhumans,” and the argument of the book is that people on the left are not actually human beings deserving of respect and dignity. He spoke and received applause. This is a gathering of influential people in the world of modern-day conservatism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Last year, during his campaign, the president of the United States referred to immigrants, people on the left, and any of his political opponents as “poisoning the blood of the nation,” essentially calling people he opposes little more than vermin. Why would this event lead these people to moderate their rhetoric, to stop speaking about others as subhuman? What we’re seeing right now is that they’re not moderating; instead, they’re making assumptions about the causes — assuming, for example, that this was the act of some left-wing assassin — and using it as an opportunity to push their own agenda.</p><p>And I’ll say, to be honest, that a lot of these figures on the right, their response to Kirk’s killing was this: We have to have a civil war. We have to round them up. Chris Rufo was doing this; a bunch of these guys were doing this. These were supposed to be Kirk’s friends, and his body’s not even cold and they’re already weaponizing it.</p><p>I obviously had no sympathy for Kirk’s politics, but I would think that if I were one of his friends who shared his politics, that I would not be using his untimely demise for my narrow partisan political purposes. The fact that that is what happened, I think, is a testament to the fact that there’s no path from this for these particular people to turn down the temperature.</p><p><strong>Cottle: </strong>David?</p><p><strong>French: </strong>One thing we haven’t talked about, which I think is worth mentioning, is the danger posed by social media in the wake of the shooting. It’s an ideal opportunity for malign actors online to do what they do. It has become abundantly clear that a lot of American political conflict isn’t just driven by real people engaging in apocalyptic or hateful rhetoric. We also have influence operations using social media to amplify existing cracks and fissures in American life. Events like this are perfect opportunities for that.</p><p>You start to see things like, “Look at this horrible person celebrating Charlie Kirk’s death — they got 44,000 likes,” as if that is a genuine measure of the left. Or someone calling for civil war, like that vile post from Andrew Tate that got over 100,000 likes. You could interpret that as a groundswell of hatred for the left or Charlie Kirk from the left, or a craving for civil war from the right. But we have to realize that some of this isn’t real. Some of what’s stoking outrage isn’t coming from genuine participants at all.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Social media not only draws a type of participant who isn’t representative of the median American voter, but some of those participants aren’t even real. That’s why this is, in some ways, even more perilous: It gives people the chance to use our own technology against us once again.</p><p><strong>Cottle:</strong> All right, I have to admit that anytime something horrible is trending on social media, my mind automatically goes to: How much of this is a Russian bot, a foreign influencer or just some sinister, not really American reaction to it? I know that makes me sound strange or paranoid, but I’m just going to admit that upfront. With that, and with a nod to social media and those shadowy forces, I want to say I’m glad we’re all real participants here, talking through some of our disagreements this week.</p><p>I really appreciate your thoughts on this, as always. Guys, thanks so much.</p><p><strong>French: </strong>Thank you so much, Michelle.</p><p><strong>Bouie:</strong> Thank you very much.
