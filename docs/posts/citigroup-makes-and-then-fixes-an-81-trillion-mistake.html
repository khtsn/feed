But rarely do they involve moving funds that dwarf the gross domestic product of every country in the world.</p><p>Citigroup accidentally credited a client’s account with $81 trillion when it meant to send only $280, the latest mistake at a bank that is struggling to repair its reputation after a string of errors in recent years.</p><p>The massive transfer, which occurred last April and far exceeds Citi’s stock market value of about $150 billion, was initially missed by two employees and was caught 90 minutes after it was posted, The Financial Times first <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9921925e-5a32-48cc-a3e3-3f77042477d2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. No funds left the bank, and Citi told the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency about the error, calling it a “near miss.”</p><p>The mistake was the latest in a string of glitches at the bank. In 2022, a Citi employee caused <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-02/citi-s-fat-finger-trade-seen-costing-bank-more-than-50-million?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a crash in Europe</a> by accidentally adding a zero to a trade, igniting a sell-off that at one point erased 300 billion euros, or about $322 billion, from European stocks. Last year, British regulators fined Citi 62 million pounds, about $78 million, for the incident.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 2020, Citigroup <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/business/citibank-revlon-loan.html" title="">accidentally wired $900 million</a> to a group of lenders locked in a bitter fight with Revlon, the beauty company.</p><p>That year, U.S. regulators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/business/citigroup-fine-risk-management.html" title="">also fined Citi $400 million</a>, saying the bank had failed to address issues in its risk management procedures and internal controls.</p><p>Citi’s problems with technology and internal systems contributed to the departure of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/citi-s-corbat-has-parting-words-banking-is-quickly-changing?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Corbat</a> as chief executive of the bank in 2021.
