    <h1>Hollywood and Bollywood Kickoff Diwali in New York</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Fifteen years ago, Anjula Acharia hosted an intimate Diwali party with about 40 guests <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/10/desi-hits-lights-up-new-york-city" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in her TriBeCa apartment</a>. She wanted to invite her friends to celebrate the Hindu festival of lights, which she grew up observing with her family in Buckinghamshire, England, a suburb roughly 50 miles northwest of London.</p><p>Ms. Acharia, an entrepreneur who also manages the actress Priyanka Chopra, has organized the party almost every year since, usually in her apartment or at a friend’s house. In 2019, she brought it to the Pierre hotel.</p><p>Now, called the All That Glitters Diwali Ball, the event is a glamorous affair and one of the most visible Diwali gatherings in the country, filled with pre-eminent South Asian musicians, politicians, fashion designers and business executives.</p><p>“It’s just gotten bigger and better,” Ms. Acharia said, noting that five years ago, she struggled to find sponsors for décor and food. “Now, we’ve had a battle for sponsors.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Saturday, about 300 guests descended a grand staircase inside the Pierre in their most elegant South Asian attire — some in their bedazzled wedding lehengas — and into the party where Punjabi tracks played from the stereo.</p><p>The comedian Hasan Minhaj posed for photos with the actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Ali Sethi, a singer and songwriter, chatted with Avantika Vandanapu, who starred in “Mean Girls,” the 2024 film.</p></div></div><div

It’s our food, it’s our music, it’s our fashion.”</p><p>An assortment of South Asian dishes, including lamb biryani, pav bhaji and pani puri, were served buffet style. At about 10 p.m., Ms. Acharia made her way to the front of the room where she shared her Diwali wish.</p><p>“We know there’s sadness in the world, and it always challenges me to throw this party and see what’s happening,” Ms. Acharia said. She partnered with World Central Kitchen, particularly for their work in Gaza, Ukraine and areas affected by Hurricane Helene, and asked guests to donate.</p><p>Nora Fatehi, the Canadian Moroccan dancer and singer based in Mumbai, then performed a medley of her popular Bollywood dance numbers, including “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFcgOboQZ08" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dilbar</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uUdJalMaF8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">O Saki Saki</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B6T8O15Ohk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manike</a>.” The night ended with a ladies versus gentlemen dance-off as the singer Jay Sean emceed.</p><p>We asked partygoers about their outfits, their favorite Diwali memories and what this gathering meant to them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><em>Interviews have been edited.</em></p><hr/><h2 id="link-384c256a">Avantika Vandanapu</h2><p>Actress</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your outfit.</strong> It’s very unlike me. I’m South Indian, so more often than not, I’m wearing a traditional sari, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/fashion/falguni-peacock-met-gala-red-carpet-rihanna-beyonce.html" title="">Falguni Shane Peacock</a> offered to dress me tonight. It’s so exciting to be getting dressed by a designer that you’ve admired from afar for so long.</p><p><strong>What’s your favorite Diwali memory?</strong> Falling asleep to the sound of everyone’s laughter and being carried to bed, and waking up in my lehenga.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6fb9e4e0">Falguni and Shane Peacock</h2><p>Fashion designers</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Many people here are wearing Falguni Shane Peacock.</strong></p><p><strong>Shane Peacock:</strong> Everywhere I look, I can see our clothes.

And I think in terms of fashion, it’s a celebration of color, maximalism, joy, community. It’s such a very cool New York diaspora thing to be a part of.</p><p><strong>What your favorite South Asian food?</strong> Oh, this is divisive. Biryani is obvious, of course biryani. I feel like khichdi is slept on. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019202-khichdi" title="">Khichdi</a> as a cuisine can be amazing — any version. What I want is your mom’s version. That’s the go-to.

And the thing is, fireworks are actually legal in England. So we’d go and buy so many fireworks. Back garden, food, drink, music — it’s just a good time.</p><p><strong>What’s your favorite era of South Asian music?</strong> I still love ’90s Bollywood music — those emotional songs that pull at your heart’s strings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-12c559">Alok Vaid-Menon</h2><p>Writer and comedian</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your outfit.</strong> I’m wearing one of my favorite designers named <a href="https://www.papadontpreach.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Papa Don’t Preach</a> based out of Mumbai. Shubhika, the designer, is a dear friend of mine. She designed this outfit for me when I was performing in Mumbai earlier this year in February.</p><p><strong>Why is this gathering important to you?</strong> Growing up, Diwali was such an essential part of my life. I was always worried: Am I going to lose this as a queer and trans person? And it feels really important for my inner child as an adult to be able to be here as the fullest expression of myself. Because when I was younger, I couldn’t wear the things that I wanted to wear.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><h2 id="link-c16f6d5">Sabyasachi Mukherjee</h2><p>Fashion designer</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>Did you grow up celebrating Diwali?</strong> I’m Bengali, so we don’t call it Diwali. We call it Kali Puja. I have very fond memories of it. My father used to make firecrackers at home, he taught me how to do it because he was a chemical engineer.</p><p><strong>Is this your first time coming to this event?</strong> Yes. It’s incredible how India is being recognized in the U.S. I came in yesterday, just for the party. I flew from Kolkata, and I fly back tomorrow morning. I’m absolutely jet-lagged out of my wits, but just being here makes me happy because you just realize you’re a part of a larger global network.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-7528695d">Imran Amed</h2><p>The founder and chief executive of The Business of Fashion</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your look tonight.</strong> I met the designer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/magazine/sabyasachi-profile.html" title="">Sabyasachi</a> in 2006 in New York, and he was making his first foray into the fashion week scene here. We maintained a friendship. So when I was coming to this event, he was my first choice to get dressed.

I’m wearing a sherwani from Lahore. I’m wearing these vintage retro grandma sunglasses. They remind me of my grandmother who used to celebrate Diwali as a child.</p><p><strong>Is this your first year coming to this event?</strong> Second year. I think it’s very important and special because there are fewer and fewer spaces in South Asia where you can have this kind of inclusive, joyous celebration of our sensibility as opposed to our narrowly demarcated identity.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-52c22656">Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</h2><p>Actress</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-48"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amir Hamja for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p><strong>Tell me about your outfit.</strong> Anita Dongre. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/fashion/anita-dongre-kate-middleton-grassroot.html" title="">Jewelry, too</a>.

This is my first time I’ve ever celebrated Diwali because my family is Tamil, of Sri Lankan origin. We celebrate holidays like Thai Pongal and Tamil New Year.</p><p><strong>What’s your favorite South Asian song?</strong> “Raa Raa” from “Chandramukhi,” a Tamil film — so good.
