</span> <a href="https://x.com/T1/status/1822831242485903364" target="_blank">announced</a> they have parted ways with coach <span data-ref-id="1">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/27679/daeda">
		Daeda	</a>
</span>, who has been with the organization since February 2024. </p>

<p>The decision, according to Daeda, is one that has been on the cards for a while.</p>

<p>“Going into the T1 project for 2024, I was fairly confident early on that it would be my only season with T1 as rumblings of a domestic focus was planned for 2025,” he said, revealing some insight into what the offseason may look like for T1&#39;s roster.</p>

<p>Daeda also <a href="https://x.com/T1_Daeda/status/1822830618905919690" target="_blank">announced</a> he is looking for a staff role in a team, whether it be as a coach, analyst or manager.</p>

<p>He also stated that he is “looking to support another project going into next year, regardless of level or region.”</p>

<p>Before joining T1, Daeda worked as a head coach for <span data-ref-id="2">

<p>The move is one of many in what&#39;s been a busy offseason for T1, which began with their failure to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2097/valorant-champions-2024" target="_blank">Champions Seoul</a>. Before the beginning of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 2</a>, the organization picked up restricted free agent and long-time DRX player <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/485/stax">
		stax	</a>
</span>, while benching <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/1129/rossy">
		Rossy	</a>
</span>.</p>

<p>Since then, <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4545/sayaplayer">
		Sayaplayer	</a>
</span> has announced his restricted free agency, while Rossy also <a href="https://x.com/RossyUA/status/1815008878209138921" target="_blank">announced</a> that he is looking for a team.</p>

<p>Rossy announced that while he is a restricted free agent at the moment, the organization will be terminating his contract in the near future.</p>

<p>The team also <a href="https://x.com/T1/status/1822832881544159472" target="_blank">announced</a> the contract of long-time coach <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13109/stunner">
		Stunner	</a>
</span> coming to an end on Sunday, too. Stunner has been LFT since July, following the team&#39;s elimination from Pacific Stage 2, and has been looking for a new role since.</p>
