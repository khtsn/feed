Owens last June as the 35-year-old mother of four stood outside a door to Ms. Lorincz’s home in Ocala, a city about 80 miles northwest of Orlando.</p><p>The two neighbors had been involved in an ongoing dispute over neighborhood children — including Ms. Owens’s — playing near Ms. Lorincz’s home, the authorities said.</p><p>After Ms. Lorincz argued with the children and threw things at them, Ms. Owens went to Ms. Lorincz’s door to confront her, the police said. Ms. Lorincz fired a handgun through the door, striking Ms. Owens in the chest. She was not armed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Ms. Lorincz, whose lawyers argued that she had acted in self-defense, faces up to 30 years in prison. A sentencing date has not been set.</p><p>The panel of six jurors, who The Associated Press reported were all white, delivered its verdict after deliberating for just over two hours after closing arguments on Friday. The trial began on Tuesday.</p><p>“We’ve achieved some justice for Ajike,” Pamela Dias, Ajike Owens’s mother, told reporters outside of the courtroom after the verdict, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/white-woman-shoots-black-neighbor-florida-trial-0520687894e390dc8f0b1df7eea9f30c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Associated Press</a>. “My heart is a little lighter.”</p><p>Bill Gladson, the state attorney for the Fifth Judicial Circuit of Florida, said in a statement that “while today’s verdict can’t bring A.J. back, we hope it brings some measure of justice and peace to her family and friends.”</p><p>Lawyers for Ms. Lorincz declined to comment.</p><p>The case has garnered national attention for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/us/florida-mother-shooting-stand-your-ground.html" title="">delay</a> in the arrest of Ms. Lorincz, because of the Florida’s “stand your ground” law, and the fact that prosecutors ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/us/susan-lorincz-manslaughter-charges-florida.html" title="">decided to charge her with manslaughter</a>, not second-degree murder.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Not only was Susan Lorincz on trial today but so was stand your ground,” Anthony Thomas, a lawyer for the Owens family, said in a news conference after the verdict.</p><p>Ms. Owens’s family, activists and lawyers, including Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer who has played a prominent role in the Black Lives Matter movement, had called for the higher charge.</p><p>Mr. Crump and other lawyers working with the family had said Ms. Lorincz yelled racial slurs at Ms. Owens’s children. One of Ms. Owens’s sons was standing next to her when she was shot.</p><p>The case also reignited debate around “stand your ground” laws, which exist in about 30 states and offer legal protections for people who said they feared for their safety when they used deadly force.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Susan Lorincz, left, listens to testimony during her trial in Ocala, Fla. on Aug. 14, 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Engle/Ocala Star-Banner, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>On the day of the shooting, June 2, 2023, Ms. Lorincz shouted at the children and threw an umbrella and roller skates at them, according to the authorities. When Ms. Owens heard what had happened, she went to Ms. Lorincz’s apartment complex, the authorities said.</p></div><div><div><p>During the trial, the defense said that Ms. Owens grew enraged after hearing that Ms. Lorincz had shouted and thrown things at the children and that she had threatened to kill Ms. Lorincz when she appeared at her door, causing her to panic.</p><p>In recordings shared during the trial, Ms. Lorincz told detectives that as Ms. Owens pounded on her door, Ms. Lorincz had feared for her life. One of her lawyers, Morris Carranza, said in opening arguments, “A.J. was pounding, and she was cursing.”</p><p>A neighbor testified to hearing loud pounding and shouting, though she could not make out what was being said. She called 911 after hearing a loud pop.</p><p>Ms. Lorincz did not testify.</p><p>Prosecutors argued that the door to the apartment was locked and pointed out that Ms. Owens was unarmed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The confrontation was the culmination of several incidents in a continuing feud between Ms. Lorincz and Ms. Owens about the children, including about where they had been playing, according to the authorities. Ms. Owens’s family has pointed to the escalating nature of the feud and claimed that Ms. Lorincz had been out to harm Ms. Owens all along.</p><p>In an affidavit after Ms. Lorincz’s arrest, a detective said Ms. Lorincz said she had repeatedly complained about the children and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/us/ajike-owens-shooting-death-neighbor-florida-friday" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admitted to using racial slurs</a> toward them before the shooting.</p><p>In explaining his decision not to bring a murder charge in the case, Mr. Gladson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/us/susan-lorincz-manslaughter-charges-florida.html" title="">said</a> there was not enough evidence to prove that Ms. Lorincz was in a “depraved” state of mind at the time of the killing — defined as having “hatred, spite, ill will or evil intent toward the victim” — and said that he would not “allow any decision to be influenced by public sentiment.”</p><p>Ms. Owens’s family has criticized the fact that no Black people had been selected for the jury. The Marion County court clerk’s office <a href="https://apnews.com/article/white-woman-shoots-black-neighbor-florida-trial-9ea9ca2a31afcbb3152181caacea6da2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> that the initial jury pool of 70 people had included eight Black people.</p><p>Florida’s “stand your ground” law drew national attention when the police cited it as the reason they did not arrest George Zimmerman in the 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. He was later charged, but acquitted the following year, prompting demonstrations.</p><p>Hank Sanders contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
