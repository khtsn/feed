It came on Sept. 26, the same day the indictment was unsealed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The mayor’s haul was less than half the amount raised by Brad Lander, the city comptroller, who took in just over $315,000 for his mayoral campaign.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was also 51 percent less than what Mr. Adams raised during the same period last year, when he received almost $296,000 in donations.</p><p>Scott M. Stringer, a former city comptroller who is running for mayor, raised $180,000 in the last three months. Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn who is also running but is less well known, raised $137,000.</p><p>“The special interest and permanent government money has turned off the spigot,” Mr. Stringer said about Mr. Adams’s fund-raising numbers.</p><p>Mr. Adams has raised a total of $4.1 million for his 2025 re-election campaign. That money could unlock another $4.3 million in matching funds — putting him above the $7.93 million spending cap for the June primary. It is unclear whether the mayor will qualify for matching funds, which have not yet been disbursed.</p><p>The mayor and his campaign’s compliance lawyer, Vito Pitta, said that fund-raising efforts slowed in recent months because the campaign was close to raising the maximum amount it could spend in the primary. With the $146,000 in new contributions, Mr. Pitta said, the campaign has now hit that mark “far ahead of schedule.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We had just a small amount to raise,” Mr. Adams said on Tuesday. “And so based on whatever is required, I always step up to the plate to do what is required.”</p><p>However, most candidates in Mr. Adams’s position continue to raise money for the general election in November, where candidates can spend another $7.93 million.</p><p>“They don’t just stop. That never happens,” said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a good-government group. The mayor’s reasoning, he said, was a “convenient fig leaf for the fact that his donations have dried up.”</p><p>Even the $250 donation to Mr. Adams on Sept. 26 was shrouded in some mystery. The contribution came from Mike Koba, a Queens man who was listed as being unemployed. Yet numerous records and a company website suggest that he owns Koba Capital Insurance Brokers, a New York firm.</p><p>Regarding the donor’s employment status, Mr. Pitta said, “That is the information self-reported by the contributor.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Koba’s LinkedIn profile includes a picture of him with Mr. Adams. He donated $250 to the mayor in August. When reached by The New York Times and asked to explain the discrepancy, Mr. Koba said that what was listed was “not accurate” but declined to elaborate.</p><p>“Now is not the right time for me,” said Mr. Koba, who said his wife was about to have a baby.</p><p>Mr. Adams is accused of conspiring with foreign nationals to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/nyregion/eric-adams-campaign-donations-matching.html" title="">illegally funnel money to his 2021 and 2025 mayoral campaigns</a> through so-called straw donors. The indictment also detailed instances in which Mr. Adams’s 2021 campaign encouraged businessmen to circumvent contribution limits by having their employees make donations and then reimbursing them.</p><p>Mr. Adams’s campaign, the indictment said, would later boost these donations using the city’s matching funds program, which awards candidates $8 for every dollar they receive from a city resident up to the first $250.</p><p>There have been calls to bar Mr. Adams’s 2025 campaign from tapping into the program. Lincoln Restler, a city councilman from Brooklyn who leads the committee that oversees the Campaign Finance Board, sent a letter to the board last month asking it <a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnRestler/status/1839387442887208993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1839387442887208993%7Ctwgr%5E99be4306b6dd624759fbef7c8e54d31651aa0451%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F10%2F11%2Fnyregion%2Fmayor-adams-election-fund-raising.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not to award</a> the mayor any matching funds.</p><p>Both Mr. Lander and Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens who is running for mayor, have also said that Mr. Adams should not receive matching funds. The Campaign Finance Board will make a decision on the matter in December.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a statement, Rebecca Rodriguez, a senior adviser to Mr. Lander, contrasted the comptroller’s “strong fund-raising” with the “major questions swirling around Eric Adams’s ability to qualify for matching funds due to his federal indictment.”</p><p>Mr. Adams declined to answer most questions about fund-raising at his weekly news conference on Tuesday, including whether Brianna Suggs, his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/nyregion/brianna-suggs-adams.html" title="">former chief fund-raiser whose home was raided by the F.B.I. in November</a>, still worked for him.</p><p>The filing listed a payment of $2,925 to Ms. Suggs from June 9, 2023, which is outside the filing period. The last payment she received was in April.</p><p>The mayor has also been fund-raising for his legal defense fund, which is required to report third-quarter donations by midnight Tuesday. As of the last filing, the fund had raised $1.7 million and spent $1.1 million.</p><p>The latest campaign disclosures show that Mr. Adams’s 2025 mayoral campaign paid $14,000 to Michael Giaccio, who was also separately retained to raise money for the legal defense fund. Mr. Giaccio’s firm, Bedford Grove, also received $26,375 on July 31.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Bianca Pallaro is a Times reporter who combines traditional reporting with data analysis skills to investigate wrongdoing and explain complex issues by turning numbers into insightful information.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bianca-pallaro">More about Bianca Pallaro</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>21</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Donations To Adams  Plummet  After Charges<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
