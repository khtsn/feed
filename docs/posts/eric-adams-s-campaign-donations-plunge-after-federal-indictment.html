It came from one unemployed donor on Sept. 26, the same day the federal indictment was unsealed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The mayor’s haul was less than half the amount raised by Brad Lander, the city comptroller, who took in just over $315,000 for his mayoral campaign.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was also 51 percent less than what Mr. Adams raised during the same period last year, when he received almost $296,000 in donations.</p><p>Scott M. Stringer, a former city comptroller who is running for mayor, raised $180,000 in the last three months. Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn who is also running for the office but is less well known, raised $137,000.</p><p>“The special interest and permanent government money has turned off the spigot,” Mr. Stringer said about Mr. Adams’s fund-raising numbers.</p><p>Mr. Adams has raised a total of $4.1 million for his 2025 mayoral re-election campaign. That money could unlock another $4.3 million in matching funds — putting him above the $7.93 million spending cap for the June primary. It is unclear whether the mayor will qualify for matching funds, which have not yet been disbursed.</p><p>In a statement, Vito Pitta, a compliance lawyer for the Adams campaign, said that “Mayor Adams’s strong support from New Yorkers continues — and the campaign has now raised the maximum amount it can spend in the primary with anticipated matching funds for his re-election far ahead of schedule.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The mayor is accused of conspiring with foreign nationals to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/nyregion/eric-adams-campaign-donations-matching.html" title="">illegally funnel money into his 2021 and 2025 mayoral campaigns</a> through so-called straw donors. The indictment also detailed instances in which Mr. Adams’s 2021 campaign encouraged businessmen to circumvent contribution limits by having their employees make donations and then reimbursing them.</p><p>Mr. Adams’s campaign, the indictment said, would later boost these donations using the city’s matching funds program, which awards candidates $8 for every dollar they receive from a city resident up to the first $250.</p><p>There have been calls to bar Mr. Adams’s 2025 campaign from tapping into the program. Lincoln Restler, a city councilman from Brooklyn who leads the committee that oversees the Campaign Finance Board, sent a letter to the board last month asking it <a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnRestler/status/1839387442887208993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1839387442887208993%7Ctwgr%5E99be4306b6dd624759fbef7c8e54d31651aa0451%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F10%2F11%2Fnyregion%2Fmayor-adams-election-fund-raising.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not to award</a> the mayor any matching funds.</p><p>Both Mr. Lander and Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens who is running for mayor, have also said that Mr. Adams should not receive matching funds. The Campaign Finance Board will make a decision on the matter in December.</p><p>In a statement, Rebecca Rodriguez, a senior adviser to Mr. Lander, contrasted the comptroller’s “strong fund-raising” with the “major questions swirling around Eric Adams’s ability to qualify for matching funds due to his federal indictment.”</p><p>Mr. Adams filed his donations by Friday’s reporting deadline, according to the Campaign Finance Board, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/nyregion/mayor-adams-election-fund-raising.html" title="">but unlike his mayoral challengers</a>, he did not immediately publicize his numbers.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Bianca Pallaro is a Times reporter who combines traditional reporting with data analysis skills to investigate wrongdoing and explain complex issues by turning numbers into insightful information.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bianca-pallaro">More about Bianca Pallaro</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
