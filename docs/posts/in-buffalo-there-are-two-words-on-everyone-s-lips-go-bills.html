Outside, the temperature hovered in the single digits and lake-effect snow whistled sideways past the picture window.</p><p>Inside, patrons were warmed by a sturdy heater, plentiful drinks and the main topic in town. As everyone at the bar, the Alley Cat, knew — as everyone in western New York knew — the Bills were still alive in the National Football League playoffs, and even a state of weather emergency could not chill the hope that their time had finally come.</p><p>“We’ve put up with a lot,” Mr. Skinner said. “Buffalo needs this.”</p><p>There are many sports teams with long-frustrated supporters: Lions fans, Pirates fans, Vikings supporters and all those who root for the Mets, Jets or Cleveland Guardians. All claim a certain level of misery.</p><p>But it’s different in Buffalo.</p><p>Mr. Skinner was born in the city in 1945, sold beer at the old Rockpile (the Bills’ first home) in the 1960s, and despite all the suffering, remains a loyal fan. To illustrate it, he carefully extracted a relic from his wallet. It was a ticket from Super Bowl XXVII, a bit crinkled and slightly frayed around the edges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He has cherished it for 32 years: a memento from a game in which the Bills were destroyed by the Dallas Cowboys, 52-17. It was Buffalo’s third straight Super Bowl loss. That is the past that Bills fans are left holding.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/24buffalo-fans--pgcl/24buffalo-fans--pgcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/24buffalo-fans--pgcl/24buffalo-fans--pgcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/24buffalo-fans--pgcl/24buffalo-fans--pgcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A Black man, his gray beard visible in the top right corner of the frame, holds up a wrinkled ticket to to Super Bowl XXVII." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/24buffalo-fans--pgcl/24buffalo-fans--pgcl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/24buffalo-fans--pgcl/24buffalo-fans--pgcl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/24buffalo-fans--pgcl/24buffalo-fans--pgcl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/24buffalo-fans--pgcl/24buffalo-fans--pgcl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d15a006f-97e4-59c0-b63d-52c4a27d1609" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maceo Skinner, sitting at the bar at the Alley Cat in Buffalo, shows off an emblem of his loyalty to the Bills: a cherished ticket to the 1993 Super Bowl, which the team lost to the Dallas Cowboys.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
