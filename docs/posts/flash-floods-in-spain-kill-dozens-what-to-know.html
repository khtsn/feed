The floods, after heavy rain started Monday, were some of the country’s worst in decades.</p><p>The death toll is expected to rise as some people are still missing, and more rain is forecast.</p><p>Villages in the hardest hit region, Valencia, were submerged and roads turned into powerful, muddy rivers. Videos shared online by residents and emergency services showed cars piling up as they were swept away by rushing water. In <a href="https://x.com/JaviNakama_/status/1851444652437622885" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one</a>, a woman and her dog are lifted to safety from neck-high waters by a helicopter crew. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-53ef9002">Where are the floods?</h2><p>The floods were worst in eastern and southern Spain, including in areas that often see autumn rains. But some residents said they were shocked by the amount of rainfall this week. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The vast majority of the people who have been reported killed were in Valencia, a coastal region that includes the city of the same name. The city of Valencia, a popular tourist destination, reported considerable damage, with flooding on major roads and in the subway system.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Other locations that were severely affected were Cheste, a traditional farming village; the mountain village of Barx and the villages of Utiel and Carcaixent.</p><h2 id="link-51196009">Did climate change play a role?</h2><p>Meteorologists said that the rainfall was likely the result of a sudden cold drop, known in Spanish as a “gota fría.” That happens when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, allowing the hotter, moister air at the surface to rise quickly and produce robust rain clouds. A storm system pushed the moisture-rich clouds into Spain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Estimating the influence of climate change on any single flood event requires further scientific analysis, but scientists have said that global warming is making storms in many regions more intense. Warmer air holds, and releases, more water.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescuers search for missing people among debris brought by the floods in Letur, in the province of Albacete, Spain.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manu/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Mediterranean is also getting hotter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/climate/central-europe-floods-global-warming.html" title="">hitting its highest ever recorded</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/climate/central-europe-floods-global-warming.html" title="">temperature</a> in August.</p><p>Scientists convened by the United Nations have found no consistent trend in the way global warming was affecting extreme rainfall in the Mediterranean region, which includes Southern Europe and North Africa. Climate models indicate, however, that if nations allow global warming to worsen in the coming decades, downpours in the region will most likely become heavier and more frequent.</p><h2 id="link-6bf5a40f">What damage have the floods caused?</h2><p>The death toll jumped dramatically throughout the day on Wednesday.<span>  </span>More people are still missing, but the authorities in Valencia could not give an exact figure. Residents were urged not to travel in the area. </p><p>It is difficult to assess the damage to homes, roads and other infrastructure as rescuers struggle to reach some affected areas, but it is clear that it is extensive. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents walk along a mud-covered highway following heavy rainfall in Valencia province.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Miguel Angel Polo/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Videos showed some bridges were washed away, and dozens of roads were left impassable, according to Spain’s traffic authority.

Damage to roads and bridges left rescuers struggling to reach some areas, officials said.</p><p>There were also concerns that the disaster could seriously affect agriculture in a region that is a major producer of fruits and vegetables, including Valencia’s famous oranges.</p><p>José Bautista<!-- -->and <!-- -->Raymond Zhong<!-- -->contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
