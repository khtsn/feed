Bruno Retailleau, France’s interior minister, said it will be difficult to account for all of the victims and that the government could not give a precise fatality figure at this point, Reuters reported.</p><p>The tropical cyclone had sustained wind speeds of 115 miles per hour on Sunday morning, according to the U.S. military’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center. That would make it a Category 3 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Chido made landfall in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, just south of the city of Pemba. As it pushes inland, the storm is tracking southwest and is expected to weaken significantly, according to a <a href="https://meteofrance.re/fr/cyclone" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecast</a> from the Météo-France, the official French meteorological administration.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>However, Cabo Delgado and the neighboring province of Nampula will still endure strong gusts, heavy rainfall and hazardous sea conditions, the forecast said.</p><p>On Saturday, Chido passed north of Madagascar and hit Mayotte, a French island territory about 500 miles east of Mozambique. French officials said that the storm caused extensive damage to an airport and other infrastructure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="chido-map-path-embed" data-id="100000009868384" data-source-id="100000009868384"><div slug="chido-map-path-embed" data-sourceid="100000009868384" id="embed-id-100000009868384">
