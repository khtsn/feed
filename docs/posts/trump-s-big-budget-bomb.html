President Joe Biden’s signature proposal was Build Back Better. Now President Trump has yoked his presidency — yoked all of us — to his [CLIP] Big, beautiful — that gorgeous, big, beautiful bill. Let me suggest another name for it. I’ll even stay on trend. The Big Budget Bomb. I’m recording this on Wednesday, May 21. It’s always possible things will change. [CLIP] It is Thursday, May 22. It is 7:01 on the East Coast, and we’ve got breaking news. Moments ago, the House just passed President Trump’s big, beautiful bill. [CLIP] The bill is passed. [CLIP] President Trump with this reaction: “Now it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work and send the bill to my desk as soon as possible!” But as of right now, the damage this thing will do to the budget if it detonates is hard to properly convey, in part because the size of this thing is hard to properly convey. And the budget, to be honest, is only where the problems this bill would cause begin. When you’re thinking about the size and cost of legislation, you’ve got two different sides to keep in mind: how much the bill costs, either through new spending or tax cuts, and how much of that cost is paid for versus added to the debt. The Inflation Reduction Act was expected to cost about $500 billion over 10 years, and it paid for that spending — and more — through tax increases. The Affordable Care Act was expected to cost about $1 trillion over 10 years — all of that, again, paid for. Trump’s 2017 tax reform bill, when you added everything up, left an estimated $1.5 trillion of tax cuts unpaid for. The Big Budget Bomb exists in a class unto itself. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which I think nowadays is Washington’s saddest advocacy group, if you take seriously the permanence the Republicans are actually seeking, the Big Budget Bomb will add about $5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. $5 trillion. That is an insane number. You remember when Trump promised to balance the budget? [CLIP] I want to do what has not been done in 24 years. Balance the federal budget. We’re going to balance it. I also remember that. That happened in March. I’ve been talking about what the bill does to the budget. But here’s what this bill does in the real world. It cuts taxes, mostly for richer people. It cuts Medicaid and food stamps. Republicans are also allowing some Obamacare subsidies to expire. And so the estimate is that between all this, 13 million people — 13 million — will lose health insurance. It’s also grimly exact. The bill has $1.1 trillion in tax cuts for people who make more than $500,000 a year. And it has $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. It is a straight transfer from people who cannot afford food and medical care to people who can afford to fly first class. The bill also guts the tax credits that support the wind, solar, electric vehicle and nuclear power industries. China will be thrilled by that. When you think about this bill, you should think about risk. This bill increases our risk of a fiscal crisis. What if all these other countries were alienating, all these investors we’ve been scaring stop buying our debt — even as we are creating trillions more in debt we’re going to need them to buy? This bill increases the risk any of us face if we can’t afford health care or food for our families. If Trump’s tariffs cause a recession, this bill has gutted the safety net millions of us would have relied on for help. It pumps tens of billions of dollars into ICE detention facilities and deportation capacity. So it raises a risk faced by immigrants or anyone else caught up in the administration’s mass deportation and detention operations. Look, I’ve been a policy journalist for more than 20 years. I’ve covered more bills than I can count. I cannot remember a crueler or more irresponsible piece of domestic legislation that has been seriously proposed. And its sins are compounded by its size. If the Republicans’ Big Budget Bomb goes off, we are all in the blast radius.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/23/opinion/23eks-bbb-image2/23eks-bbb-image2-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">We are all in the blast radius of Trump’s tax-cut bill.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-1"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>Trump’s Big Budget Bomb</h3><p><span>We are all in the blast radius of Trump’s tax-cut bill.

I’ll even stay on trend: the Big Budget Bomb.</p><p>I’m recording this on Wednesday, May 21. It’s always possible things will change. But as of right now, the damage this bill will do to the budget if it detonates is hard to properly convey — in part because the size of this thing is hard to properly convey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And the budget, to be honest, is where the problems this bill would cause only begin. But we have to start somewhere.</p><p>When you’re thinking about the size and cost of legislation, you have to keep in mind two different sides: how much the bill costs, either through new spending or tax cuts, and how much of that cost is paid for — versus added to — the debt.</p><p>The Inflation Reduction Act was expected to cost about $500 billion over 10 years, and it paid for all that spending — and more — through tax increases. The Affordable Care Act was expected to cost about a trillion dollars over 10 years — all of it, again, paid for. Trump’s 2017 tax reform bill, when you added everything up, left an estimated $1.5 trillion of tax cuts unpaid.</p><p>But the Big Budget Bomb exists in a class by itself. Even a naive analysis, one that buys into some very obvious Republican budget tricks, finds that this bill, as it exists on May 21, cuts taxes and raises spending by more than $4 trillion over 10 years — but only pays for about $1.5 trillion of that.</p><p>Once you add interest on all that new debt — and we’re paying really high interest rates on that nowadays — the Budget Bomb puts more than $3 trillion on the national credit card over the next decade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But let’s not fall for dumb budget tricks. The bill is full of tax cuts the Republicans have slapped expiration dates on. The way it’s written right now, it wipes out taxes on overtime and tips and car loans, but only for four years. That will all expire in 2028. But we know they have no intention of allowing those tax cuts to expire. They want to run in 2028 on the fear that Democrats will let them expire.</p><p>Republicans use this trick a lot. If you look back at those 2017 tax cuts from Donald Trump’s first term, they used the same gimmick. And in this very bill, Republicans are canceling all those expiration dates.</p><p>I’d used the old “Fool me once” line, but I wasn’t fooled on this last time, and I’m not going to pretend to be fooled on it this time. But I do think it’s at least a little bit funny that the Republicans want budgetary credit for using that expiring tax-cut trick in the very same bill in which they’re also deleting their last set of expiration dates. One thing you’ll never hear me say about Donald Trump’s Republican Party is that it lacks chutzpah.</p><p>According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — Washington’s saddest advocacy group — if you take seriously the permanence the Republicans are actually seeking, the Big Budget Bomb will add about $5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. That is an insane number.</p><p>Do you remember when Trump promised to balance the budget?</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Archived clip of Trump:</em></strong><em> I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget. We’re going to balance it.</em></p></blockquote><p>That happened in March. So here I’ve been talking about what the bill does to the budget. But there’s this other question, too — maybe the more important one: What is it trying to accomplish?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Five trillion dollars is a lot of debt, but if it would lead us to invent commercialized nuclear fusion or perfect a drug that would double our healthy life span, then fine. It’s worth it.</p><p>But here’s what this bill does in the real world: It cuts taxes mostly for richer people. It cuts Medicaid and food stamps. Republicans are also allowing some Obamacare subsidies to expire, and so the estimate is that between all this, 13 million people will lose health insurance.</p><p>It’s also grimly exact.

If the Republicans’ Big Budget Bomb goes off, we are all in the blast radius.</p><p>My guest today is Catherine Rampell. She’s an economics columnist at The Washington Post and an anchor at MSNBC who has been covering this closely. So I asked her to come on the show to help talk through all the different risks this bill brings — and what it will really mean for people’s lives.</p><p><strong>Ezra Klein: Catherine Rampell, welcome to the show.</strong></p><p><strong>Catherine Rampell:</strong> Great to join you.</p><p><strong>So this big, beautiful bill — big, beautiful budget — it is really quite big. There’s a lot in it. If you could only tell people about three or four of its parts, what would they be?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>I think I would say it is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, from the young to the old and from the future to the past.</p><p><strong>Walk me through that.</strong></p><p>It has a lot of big bundles of parts in it, which normally we would have more time to digest piecemeal, but those include big tax cuts, which are generally quite regressive. They help higher income people more.</p><p>It also includes big cuts to the safety net, particularly Medicaid and SNAP, otherwise known as food stamps. And it basically eliminates a bunch of climate-related tax credits, which are investments in the future, as well as cuts programs that disproportionately help children — which I would also say robs our future and will still cost a lot of money, leaving the bill due to future generations of taxpayers.</p><p><strong>And how big is that bill?</strong></p><p>Depends on how you calculate it. There are a bunch of competing estimates out there, but over 10 years, it’s somewhere around $4 trillion. And before the negotiations are done, it may well be more than that because there are a bunch of Republicans who want even more tax cuts.</p><p><strong>You and I are both battle-scarred veterans of the 2010 budget fights.</strong></p><p>[Chuckles.] Oh, yes, oh, yes.</p><p><strong>I think those fights — when we were constantly being told by Republicans that we were about to become Greece and needed immediate austerity, and then, in fact, interest rates were completely fine for years and years — soured a lot of people on warnings about the debt. But we’re in a pretty different interest rate environment now. Interest rates are a lot higher.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>And the payments have gotten pretty serious. Interest payments are currently the second highest expenditure in the federal budget. It’s more than our entire national defense spending.</strong></p><p><strong>Adding a bunch more debt on top of that seems a little dangerous. How do you think about the debt burden we’re facing down here?</strong></p><p>What’s that expression? “Something that can’t go on forever, won’t”?</p><p>I think that’s where we are, in that we cannot continue to sustain this level of deficit spending without at some point, you would think, bond investors revolting and our political leaders needing to either cut spending or raise taxes or both.</p><p>But when that actually happens, I have no idea. Trump is doing other things to call into question the safety or risk-freeness of the U.S. dollar and U.S. debt. So setting that aside —</p><p><strong>This is what worries me. I’m used to doing budget coverage, and you tend to sit in the confines of the budget — you’re worried about this provision and that provision.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>But there’s this interaction effect between what Trump is doing elsewhere — the tariffs, the trade war with China. We have seen bond markets shake recently under various fears and then piling on a huge amount of new debt in this budget, if it passes.</strong></p><p><strong>And we have this world where we have much higher interest rates. I think the Trump administration would like to see interest rates come down.</strong></p><p>Oh, Trump has made that more than clear.</p><p><strong>More than clear. But passing a budget like this makes it a lot harder for the Fed to bring down interest rates.</strong></p><p>Yes. Well, a lot of things that the Trump administration is doing will make it harder to reduce interest rates, one of which is adding a lot more debt, piled onto the existing debt that we already have. Some of it has to do with the fact that tariffs are likely to increase prices.</p><p>All of these things are coming together to make it more likely that rates either go up or at least don’t come down as much as certainly anyone looking for a house would like them to be.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong>I know this all gets wonky to try to plug the weird and quite, I think, dangerous budget into the other parts of the Trump administration’s economic theory, but I want to try to do it for a minute.</strong></p><p><strong>We’ve just spent months covering the tariffs and the theory behind the tariffs. On some level, the theory behind the tariffs is that trade deficits are bad. And what’s happening is that the rest of the world keeps giving us money, and we keep taking in all of their investment, and that has effects on the dollar and effects on our manufacturing — and the Trump administration wants that, on some level, to stop. They believe America has been ripped off by selling so many financial products in order to buy goods.</strong></p><p>Yes. That doesn’t make any sense, though.</p><p>[Both laugh.]</p><p><strong>I agree. That’s one of the problems with this administration —</strong></p><p>It doesn’t make any sense, and I think Scott Bessent is smart enough to know that it has been to our advantage that other countries or private individuals around the world want our Treasuries, because it has enabled us to continue borrowing and borrowing and borrowing and to not have to make the politically difficult decisions to either raise taxes or cut benefits.</p><p>It sounds like you think that the administration wants people to stop buying our debt. Is that your theory of the case?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>I think that they believe that this world — in which our financial products are so unbelievably attractive and we are buying so much from the rest of the world and giving them our money, and they take our debt — that is a bad world. The Trump administration wants to shift the balance of trade and inflows and outflows.</strong></p><p><strong>And that’s what the tariffs are largely about — and that they’re doing this at this moment when they’re going to pile on a bunch of debt.</strong></p><p>I think what’s happening here is that Trump decided he likes tariffs, and everybody around him scrambles to reverse-engineer a justification for it.</p><p><strong>Oh, that I don’t disagree with.</strong></p><p>I don’t think that anybody is thinking: Yes, we need to have more tariffs in order to have more manufacturing, in order to have the rest of the world not buying our debt.</p><p>Because everything Trump wants to do will increase the debt.</p><p><strong>So I am not arguing. There’s no contradiction. What I’m saying is they’re doing both of these things. They’re putting out a bunch of tariffs —</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>And they’re making us a less trustworthy place to invest. And, on the other hand, they’re going to radically increase our debt, and they need to have the world keep buying it.</strong></p><p><strong>These things together — making America a less welcoming place for that endless purchasing of our debt and making America a less trustworthy place to purchase debt and making America a place that needs to sell ever more debt — seems like a recipe for things to go very badly wrong at some unknown point in the future. That is where I’m going with all this.</strong></p><p>Absolutely — yes. I 100 percent agree with all of that.</p><p>But I don’t think that any of this is deliberate. I think Trump is convinced that the bill won’t cost anything. People like Scott Bessent have told him it’s going to supercharge growth and that we’ll grow our way out of debt — and then we don’t have to worry about whether there’s appetite out there to buy more Treasuries.</p><p><strong>Do you buy that the taxes we’re seeing in this bill will lead to a lot of growth we would not have otherwise had?</strong></p><p>I think that it will stimulate demand somewhat in the near term. If people’s taxes go down, they have more money to spend on other things. We saw that last time. So there will be some supply side effects, some demand side effects — but not enough to overcome all of the other reasons this is slowing the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>I was talking with this guy who was the chief executive officer of a Christmas tree company, Balsam Hill. They sell artificial Christmas trees from China.</p><p>And I asked: So Trump says he’s going to help you in the long run by cutting your taxes. And he said: We ran the numbers, and if they cut the taxes on their profits by half, that would offset at a 2 percent increase in tariffs.</p><p>The numbers just don’t add up, particularly for industries that are really exposed to the tariffs. But in general, for the macroeconomy — no. These things are not going to fully pay for themselves, even if there is a tiny grain of truth to the idea that they could stimulate the economy, at least in the near term.</p><p>Again, I think in some ways it sounds like you’re giving them too much credit. I don’t think it’s as strategic as you make it out to be, but the bad outcome you described —</p><p><strong>I don’t hugely care what they think they’re doing.</strong></p><p>[Laughs.] OK. Fair enough.</p><p><strong>I care what they’re doing.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>I agree that all of their different arguments for things are contradictory and don’t cross domains, that there’s no macro theory of the case. But they are doing all of these things, and that seems to me like a huge risk that is building up beneath the system.</strong></p><p>I agree with that. And this Moody’s announcement, I think is —</p><p><strong>Yes. Do you want to describe what happened there?</strong></p><p>So there are basically three main ratings agencies. For a very, very long time, the U.S. debt was rated by all of them as pristine, risk-free, gold stars all around — triple A is what they called it. Then, over the last 10 to 15 years, ratings agencies started knocking us down a peg and saying: Maybe they’re not as good for their word as they seem to be — including because there was a debt-ceiling debacle where it looked like we might default on our debt, etc.</p><p>More recently, the last holdout, Moody’s — which I think had not downgraded us in more than 100 years or we’ve had a perfect rating from them for more than 100 years — said: Yes, we don’t think these guys are quite as 100 percent good for their money as we once thought. Because the U.S. deficits have already been on track to be growing and growing and growing, and now with the likely passage of this additional “big, beautiful bill,” that problem is only going to get worse.</p><p>It doesn’t really mean anything, per se. It’s more symbolic — like yet another scolding from the financial markets, in a way, that lawmakers are acting irresponsibly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p><strong>So when you add a bunch of debt, it matters what you’re adding the debt for. In this case, we’re adding it to extend the tax cuts passed in 2017 — and then adding a bunch of new tax cuts on top of it.</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>How do you describe the total tax cut package? What is it trying to do? Who is it benefiting? What’s your gloss on it?</strong></p><p>Overall, most Americans will get a tax cut — relative to what they would have had if no bill had passed, because a lot of the tax code is expiring and people’s taxes would have otherwise gone up. When you hear talking points like: These are only tax cuts for billionaires or corporations or whatever — that’s not quite true. I looked this up before we met, but basically 94 percent of Americans will get some tax cut relative to what would have happened if Congress does nothing.</p><p>But the very biggest benefits definitely go to higher income classes. This is from the Tax Policy Center: Two-thirds of the plan’s tax cuts by dollar value go to those in the top quintile. People in the top 1 percent would get about a quarter of the tax cuts. So that’s people making over $1 million basically — they get about a quarter of the benefits.</p><p>Then if you look at the overall bill, it’s not only that the rich will benefit more, it’s that the poor come out behind. Because, to the extent that any of this is paid for at all, it’s largely paid for by taking other benefits away from low-income people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p><strong>Like what benefits?</strong></p><p>Medicaid and food stamps are the biggies here. Medicaid currently enrolls something like one in five Americans. It’s a huge program. It’s a popular program.</p><p>Republicans have argued that their changes are only about kicking off the “freeloaders” and apocryphal “welfare queens” and will make sure that everyone who is deserving of this public health insurance program continues to receive it. But if you actually look at the provisions themselves, that seems very unlikely.</p><p><strong>I want to stay on the Medicaid side of this for a minute. One of the big ways they’re trying to save money in Medicaid — without saying that what they’re doing is cutting it — is what’s called work requirements.</strong></p><p><strong>The theory of work requirements would make you prove, if you’re an able-bodied person, that you have worked more than 80 hours or that you are looking for work in some intense way. And if you can’t prove that, you lose your Medicaid because, if you’re going to get the benefit of Medicaid, you should show the responsibility of either working or looking for work.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem is — and my partner Annie Lowrey has talked about this as the “time tax” and written about this kind of administrative complexity a lot — we make it so hard to do and to prove that huge numbers of people lose coverage through being unable to complete the paperwork. So you’re weaponizing time and bureaucratic complexity to deny people a benefit they are supposed to have.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p><strong>How much of the Medicaid cut is built around that?</strong></p><p>A lot of it. I actually did a lot of on-the-ground reporting about a pilot version of this back in 2018 or 2019 in Arkansas, where the Trump administration allowed Arkansas to impose work requirements.</p><p>I’ll say a few things. The first thing is this is actually a very popular provision. Something like 62 percent of Americans like the idea of Medicaid work requirements, including about half of Democrats, because it sounds reasonable. Why shouldn’t people have to show that they are productive members of society in order to receive these government benefits? But it’s not really clear what problem it’s trying to solve.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of people who are on Medicaid are working, either part-time or full-time. The remainder who are not working have something that is generally considered an allowable excuse, meaning that they’re a full-time caregiver, they’re enrolled in school, they have a disability, etc. It’s only a very tiny slice of people who don’t have one of these exclusions, one of these exemptions that’s spelled out.</p><p>In Arkansas, something like 18,000 people lost their Medicaid within the span of a few months. Most of those people were kicked off Medicaid — not because they were shown to have not been working or to have one of these other allowable exemptions but for administrative reasons. Basically, they didn’t fill out the paperwork or they didn’t fill it out sufficiently.</p><p>There was one guy that I profiled, Adrian McGonigal, who actually was working at a chicken plant. He got confused about how to report his hours. It was not mobile friendly. The website literally shut down after about nine o’clock every day. I don’t know — the hamsters had to go to bed or something.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p><strong>[Chuckles.]</strong></p><p>And he didn’t have access to a computer. He only had his phone. He thought he did it once and that it was sufficient.</p><p>He lost his health coverage. He had severe C.O.P.D., and because he was not able to get his medications and to treat this chronic illness, he ended up getting very sick and lost his job at the chicken plant. So this policy that was sold as encouraging people to get jobs actually cost him his.</p><p>I learned that he, unfortunately, passed away. I got in touch with his former Legal Aid attorney who said that ultimately, Adrian had been one of the plaintiffs in the case to challenge this law and did get it overturned. And he was able to get his Medicaid back — but he kind of went into this downward financial and health spiral as a result of all of this.</p><p>So these things have consequences. There are long-term harms that are created by what seems like reasonable paperwork to some people. But the reality is that this is a back doorway of basically purging people from their health insurance.</p><p>Again, to take it back to the Congressional Budget Office: That is their assumption, as well. The Congressional Budget Office says: Yes, this will save a lot of money, and a lot of people will lose health insurance. There will be no change on employment. That is what their assumption is. This policy that, again, is supposed to be about making sure only the deserving people get jobs and encouraging more people to pick themselves up by their own bootstraps will actually have no effect on how many people have jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p><strong>That’s pretty grim.</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>And it saves a lot of their money actually, which implies that a lot of people are losing coverage through these paperwork requirements.</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>I just think this is ugly. If you want to argue that people shouldn’t have health care, fine. If you want to argue that people should have jobs, we could have all kinds of labor-market policies that help people get jobs —</strong></p><p>None of which are in this bill.</p><p><strong>None of which are in this bill. But for the administration that did DOGE to add a huge layer of bureaucratic complexity — how good will the other languages of this paperwork be? How quick will the response times of these agencies be?</strong></p><p>Well, the website shut down after 9 p.m. —</p><p><strong>The website shut down after 9 p.m.</strong></p><p><strong>It just really reveals something. Both an unwillingness to stand up for what they’re actually doing — I mean, Trump has promised to not cut Medicaid — and then an effort to weaponize the very bureaucratic inefficiency that they otherwise pretend to condemn and root out — against the weakest and most powerless segment of society: people who do not make enough money to get health insurance. The whole thing actually turns my stomach.</strong></p><p>Yes. There’s a bunch of other red tape that they add. They require that people on Medicaid have to reprove eligibility more frequently — which again, if the process were completely seamless, who cares? But it’s not. Every time people have to reprove eligibility, even if nothing has changed in their situation, there’s a chance the paperwork gets lost and people have to find the time to go to the office to deliver the forms in person or they have to navigate this clunky website.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>It’s a matter of hacking through all of this red tape, American Ninja-style. That’s how I picture it. It’s an obstacle course, essentially, that they’ve set up for people to make it harder for them to prove that they are entitled to the benefits that they are legally entitled to.</p><p><strong>Then there are about $300 billion in cuts to SNAP, which is the modern term for the food stamps program. And a lot of this bill is about extending tax cuts from the past. But right now there are these subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that were passed under the Biden administration, which have made the premiums in the Affordable Care Act much cheaper. They’ve led to a pretty big increase in the number of people enrolled.</strong></p><p><strong>One of the pay fors in the bill is to allow those subsidies to expire. Do you mind talking about how that will work?</strong></p><p>Yes. Understandably, there’s been a lot of focus on Medicaid. There are other provisions — either in the bill or as part of the broader Republican agenda — that will also end up with people losing their health insurance.</p><p>There are these expanded subsidies essentially for people to buy insurance on the individual marketplace that have been partly responsible for the fact that the uninsured rate in America, I think, was at its lowest level on record last year. It’s partly because of Medicaid expansion and partly because of this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>It’s technical and wonky and people don’t really pay attention to it, but those expanded subsidies were passed by Democrats and are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans could choose to extend those, just as they’re extending a lot of other things on the tax side —</p><p><strong>And pretending that extension costs no money.</strong></p><p>Correct. But they have chosen not to. So when you see these scarier figures from the C.B.O. for how many people are going to become newly uninsured — over 13 million people — that is inclusive of Medicaid, changes to the Affordable Care Act and some other regulatory stuff that Congress is codifying.</p><p><strong>So I just want to put a very fine point on this. According to our best read of what the bill is going to do, we are going to drive 13 million people off health insurance. We are going to end $300 billion of spending that gives food to hungry people. And that is going to pay for — depending on how you calculate it — roughly a quarter of tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. That’s the fundamental math of this bill.</strong></p><p>Yes, that is the fundamental math of this bill. And this is part of the reason I, among others, have characterized it as a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, because it is forcing low-income people who would otherwise have access to these safety net benefits that have been around and been popular for many decades —</p><p><strong>Including among Republicans, as Senator Josh Hawley has been saying.</strong></p><p>Yes. Just as an aside: There are Republicans in the House who very narrowly won their elections last year by fewer votes than the number of people who are on Medicaid in their districts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>Besides the human cost of all of this, politically it seems pretty dumb to me because while there is maybe a stereotype of the typical food stamp recipient or the typical Medicaid recipient — a stereotype that’s racialized among other things — people from all walks of life go through periods where they need this assistance.</p><p>Many of them are Republicans. Many of them live in districts that are currently represented by Republicans. And at some point, people are going to notice when they can’t put food on the table or they can’t get the inhaler for their kid.</p><p><strong>It used to be the case in American politics that Democrats won voters who made less than $50,000 by a lot, and Republicans won voters who made more than $100,000 by a lot. We used to have these fights over the safety net, but they somewhat aligned with the political coalitions. Republicans wanted to cut benefits like this, but mostly those were not their voters.</strong></p><p><strong>In 2024, Donald Trump won voters making less than $50,000. It wasn’t a huge victory among them, but he won them. Donald Trump won voters who did not go to college. When you look at who is on Medicaid, when you look at who is on food stamps, when you look at who needs expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, it is concentrated in this group of voters.</strong></p><p>Voters who thought Trump was going to make their cost of living cheaper —</p><p><strong>And who are also now paying higher tariffs.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>Right. There are many ways in which this administration and allies in Congress have run a pretty regressive agenda — not looking out for the common man, shall we say.</p><p>We haven’t even talked about some of the other DOGE cuts recently, like closing half of the regional Head Start offices. Head Start is the program that serves low-income families by providing pre-K and child care and other ancillary services for the parents.</p><p>My question will be: At what point do Americans necessarily connect the dots? I think with tariffs — people understand the tariffs are happening. Some of these other connections I think are a little bit more opaque. Some of that is of necessity, and some of it I think is by design.</p><p>One of my most deeply held political beliefs is that complexity rewards demagogues. This bill is definitely a case in point.</p><p>Budgets are always complicated and make people’s eyes glaze over, but normally journalists have some time to digest what’s in them and help people understand how they might affect them. Instead, all of this stuff is being dumped at once.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p>So it’s very easy to lie and say that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are just looking out for you and are going to make you rich and are going to kick off all of those freeloaders and welfare queens from programs so that you get them and they don’t. It’s an easier story to tell the more opaque the actual policies are.</p><p><strong>It’s why I’ve thought that a fight happening as we speak — and we don’t know how it will resolve yet — is interesting. The bill, as initially written, has the work requirements come into play in 2029, after the next presidential election.</strong></p><p><strong>So they get to pocket these assumed savings because we do budget numbers over 10 years. But, in theory, nobody will feel the thing they’re doing to Medicaid until 2029, or at least that thing they’re doing to Medicaid.</strong></p><p><strong>But the more right-wing members of their caucus want that brought up to 2026 — in which case, people will begin to feel it immediately within this term, such that it could be something that people are upset about come the next presidential election.</strong></p><p><strong>Again, we don’t know how it will play out, but I thought it was quite telling that the Republican majority’s preference — not their Freedom Caucus minority — was: Let’s put this in the bill but make it the next president’s problem.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p><strong>Because you can lie about things until you and a bunch of people you know are thrown off Medicaid. And then what just happened becomes clear real quickly.</strong></p><p>Yes. There’s this fundamental tension within the Republican caucus, as you pointed out, between members who think that the provisions are not heartless enough and those who think that they are too heartless, in the political sense.</p><p>The people on the budget committee who initially voted against it — I should say, when we’re recording this, we don’t know what concessions were given to them as yet in order to get the bill out of committee — they said that they wanted these Medicaid work requirements to be moved up and wanted more of the climate-related tax credits to be rescinded, etc.</p><p>But then there are a lot of other members of the party who are very worried about exactly the political risk you identified, that people will realize they’ve been kicked off these benefits and will take their anger — justified anger — out on the Republican Party and whoever is on the Republican ticket.</p><p>This is a problem not only in the House, but it’s a problem in the Senate. I think you mentioned that Josh Hawley has talked about this.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p><strong>Hawley seems to be against Medicaid cuts at high levels altogether. And he’s making the argument that I just alluded to: We are now a working class party. It is our voters on Medicaid. Cutting Medicaid for our voters.</strong></p><p>And there’s also some disagreement in the party about whether to even call these Medicaid “cuts.” [Chuckles.]</p><p><strong>Well, I think it’s not a disagreement. They don’t want to call them Medicaid cuts.</strong></p><p>Yes, fair, fair.</p><p><strong>They might play stupid, but they’re not idiots. They know they’re saving money and that when you save money on Medicaid, what just happened is somebody, somewhere, did not get health care.</strong></p><p>Right. But they are spinning it as: It’s only the undeserving people who won’t get health care. The people who are lazy, who are freeloaders, who are government parasites and can’t get their butt to work — but not you! Not you! [Chuckles.]</p><p><strong>But what Josh Hawley is saying is: Look, guys, we can’t be believing our own spin.</strong></p><p>Yes. We can’t get high on our own supply.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p><strong>If we do this, we are cutting Medicaid for our voters. And what I’m saying is, the people writing this bill know what they’re doing. They are not confused about what is happening when you cut Medicaid in this way.</strong></p><p><strong>They know that the main way this saves money is that people who otherwise could have walked into a hospital or a doctor’s office and put down a Medicaid card and gotten health care coverage that the government would have paid for cannot do that. That’s the mechanism.</strong></p><p>Yes, I agree with that. I mean, there are a lot of contradictory things about this bill.</p><p><strong>I just don’t want to allow their spin to stand on this show. That’s why. [Laughs.]</strong></p><p>Fair. That’s a totally reasonable point.</p><p>So there are members of the Republican Conference who want these Medicaid cuts to kick in faster. There are members who want them to kick in more slowly — or maybe not at all — because they understand that it is their voters who may suffer. There are members of the party who don’t want to raise deficits. There are members of the party who think that deficits don’t matter.</p><p>Part of the issue here, and part of the reason I have been really wondering where this bill actually goes, is that there are so many mutually exclusive constraints in a party that has a very thin margin that it’s hard to know who gets to extract what demands in exchange for their vote. We haven’t really talked about the Republicans who are in the SALT Caucus, who want basically bigger tax cuts for rich people by allowing people in predominantly blue states to deduct more of their state and local taxes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><div><p>It seems like the people who are worried about Medicaid cuts hurting their own constituents have gotten a little quieter recently. The SALT Caucus is now louder. So maybe they’re the ones who get to twist the bill in their direction. But then it’s going to cost even more, and what do you do about that?</p><p><strong>And be more regressive.</strong></p><p>And be more regressive. And do you end up having the bill cost more? Do you end up kicking even more people off benefits? I don’t know. These puzzle pieces just don’t fit together.</p><p><strong>I was going to say that the thing here is that the only thing holding the coalition together is fear of Donald Trump himself. House Republicans, Senate Republicans — whatever they think on most policies, very few of them will dare oppose him.</strong></p><p><strong>Except there was this one thing that happened.</strong></p><p>Oh, I know what you’re going to say.</p><p><strong>Which is that Donald Trump had exactly one good political instinct here.</strong></p><p>[Chuckles.]</p><p><strong>He said that maybe one of the ways we should pay for this is we should raise taxes on really wealthy people. And not by a ton, but maybe just enough to say we’re doing it. What happened to that?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p>This was one of the few times I’ve seen his friends and allies in Congress visibly recoil, and many of them said publicly: That’s not a good idea.</p><p>So Trump then posted on social media: Well, I think they should do it, but it’s probably a bad idea, so I kind of understand if they don’t.</p><p>This is one of the few times I feel like I’ve seen Donald Trump back down in one of these fights. It’s clear that this was in the no-fly zone.</p><p><strong>It was just interesting to see this vestigial reflex of the Republican Party — as I understood it to exist in 2013 — kick in. And the one thing Donald Trump cannot do as he tries to build his working class multiracial coalition is the most popular policy move in his arsenal for a bill like this — which is to pay for some of your tax cuts by raising taxes on rich people.</strong></p><p>Well, you said the one thing that holds the Republican Party together is fealty to Trump. I think it’s fealty to Trump and tax cuts — particularly regressive tax cuts. This has been their North Star for many, many years. And it does not surprise me that’s their one red line with this guy — that we cannot raise taxes on higher income people and corporations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p><strong>So Donald Trump wins the election running against the high prices of the Biden era, and he walks into an economy where inflation has calmed down. Things are pretty steady and stable. The stock market is in good shape.</strong></p><p><strong>Then he begins raising prices through tariffs, and the tariffs are bouncing around a lot. Right now we’re on a reduced level with China for 90 days as we negotiate something or other —</strong></p><p>Only 30 percent!</p><p><strong>A mere 30 percent. But there are tariffs now on all kinds of goods coming from all over the world. Those price increases are starting to show up — and are going to continue showing up.</strong></p><p><strong>There’s also a huge amount of uncertainty, pausing all kinds of business investment, because when you don’t know what the tariff rate or tax structure will be from day to day, you’re not going to make a bunch of long-term capital investments. So every forecaster says that the risk of recession has been rising from what they anticipated it would be at the beginning of the year.</strong></p><p><strong>Now you got a bill like this, where we’re doing things like cutting SNAP, cutting Medicaid, cutting the Affordable Care Act. How do those two things interact?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>I think it’s never really a great time to kick a lot of people off critical benefits like Medicaid and SNAP, but probably the worst time is when we are about to head into a recession. Because that’s when people are most likely to need these programs, and they automatically kick in. That’s what the safety net is, right? It’s to catch people when they might otherwise be falling, to help them get back on their feet.</p><p>These programs also, because they kick in automatically, they’re thought of as automatically stabilizing the overall economy. Because if all of these people who are losing their jobs at once stopped spending at once, that’s going to lead to a downward spiral. They stop spending, the places where they would spend their money stop hiring and lay off people, etc., etc. It’s effectively an automatic form of stimulus and helps the economy recover a little faster.</p><p>If instead you have these things coinciding at once, where we have a recession on the one hand, and these massive changes to programs like food stamps and Medicaid, then you will have not only greater suffering among individuals in the near term but potentially a deeper and longer recession.</p><p>And look, I don’t think a recession is a fait accompli. I don’t want to suggest that it’s definitely going to happen. But the odds have increased. And all of these agenda items are conspiring — whether intentionally or otherwise — to make life a lot more difficult for the most vulnerable Americans. Because again, the tariffs will also increase the prices of the things that they buy. So, yes, it’s the perfect storm.</p><p><strong>Republicans will tell you that this whole conversation is unfair, that we’re ignoring all the ways in this bill that they are expanding help for the working class.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-30"><div><p><strong>So there is a somewhat complicated approach to expanding the Child Tax Credit. There are things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. Talk to me about this set of policies, the more populist dimensions of this bill.</strong></p><p>So I don’t think they’re uniformly bad, all of the things that you just mentioned. I do think that we should be doing something to make more assistance available to families with kids, for example. But the way that they have structured these changes is still not really targeting those who need it.</p><p>As an example, the no tax on tips thing: It sounds like that would help your typical waitress or other hospitality worker. In reality, those people are probably low income enough that they’re not going to benefit from this because their income is below the threshold where they would get taxed much anyway — whether that income is coming from tips or from wages. The people who are going to benefit are going to be the people who are disproportionately high income who can maybe reclassify more of their income as tips or as overtime. So this is going to be like a big boondoggle for accountants and tax attorneys.</p><p><strong>And we’ve gutted the I.R.S., so checking on tax shenanigans is going down.</strong></p><p>Yes, right. So this is not structured in such a way that it will actually help the people that I think are being envisioned when you think about tipped workers or about people who need overtime pay. They are probably going to see very little benefit — or at least relative to where the dollars are actually going to be flowing. It’s primarily going to help higher-income people.</p><p>The same thing with eliminating taxes on Social Security. Most people under current law who are low-income already are not paying taxes on Social Security. The people who are left out of the current system and who would be exempt are disproportionately higher income because of how the law currently works. So a lot of these things that sound populist on their face are either symbolic or are actually going to be regressive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-31"><div><p>It will also distort a lot of behavior. Like, I should tell The Washington Post to just pay me 100 percent in tips and then all of my income will be tax-free.</p><p><strong>One of the other ways they’re trying to pay for part of this is gutting various tax credits to incentivize clean energy that were in the Inflation Reduction Act. This is another part of the bill under active negotiation. The right wing of the Republican Party wants to make the evisceration of these tax cuts quite complete.</strong></p><p><strong>The bill, as it is currently written, makes it profound — that’s the way I would put it: solar credits, wind credits, tax cuts for electric vehicles, nuclear, which in general, one tends to think about the Republican Party supporting.</strong></p><p><strong>Putting aside even what you think about climate change, these are fast-growing American industries, and they are industries we don’t want to lose to China. We have big tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles for a reason. Donald Trump has wanted to bring down American energy prices and wants American energy dominance. These are things that generate energy and contribute to an overall capacity.</strong></p><p><strong>How do you think about what this will mean just for the energy prices and the industries behind them?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-32"><div><p>A lot of the investments have to date been concentrated in red districts, as well. My general view on so-called clean energy, green energy — whatever term you want to use — is that the transition is coming no matter what. The economics in the long run make much more sense to electrify everything and to use solar and wind and other renewables as much as possible, because on the margin, sunshine and wind are free, and fossil fuels are not. So it’s going to win in the long run.</p><p>The question is only how quickly, and politicians can do things to either speed it up or slow it down. If they slow it down, that means we are just delaying the time until we get the really, really cheap — not to mention cleaner and more renewable — energy, effectively raising costs in the near term.</p><p><strong>But it does something else, too — which is that there is a race to have the dominant corporate players in what will be globally important export industries.</strong></p><p>That’s also true.</p><p><strong>As you say, there’s a transition going on. It’s probably going to happen one way or the other. And China — whom we are obsessed about competing with, and for reasonable reasons — has pumped a huge amount of money into trying to dominate solar technology, trying to dominate wind technology, battery technology, E.V.s.</strong></p><p><strong>So putting aside, again, what you think of renewable energy — and my opinions on it are exactly what one would think they are — this is a gigantic gift to China. Their electric vehicle industry is already quite globally competitive. We are keeping those cars out for a reason — we worry if they come in, they would beat the cars we are making.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-33"><div><p><strong>But now nobody likes Tesla in Europe. Liberals increasingly don’t like Tesla in America. And we are cutting the knees out of our other electric vehicle companies, which are using these kinds of credits to catch up. And to be really good at solar and wind and nuclear, you’ve got to fund it, and we’re going to stop doing that, too.</strong></p><p><strong>Just from their industrial policy strategy, this seems disastrous for us.</strong></p><p>Yes, I generally agree with that. I think I am more skeptical of industrial policy generally than you are. I thought that the tariffs we placed on not just Chinese solar but global solar back in about 2018 and that were then extended under Biden — I thought those were dumb. If other countries want to sell us solar on the cheap, let them. Let us have cheap clean energy!</p><p><strong>We don’t disagree on this.</strong></p><p>OK. And I agree with you that this set of policies is, again, somewhat at odds with Trump’s general pro-manufacturing renaissance agenda. Why are we talking about bringing back sneaker factories and doll factories? Like, very low-value items.</p><p>If we are going to use industrial policy to try to revive or invest in some segment of the manufacturing industry, we should be doing it for the goods of the future.</p><p><strong>So this gets to another form of redistribution that you brought up at the beginning, and that I wanted to end on, which is the redistribution from the young to the old.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-34"><div><p><strong>There’s a way that the climate side does this very directly. If we are slowing down that transition, slowing down emissions curbs, people who are younger and are going to live in a more volatile climate are going to experience more harm from that.</strong></p><p><strong>But you’re making a bigger point about the bill. The bill from an administration that prides itself on being pronatalist and being pro-kids and wanting to see more kids in America.</strong></p><p><strong>Walk me through that form of redistribution.</strong></p><p>So there are a number of ways in which babies and kids are basically getting shafted. One is — again, where we started out, talking about who pays back the debt. At some point this debt will have to be repaid by future generations of Americans, either in the form of higher taxes or fewer benefits. So that’s going to be today’s kids. That’s a very basic point.</p><p>We are also doing a bunch of things to disinvest in their health care and their nutritional development by taking away some of these critical safety net benefits that do have a payoff over the long run.</p><p>And then there are other random things in the bill that seem to be bizarrely exacting cruelty upon kids for no apparent reason. This is really in the weeds, but federal Medicaid dollars cannot be used to pay for undocumented people. Some states will use their own funds to provide health insurance to children regardless of immigration status.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-35"><div><p>The bill says if you use your own funds to pay for these kids, then we are going to strip away all of this other money. So they’re basically incentivizing states to take health insurance away from children.</p><p>The Child Tax Credit is another good example of this. Again, it’s buried in the bill; probably very few people realize it’s there.</p><p>Even though they say they’re making it more generous, it’s basically for higher income people, and they are taking it away from a lot of children. The way that they’re doing that is by saying if either of a child’s parents doesn’t have a Social Security number, the child is not eligible for the Child Tax Credit.</p><p>This does not only affect kids who might have an undocumented parent, it also affects kids who might have one parent who’s here legally, too. Like, if you’re on a student visa, you generally can’t get a Social Security number. So if you imagine a U.S. citizen has a kid with somebody who is in their grad school class, their child will not be eligible for the Child Tax Credit, whereas in the past they would have been.</p><p>There’s also a marriage penalty built into all of this. If the parents in that example don’t get married, then the U.S. citizen parent can claim the kid and get the credit. But if they get married, they lose it altogether.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-36"><div><p>There’s a bunch of little things in the bill that basically take a lot of resources away from kids, in some ways big and small, especially children of immigrants. But not only children of immigrants. Cost shifting more of food stamps onto the states — that will disproportionately hurt kids because kids make up a huge chunk of the food stamp-receiving population. So there are a bunch of things like that, and I think that gets lost in all of this.</p><p><strong>I think that’s important, though, because if you also look at where the bill spends new money, one of the places that it spends new money is inflicting pain and accelerating deportation among immigrants.</strong></p><p><strong>So there’s $45 billion through 2029 for ICE detention facilities — it’s a 365 percent increase annually from where it is now; $14 billion through 2029 for ICE transportation and removal operations — a 500 percent increase. So you’re seeing them as they cut Medicaid, as they cut the Affordable Care Act, as they cut green energy subsidies. And they’re spending a bunch of money on funding the machines and architecture for deportation, for detainment, and — if you begin thinking about other things you’ve heard from Stephen Miller about suspending due process — for things that could get very scary.</strong></p><p><strong>It has been a complaint of the administration that they don’t have the resources to do mass deportation and confinement right now. This bill is meant to give them that money.</strong></p><p>Yes. And look, this is a very scary expansion of the detention industrial complex.</p><p>One piece of all of this that I do want to make sure I emphasize is that Trump says he’s going after gangbangers and criminals and drug dealers and whatever, and those are the people who are getting locked up, with this image conjured up that these are people living in the shadows, committing crimes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-37"><div><p>He’s actually been trying to deport a lot of people who have — or had, I should say — permission to be here. He is basically de-documenting people to create a larger illegal or unauthorized population by taking away legal status or various kinds of temporary legal status that people have. He has stripped Afghans, Venezuelans and a lot of other populations of the protections that they had against deportation — their ability to be here legally, to work legally.</p><p>He is basically manifesting this scary fantasy that he had been portraying for many years: that we are being overrun with people who are not allowed to be here. And he’s now saying: No, you’ve now broken the law. But he basically forced them to break the law by taking away their protections.</p><p><strong>I think this gets to this bigger picture we’ve been tracking during this conversation. Budgets are a way we make certain goals possible to achieve and other goals impossible to achieve.</strong></p><p>They’re statements of our values.</p><p><strong>So tax cuts for people in general — rich people, in particular: Definitely, check. Protecting Medicaid and health care for working class people, which you have heard them talk about: Nope, Medicaid is getting gutted. This whole: We’re a working class coalition now — not so much.</strong></p><p><strong>Keeping prices down between the tariffs and how much more people will pay as we shift health insurance costs onto them and off the government: We’re not keeping prices down. Cutting budget deficits, which people around Trump have talked a lot about how unsustainable our fiscal picture is: This bill is a disaster.</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-38"><div><p><strong>But the Stephen Miller mass deportation agenda, the immigration side of this administration and its promises — that is really getting served here. The promises we’re keeping here are tax cuts tilted toward rich people and building a huge engine, funding a huge machinery of de-documentation — as you, I think correctly put it — deportation to detention. Those are our values, I guess. That’s the budget.</strong></p><p>Those are our values. I wish they were more clearly communicated to the public. But the fact that this bill has come together so quickly — it’s more than 1,000 pages long — should tell you how much they actually want the public to learn about what is in this agenda.</p><p><strong>I think that’s a good place to end. Always our final question: What are three books you’d recommend to the audience?</strong></p><p>OK, so I was thinking about the right three to recommend, and I’m going to give you three very different titles.</p><p>Currently, I am reading Ken Rogoff’s book “Our Dollar, Your Problem,” which has a sweeping history of how the dollar became the global reserve currency and how much of that was about luck and whether that will persist. I haven’t finished it yet, but I’m really enjoying it right now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-39"><div><p>My second recommendation would be “Demon Copperhead” by Barbara Kingsolver, which came out a couple of years ago and I think won the Pulitzer. It’s a beautiful novel that’s loosely based on — or an update of — “David Copperfield.” Besides being extraordinarily written, it has some tremendous political insights in it, as well. Have you read it?</p><p><strong>I have, and she’s been on the show, and it’s a great episode, if people want to go back and look it up.</strong></p><p>It’s about resentment among — she doesn’t describe them as Trump voters in her book, but some of them could be recognizable as the “Trump voter in the diner” archetype.</p><p>My third recommendation is going to be “Shy,” which is the memoir of musical composer Mary Rodgers, published posthumously with Jesse Green, who is the theater critic here at The Times.</p><p>People who know me well know that I’m a big theater nerd, and I loved this book. It’s very dishy. There’s a lot in it about mid-20th-century gossip from Broadway and how she dated Stephen Sondheim — who was not known for being attracted to women — and how all of that went. It’s just a delightful, delightful, gossipy memoir. So I definitely recommend that.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-41"><div><p>This episode of “The Ezra Klein Show” was produced by Rollin Hu.
