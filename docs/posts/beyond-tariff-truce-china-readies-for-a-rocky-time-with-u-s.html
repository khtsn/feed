For China, that means its search for economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia is unlikely to soften its tough line on its regional territorial claims and military competition.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/china-us-tariffs.html" title="">Both sides have agreed</a> to temporarily<strong> </strong>cut the startlingly high tariffs they had imposed on each other’s goods. But the tariff truce will not allay other grievances that Beijing has with Washington, such as over a Pentagon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/hegseth-philippines-china.html" title="">vow</a> to shift military forces to Asia and the Pacific, and the continuing efforts to limit China’s access to advanced technology.</p><p>The climb-down on tariffs may open the way to a call, and a summit, between President Trump and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping. But Mr. Trump’s high tariffs have already weakened guarded hopes in Beijing that Mr. Xi could appeal to Mr. Trump’s deal-maker side, said experts who have spoken to Chinese officials and policy advisers. While Beijing will vigorously pursue opportunities in talks with the Trump administration, it will steel for a possible flare-up of tensions — repeating the pattern of relations during Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>“I think it validates Beijing’s view that it was correct to take a dark view of U.S. intentions — and prepare for the eventuality of a second trade war with the policies it has pursued in the years since the first trade war” during Mr. Trump’s first term, said <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/jonathan-a-czin/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Czin</a>, the Michael H. Armacost Chair in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, who formerly worked in the Central Intelligence Agency analyzing Chinese politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“My suspicion is that Beijing sees this as a tactical retreat by the U.S. rather than a more fundamental shift away from hostility toward the Chinese Communist Party,&#34; Mr. Czin said of the tariff pause agreed in Geneva.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump announcing reciprocal tariffs at the White House last month.

China <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202505/05/WS681807c2a310a04af22bd777.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it was responding</a> to a provocative flight over the islands by a Japanese plane.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>U.S. and Philippine troops during joint military exercises in Aparri, Philippines, this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ezra Acayan/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>This month, too, China’s Coast Guard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/asia/south-china-philippine-sandy.html" title="">landed on Sandy Cay</a>, a sliver of sand in the disputed South China Sea that is also claimed by the Philippines. Their action came days before the United States and the Philippines began annual <a href="https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/04/philippines-and-u-s-kick-off-balikatan-2025-large-scale-exercise/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint military exercises</a> in the Philippines.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Above all, the Chinese government remains on edge over Taiwan, the democratically governed island that Beijing claims as its territory. In early April, the People’s Liberation Army held <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/asia/china-taiwan-military-drills.html" title="">exercises around Taiwan</a> to practice imposing a blockade.</p><p>China’s leaders saw no contradiction in their mix of sweet talk and hardball actions, said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior China policy official at the White House and State Department during the Biden administration.</p><p>“They believe it is precisely the moment to set the relationship with China’s neighbors — particularly those that they worry have grown too close with Washington — on more advantageous terms,” Mr. Gewirtz said. “It is a moment when they believe those states’ ability to push back is diminished and where China’s leaders can say ‘We can, yes, offer economic and technology deals and other incentives. But we also can continue to push on our territorial claims.’ And those two things coexist very comfortably in their minds.”</p><p>Rifts have opened up between the United States and many traditional allies, especially in Europe. But so far, Mr. Trump’s policies have not shaken traditional U.S. alliances in Asia and the Pacific to the same degree. Marco Rubio attended a <a href="https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/joint-statement-by-the-quad-foreign-ministers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting with foreign ministers</a> from India, Japan and Australia on his first full day as Secretary of State. Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan issued a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/02/united-states-japan-joint-leaders-statement/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint statement</a> that mentioned their shared concerns about Chinese threats to Taiwan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A public screen broadcasting news about China’s military drills around Taiwan, in Beijing, China, last month.

And in Mr. Trump’s first term, shows of bonhomie between him and Mr. Xi gave way to a trade war, then an agreement that faltered, with Washington accusing China of not honoring its side of the bargain. There was also acrimony over the origins of Covid, U.S. controls on technology exports, and each sides’ military aims.</p><p>This time, the mutual back down on tariffs will not dispel deep distrust between China and the United States, said Shen Dingli, a scholar of international relations in Shanghai. If both sides keep dialing back on their trade disputes, relations may improve for a year or two, but then are likely to worsen again, Mr. Shen said, “because we have too many points of disagreement.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Library of Congress Standoff:</strong> The president named Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general and the president’s former personal lawyer, as the acting librarian.
