But the financial strain of pandemic shutdowns and rising prices were the death knell to many local businesses.</p><p>Mr. Khan greets every guest at Panna II, answers every phone call and serves the tables alongside his wait staff.

In the late 1960s, immigrants largely from the Sylhet region in what is now Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) started moving to New York — one by one, family members, cousins and neighbors following one another to an area that was still considered part of the Lower East Side.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>They opened new restaurants, serving North Indian fare (biryani, saag) instead of Bengali food (which includes more seafood) because it was more recognizable to the neighborhood’s countercultural community. They turned the block into a little Sylhet, under the guise of Indian cuisine. Soon enough, the neighborhood’s hippies and artists, longstanding Ukrainian, Jewish and Puerto Rican communities, and new Bangladeshi residents came together in what was becoming the East Village.</p><p>By the late ’80s, nearly every vendor and restaurant on the block sold curries and rotis.</p><p>When Suketu Mehta was a student at N.Y.U. in the ’80s, he often dined at Milon. Mr. Mehta, now an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/books/review/suketu-mehta-this-land-is-our-land.html" title="">author</a> and associate professor of journalism at N.Y.U. focused on migration and cities, called the restaurants a “service to people who were living in the village at the time who weren’t wealthy.”</p><p>“For under $5, we could have a large and nourishing, if not entirely gourmet, lunch,” Mr. Mehta said, adding that the B.Y.O.B. policy was also a selling point for college students. </p><p>The restaurants each had a unique flair: Some were dressed in lights, like Panna II and its neighbors, while others had fabrics on the walls. Mr. Mehta said he remembered one restaurant hired a sitar player.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“He wasn’t very good,” Mr. Mehta added.</p><p>The restaurants brought in crowds excited to try a cuisine that was new to them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The dining room of Milon in 1997.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Greenberg for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Packing up takeout orders at Milon in 1997.

Business owners facing financial strain and growing competition moved out.</p><p>“I’m missing all my friends — all the customers that used to come,” said Abdul Patwary, the owner of the spice and grocery store Duals Natural, which opened in 1989 and is one of the few remaining businesses from the era.</p><p>At 93 First Avenue, the competition began to heat up. The proprietors of Panna II and Milon, Mr. Khan and Olid Ahmed, each claimed to come up with the idea of hanging up string lights first. “This place was the original,” Mr. Khan said, a claim Mr. Ahmed also made in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-village-twins-aglow-on-restaurant-row.html" title="">a 1999 Times article</a>.

Students, and then tourists, flocked to the spot.</p><p>“In high school, it would be like cool girls would have their birthday parties here and post photos on Facebook with the lights in the background,” said Amara Leonard, 27, who grew up in New Jersey and visited Panna II last month for the first time in years.</p><p>The three restaurants hosted celebrities from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcJbWJsDVso/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=939ff189-f14c-4916-be3c-91ed92903ff0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vanessa Hudgens</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrissyteigen/p/CMGqX18h-CY/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chrissy Teigen</a> and John Legend. A picture of the model Emily Ratajkowski with Mr. Khan from her birthday party in 2018 hangs on a wall in the restaurant alongside pictures of other famous visitors.</p><p>But as suddenly as business appeared to boom again, it stopped. The coronavirus pandemic forced all three restaurants to temporarily shut down. Milon closed permanently months later.</p><p>Royal Bangladesh tried to make a comeback, but ultimately closed its doors in 2022.</p><p>Mr. Khan closed his restaurant for a year after he was hospitalized with Covid. Once he reopened, he took over the lease for Milon’s space, but gave it up this fall when the rent jumped to $8,000 per month. (He took over Milon’s website and phone number to sell takeout.) As the blog <a href="https://evgrieve.com/2024/09/dimmed-lights-on-1st-avenue-only-1.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EV Grieve</a> wrote when it broke the news: “And then there was one.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Some saw it as the end of the long and winding arc of Little India.</p><p>“It’s really useful to look at the dusk of the Bangladeshi-Indian restaurants as a metaphor for what’s happened to the East Village in general,” Mr. Mehta said. “There’s something that’s lost.”</p><p>He added, “These places have a special hold on our heart.”</p><p>For the Panna II space, Mr. Khan said he now pays $6,000 a month — plus $1,500 to $2,000 for those lights. But he has kept almost every meal on the menu below $20.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Decades ago, dozens of restaurants offered Indian fare in the East Village.
