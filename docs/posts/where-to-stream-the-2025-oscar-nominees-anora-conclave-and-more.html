I’m the writer, director and editor of “Anora.” This is the scene in which our protagonist, Ani, played by Mikey Madison, is arriving at the house supposedly owned by Ivan Zakharov, who is played by Mark Eydelshteyn. So this was obviously supposed to bring not only Ani into Ivan’s world, but the audience into Ivan’s world. So I wanted the camera to essentially be following Ani, but also be seeing the world through Ani’s eyes. That’s why I did my best to not make it very cutty, especially when she arrives up at the front door and comes into the house. That is a one shot. “So welcome to my humble aboard. Hugs! Because I really wanted the audience to be walking through this space with Ani and seeing the space for the first time with Ani. So when she turns and looks to the right, the camera is turning and looking to the right. When she looks to the left, the camera’s turning and looking to the left. And what it does is that it really sets up the geography because the geography is going to be extremely important later on in the film, especially in the home invasion scene. So Drew Daniels, my amazing cinematographer who I’ve worked with now twice, he is a master at handheld camera operation, so he’s the one who’s actually holding the camera and shooting this entire sequence. “Not too shabby!” “What is ‘shabby’?” “Oh, I’m just playing.” Drew’s handheld cinematography is about as steady as handheld can get, especially with a heavy camera like this. And then he lands in this beautiful two shot. For me as an editor, that gave me a really solid out to cut to our wide static shot. “Oh, sorry, I’m waiting for you.” This was my wonderful actors adding a little bit of improv there, where Mark runs up the stairs. And then the next shot where they’re coming into the bedroom. This shot will be repeated at the end of the film. So in many ways it’s bookending her experience at this mansion. “Nice view.” “My view is better.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/anora-anatomy1-jhpl/anora-anatomy1-jhpl-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The writer, director and editor Sean Baker narrates a sequence from his comedy featuring Mikey Madison and Mark Eydelshteyn.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Neon</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Best picture, director, actress, supporting actor, original screenplay, editing.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> Rent it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anora-Sean-Baker/dp/B0DJCMQKPT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/anora/umc.cmc.ka0xf4gk3tckil4x7x14hpcy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/Anora/3585835" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fandango at Home</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Anora?id=Qvna5-y0WK8.P" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Gq4Vh9RfI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>The writer-director Sean Baker’s rambunctious film concerns the whirlwind romance between a sex worker from Brighton Beach and the son of a Russian oligarch. It somehow channels both the madcap energy of classic screwball and the unfiltered emotion of John Cassavetes. Much of that liveliness is owed to Mikey Madison’s firecracker of a performance as Ani, a stripper whose time with a handsome young party animal, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), at first seems like a “Pretty Woman” fantasy. But a quickie marriage draws attention from Ivan’s minders in the states and his parents abroad. Ani’s fight for their relationship, which turns literal at times, is alternately slapstick and touching.</p><h2 id="link-39a7f261">‘Emilia Pérez’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/15/multimedia/emilia-perez-anatomy1-mwlj/emilia-perez-anatomy1-mwlj-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The director Jacques Audiard narrates a sequence featuring the song “El Mal” from his film, with Zoe Saldaña and Karla Sofía Gascón.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Shanna Besson/Netflix</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Best picture, director, actress, supporting actress, adapted screenplay, international feature film, original score, original song, cinematography, makeup and hairstyling, sound, editing.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=emilia&amp;jbv=81901696" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stream it on Netflix</a>.</p><p>Undeniably audacious in its plotting and conceit, Jacques Audiard’s musical about the wild odyssey of a transgender cartel boss in Mexico goes to places most movies wouldn’t dare, including a showstopper set during a transition surgery. Though stylish and briskly entertaining, “Emilia Pérez” is not short on other provocations, too, starting with the physical and moral transformation of a kingpin (Karla Sofía Gascón) who hires a lawyer (Zoe Saldaña) to arrange a new life to go along with her secret shift in gender identification. When she emerges as a philanthropist seeking to locate the bodies of cartel victims, her past sins inevitably (and toe-tappingly) collide with the present.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>‘Wicked’ | Anatomy of a Scene</h2><h4>The director Jon M. Chu narrates a scene in “Wicked” that features the song “Popular,” with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Hi, This is Jon M. Chu and I am the director of “Wicked.” “And Elfie. Can I call you Elfie?” “Well, it’s a little bit perky.” So we’re about midpoint in the movie. And these two roommates, who are very different from each other, have moved into this semi-small dorm room. And it’s Glinda and Elphaba, played by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, and they’ve just bonded over sharing stories with each other. So this is the beginning of their true friendship, their first date, shall I say. This is a very iconic scene. “Popular” is one of those songs that everybody knows from “Wicked.” It’s probably the most used in talent shows, and there was a lot of pressure to do this right and to find our way cinematically into this. But of course, it’s all around Ariana Grande’s performance here of showboating and showing her power to transform Elphaba into someone who could be popular. “Exactly what they need.” And Ari is just a master of comedy. You can see it in all her moves and how she interacts with Cynthia Erivo. When you actually listen to it too, it’s her beats and her pauses are just masterful. Paul Tazewell, our costume designer, designed this beautiful, new word I learned, peignoir, for her that has now become iconic on all the dolls and things, and this giant chandelier that she swings on. It seems simple, but actually there’s a lot of manpower that is running that thing. There’s a guy actually on top who’s spinning it and helping her get around, and this was a lot of play for us. We got to really allow the song to come in and take our time to come in. We had a pianist in the corner because everything is live as well, so that she could use her own tempo. “Popular, you’re going to be popular.” And what the concept was for this was rather than go into a giant closet because it’s a dorm room, that the closet was all the bags that we had seen in previous scenes. I love this moment where she grabs the ruby slippers and taps it three times as our nod to Wizard of Oz. But in each of these devices, even though again, they seem simple, there’s grown men in small spaces pulling it open and shutting it, and the engineering in each took months and months to design right. One of the biggest things that Cynthia really wanted was that she didn’t just want to be a passenger on this, she really wanted to be a part of it. She’s not resisting it as much as in the shown in fact, she’s actually really enjoying this attention and this friendship. “Not when it comes to popular” That mirror alone. It’s so heavy and has so much engineering. It’s actually very, very dangerous. Later she’ll actually step on it. And so that alone took many, many months to design, including this thing that folds back and that she falls back on. And I love this moment where she swans around her. We did this about 18 times. We had to grease up the floor. Her peignoir couldn’t get caught on that hanger. But again, Ari is a master of physical comedy and she does it like she was born to do it. “What?”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/wicked-anatomy1-pwhl/wicked-anatomy1-pwhl-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The director Jon M.

Chu, who most recently brought “In the Heights” to the screen, keeps his adaptation remarkably fleet afoot. Much of that buoyancy is owed to the mismatched buddy chemistry between Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, a green-skinned loner with a talent for sorcery, and Ariana Grande as Glinda, a bubbly good-witch-to-be who befriends Elphaba at a university. As Glinda strains to boost the outcast among her peers, Elphaba starts to get a better sense of her powers and how they might be wielded in the Land of Oz.</p><h2 id="link-4ed190b8">‘Conclave’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-13"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>‘Conclave’ | Anatomy of a Scene</h2><h4>The director Edward Berger narrates a sequence from his film, featuring Ralph Fiennes.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Hi, My name is Edward Berger and I’m the director of the movie “Conclave.” So we’re about 30 minutes into the movie. We’ve set up the place as the Vatican and the Pope has died. And now Cardinal Lawrence, the character played by Ralph Fiennes, is the Dean of the College of Cardinals, meaning he has to organize the coming election of the new pope. And now it’s his big day because it’s the first day of the conclave, meaning all the doors are being shut. The cardinals are going away into the Sistine Chapel to vote for this next pope. And Ralph Fiennes gives the introductory speech, a homily. And we chose this piece of music at the very beginning. It’s actually the only music that isn’t composed. Everything else is composed in the movie. So it’s the only kind of source music sung by a choir. And it is the only piece of music that is played in the Sistine Chapel for hundreds of years. And I found this fact on a 6:00 AM morning tour. We went to the Sistine Chapel on a guided tour with and it was empty. It’s the only time that it’s empty. If you go at 6:00 AM and the guide told us that this was the piece of music. So I looked it up and found it and found it immensely moving and beautiful. So I decided to put it into the movie. So Ralph starts out the speech in Italian, and Ralph spent a long time practicing Italian, and he was actually very, very adamant. We always had a dialogue coach or someone like an Italian woman there who listened to his diction and everything. She was very satisfied of how he performed it because also he was super meticulous that it felt believable that he’s lived there for 25 years and has practiced Italian for 25 years. So we paid a lot of attention to that. But then at some point, something comes over him, a feeling. And he stops. And then he switches into his natural language, which is English. “But you know all that.” “Let me speak from the heart for a moment.” And delivers a speech about really his true feelings, and that is doubt. He expresses his doubt about his own faith, about his own purpose in the church, about the Church in general, about what he thinks the next pope should be like, someone who accepts doubt and gives in to doubt. And that intuitive speech, that giving into it raises a lot of eyebrows. In this scene, you will notice, we’re usually fairly wide on Ralph in the beginning when he speaks Italian. We’re from behind. We’re from a profile. And then as soon as he speaks from the heart, as soon as his speech changes, we go in for a close up, a very frontal central close up, and the camera starts moving. And then it’s actually just one shot. “Certainty is the great enemy of unity.” “Certainty is the deadly enemy of tolerance.” It’s just one shot, uninterrupted small push in on Ralph as he speaks and he loses himself within his words and he doesn’t notice anyone around him. And only then, once he’s finished. We cut to the reverse of a wide shot of all the cardinals listening. “If there was only certainty and no doubt, there would be no mystery and therefore no need for faith.” “Let us pray that God will grant us a pope who doubts.” The scene sets Ralph Fiennes up as a character to be reckoned with. He delivers the speech that comes from his heart and other Cardinals, especially the ones with ambition to become the next pope, suddenly fear that there’s a new contender in the room. And that is the climax of the scene.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/multimedia/conclave-anatomy1-pmct/conclave-anatomy1-pmct-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The director Edward Berger narrates a sequence from his film, featuring Ralph Fiennes.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Philippe Antonello/Focus Features</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Best picture, actor, supporting actress, adapted screenplay, original score, production design, costume design, editing.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-movies/conclave" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stream it on Peacock</a>.

When her grotesque network boss (Dennis Quaid) marks her 50th birthday by firing her from a popular TV aerobics show, Elizabeth Sparkle (Moore) pursues a new technology that will allow her to coexist with a younger version of herself. But tension quickly develops between Elizabeth and this perky new creation (Margaret Qualley), sparking a metaphysical battle that takes a toll on both of them. The intoxications of celebrity and vanity play a role in “The Substance,” but the film is just as much about a society that sets women against each other — even if, in this case, they’re sort of the same woman.</p><h2 id="link-278c0f0d">‘Dune: Part Two’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>After doing the vexing work of successfully bringing Frank Herbert’s novel to the screen with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/movies/dune-review.html" title="">first part of “Dune” in 2021</a>, the director Denis Villeneuve faces a complicated balancing act in “Dune: Part Two,” which contends with the potentially destructive consequences of its hero’s ascendence.

But as Paul starts to meet the prophetic expectations of his most fervent followers, there are signs of a holy war that could have terrible consequences.</p><h2 id="link-3338428c">‘A Real Pain’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Best supporting actor, original screenplay.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/62d4dbff-7de6-4940-9aba-d7acd6c96237" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stream it on Hulu</a>.</p><p>In a performance that embodies the dual meaning of the writer-director-star Jesse Eisenberg’s unsettling comedy-drama, Kieran Culkin carries over much of the agitation and unfiltered language that made him a standout as Roman Roy on HBO’s “Succession.” But there are distinct pockets of vulnerability to his character in “A Real Pain,” a lonely drifter who joins his cousin (Eisenberg) on a group tour of Polish-Jewish heritage sites in the wake of their grandmother’s death. His tendency to speak his mind even in the most delicate situations gives the film a high cringe factor, but his honesty has a profound impact on the people around him and he proves more sensitive to his surroundings than he appears to be.</p><h2 id="link-2df7d2">‘The Apprentice’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Best actor, best supporting actor.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> Rent it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.fda172d7-e9af-4646-b68b-afda4a18d3cf?autoplay=0&amp;ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/the-apprentice/umc.cmc.gqlgc62ubabtnfsr31nhr5v2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV+</a>, <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/The-Apprentice/3613702?cmp=OrganicSearch~Vudu~GoogleWatch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fandango at Home</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXl_jXNv1As" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p><p>The phrase “humble beginnings” doesn’t necessarily apply to the second son of a wealthy New York real estate magnate, but the young Donald Trump of “The Apprentice,” played by Sebastian Stan, was still trying to find his footing on the scene in the 1970s. To that end, his meeting with the notoriously rapacious lawyer Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong), who’d successfully prosecuted the Rosenbergs and served as Joseph McCarthy’s right hand in anti-Communist hearings, sets off a lucrative and sinister mentorship. As Trump’s ego swells along with his fortunes in the ’80s, however, the relationship between the two men starts to strain and “The Apprentice” evolves into a cautionary tale about the price of ruthless ambition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><h3 id="link-63c34286"><span><strong>Other major nominees</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-1a354">‘Flow’</h2><p><strong>Nominated for:</strong> Best international feature, animated feature.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://play.max.com/show/83df1c2b-db9d-49cd-bf83-9ddbaa7e5e30?utm_source=universal_search&amp;utm_id=1011l5873&amp;utm_source=justwatchgmbh&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;clickref=1100lA93NKDT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stream it on Max.</a> Rent it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Gints-Zilbalodis/dp/B0DNQFPDTW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QVIXQ5DV0707&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vz_oUjY_1601VChHqGOUKkzcRP4vn3YJFaGytFFJ-m-LzFSI969oPYOxWnf2P6nuoLFToJxd_3wkjR32FLbtZXIIeZmq3dPrfbi5MHR1Oa8i2Zg7gyHZetDK0yxeIw3L1QdS564UhGyKN0ZllmMv09gQ9VUmIxOqqAtn7Kd2nr1Gu87f2OMqcJOdof8ooAtoIKfgRo6Be_eIqK3NhHkd1nAWmF85E-FGhHCQiGKxu70.yBEayZFJyX-GEIN7y7Srm4dg9g635sXjTs57-YPziEE&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=flow+movie&amp;qid=1737641803&amp;sprefix=flow+,aps,273&amp;sr=8-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/flow/umc.cmc.22galt2spi1jlic15bdjvf1mz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple TV+</a> and <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/Flow/3931216?CMP=NSP_JustWatch~FAH" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fandango at Home</a>.</p><h2 id="link-3d9ab917">‘Inside Out 2’</h2><p><strong>Nominated for: </strong>Best animated feature.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-ec9f9fa3-fbae-4a25-b722-12c3b8ab0ef4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stream it on Disney+</a>.
