<p>This year, teams participating in their respective Challengers circuits now have a path to qualifying for Champions through the VCT Pacific Stage 2 playoffs. Championship points return in 2026, with the top two teams on the points leaderboard qualifying for Champions, along with the top two teams from the Stage 2 playoffs.</p>



<p><img src="https://owcdn.net/img/693f81c9edc31.jpg" alt="The 2026 Pacific Kickoff bracket."/>
<em>The 2026 Pacific Kickoff bracket.</em></p>

<p>Pacific Kickoff will take place from January 22 to February 15, and for the first time ever, the event has been restructured to be a triple elimination bracket. Teams will have three strikes before they are eliminated, and will fight for the region&#39;s three slots to qualify for the season&#39;s first international event, Masters Santiago.</p>

<p>At Kickoff, the region&#39;s four representatives at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions Paris</a> will receive a first-round bye in the Upper Bracket, while the rest of the teams have been placed via a random draw.</p>

<p>The new format provides teams with more playing time, ensuring three games are played, and reduces the downtime between Kickoff and Stage 1.</p>



<p>Stage 1 will run from April 3 to May 17, and will follow a similar format to 2025, with two groups of six teams playing a round robin with best-of-three matches within their group. The top four teams from the group stage will advance to the Stage 1 playoffs.</p>

<p>In the playoffs, the eight remaining teams will compete in a best-of-three double-elimination bracket, with best-of-five matches played out in the Lower Final and Grand Final. The top seed from each group will earn a first-round bye in the Upper Bracket, while the fourth-placed teams will begin their playoff runs in the lower bracket.</p>

<p>The top 3 teams from Stage 1 playoffs will qualify for Masters London, the second international event of the year.</p>

<em>The path to Champions Shanghai.</em></p>

<p>Stage 2 will run from July 16 to September 6, and will again have two groups of six teams. The top two teams from each group will qualify directly to the Stage 2 playoffs, while the remaining eight teams, comprising of teams placed third to sixth in the group, will move to the Play-In stage. At the Play-In, they will be joined by four teams from the region&#39;s Challengers leagues to compete in a double-elimination bracket. The third and fourth-placed teams from each group will earn a first-round bye in the upper bracket. The top four teams from the Play-Ins will advance to the Stage 2 playoffs.</p>

<p>The final eight teams will battle through a best-of-three double-elimination bracket, with best-of-five matches played during the Lower Final and Grand Final. The top-placing teams from the Stage 2 group stage will receive first-round byes in the upper bracket, while the third and fourth-placed teams from the play-ins start in the lower bracket.</p>

<p>At the end of Stage 2, the top two teams will advance to Champions 2026, where they will be joined by the top two teams that qualify via Championship Points.</p>



<p>The full schedule for VCT Pacific 2026 is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kickoff: January 22 to February 15</li>
<li>Stage 1: April 3 to May 17</li>
<li>Stage 2: July 16 to September 6</li>
</ul>

<p>Matches will begin at 15:00 GMT+7 // 16:00 GMT+8 // 17:00 GMT+9 each matchday.</p>



<p>VCT Pacific Kickoff action will be broadcast through local language broadcasts on SOOP, Twitch, YouTube, Chzzk, and other platforms.</p>
