<p>Novo Nordisk’s share price</p>
</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Sales of that drug created boom times for Novo Nordisk. In 2023, the company’s extraordinary success <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/novo-s-rise-forces-denmark-to-keep-rates-lower-danske-says?sref=zVYYYI5e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prompted</a> the Danish central bank to keep interest rates lower than it otherwise would. For more than a year, Novo Nordisk’s market value surpassed Denmark’s entire gross domestic product.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But investors have soured on the company as it has faced increasingly fierce competition. Lower-cost copycat versions of the weight-loss drugs made through a process known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/health/obesity-drugs-fda-compounding-wegovy-zepbound.html" title="">compounding</a> have cut into Novo Nordisk’s sales. Even more damaging has been competition from Eli Lilly, the maker of the drug sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound.</p><p>Novo Nordisk had a head start, winning approval to market its drug for obesity more than two years before Eli Lilly. But Novo Nordisk has been rapidly losing market share to its competitor: American patients have filled more prescriptions this year for Zepbound than for Wegovy, and the gap has been widening, according to the industry data provider IQVIA.</p><p>Eli Lilly is also developing new weight-loss drugs, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/health/weight-loss-pill-eli-lilly.html" title="">a daily pill</a>, that are expected to set up years of blockbuster sales for the company. Novo Nordisk has a hazier path forward.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rebecca Robbins is a Times reporter covering the pharmaceutical industry.
