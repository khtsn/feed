It hosts reading groups focused on the Western canon. And it has brought in speakers like Peter Thiel, the conservative billionaire, and Adrian Vermeule, a Harvard law professor who has supported the idea of a worldwide Catholic theocracy.</p><p>The catch? It is not a part of Harvard.</p><p>The Abigail Adams Institute is an independent institute that is part of a broader network of about a dozen centers located near elite universities, including Yale, Princeton and Stanford. The goal is to create an intellectual community that supplements what students can find on their own campuses.</p><p>The institute’s director said recent national and international turbulence has led more students to come to its events (a recent talk was standing room only). At a time when Harvard is under scrutiny by Republicans who argue its campus leans left, students involved with the institute say it is serving up information and discussions that can be hard to find in university classrooms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A perception among conservatives that their views are excluded on elite university campuses has become one of the points of contention in an ongoing battle between Harvard and the Trump administration. The federal government has <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demanded</a> that Harvard submit to an external review of its disciplines for “viewpoint diversity” and an audit of hiring practices to make sure departments were not using “ideological litmus tests,” among other things.</p><p>Harvard has refused, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/harvard-lawsuit-trump-administration.html" title="">suing</a> the government after it threatened to slash federal grants in an effort to force compliance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A shelf of books, most published by the Institute, at their office in Cambridge, Mass.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lucy Lu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The institute is part of a broader network of about a dozen centers located near elite universities.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lucy Lu for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The administration’s moves follow years of concerns among conservative thinkers and groups that elite college campuses are bastions of liberal thought. Abigail Adams — and other centers like it — are backed by the Foundation for Excellence in Higher Education, a group funded by conservative donors that aims to shift university teaching toward traditional Western education.</p><p>A Harvard spokesman declined a request for an interview, noting the Abigail Adams Institute’s independence from the university. But Alan M. Garber, the university president, recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/arts/harvard-trump-viewpoint-diversity.html" title="">pledged</a> to speed up the creation of a campus initiative on viewpoint diversity, and in a May <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/harvard-response-trump-letter.html" title="">letter responding</a> to the Trump administration, he said that the two have “common ground,” including in fostering “intellectual diversity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some students and faculty members have criticized the administration for caving to <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/harvard-university-trump-lawsuit-palestine-academic-integrity/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">right-wing demands</a>. But students who participate in the institute said the campus needs more places open to heterodox opinions.</p><p>Shani Agarwal Hood, who earned a master’s degree from Harvard Divinity School in 2023, sought out the institute when she arrived at Harvard in search of a literary salon culture, friends and free inquiry.</p><p>She believes Harvard hasn’t always struck the right balance between fostering a respectful and inclusive environment and protecting free expression. As a Catholic, she said, her views have sometimes clashed with those of her peers.</p><p>“Why is it that students who don’t agree with mainstream opinions feel like they can’t speak up?” she asked. At the Abigail Adams Institute, she added, “you’re encouraged to speak your mind no matter what side you’re taking.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Abigail Adams Institute is just steps from Harvard Yard.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Glanzman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Perhaps to her point, the institute has developed a mixed reputation on campus. Several Harvard students and professors said that some students actively avoid the institute because of its association with conservative views.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Sofia Mikulasek, a Harvard junior, said she first joined the Abigail Adams Institute after seeing a campus poster for a Sophocles reading group. Ms. Mikulasek, who does not identify as politically conservative, found the reading group to be apolitical and a good complement to her studies as a philosophy major.</p><p>But she said some of her classmates made assumptions about her political views when they learned of her participation, and the conservative donors backing the center also made her uncomfortable.</p><p>“I was vaguely aware that conservative donors were part of it in some abstract way. Honestly, it’s a little scary to me,” she said. “Free inquiry and, you know, reading books from the Western canon should not be conservative things, right?”</p><p>The group is adjacent to a constellation of campus clubs that appeal to conservatives, including The Harvard Salient, a revived conservative outlet that once published behind only pseudonyms; the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/12/13/john-adams-society-feature/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Adams Society</a>, a semi-secret debate club founded in 2014; and the Republican club, which has seen its membership grow exponentially over the last few years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Danilo Petranovich, the institute’s director, said it is nonpartisan and donors have exercised “zero interference with any substantive programming.” In 2023, the institute reported about $5 million in contributions, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/471495965/202333529349301053/full" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to its tax filing, including some from foundations and groups associated with conservative causes.</p><p>Some of the senior fellows who contribute to the institute’s programming include Arthur C. Brooks, the former president of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, and Erika Bachiochi, a socially conservative legal scholar who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-erika-bachiochi.html" title="">argued</a> that abortion rights have hindered women’s equality.</p><p>Dr. Petranovich previously taught great books classes at Yale. He said the institute, which was founded in 2014, seeks to promote open and civil inquiry at Harvard and to bring in voices that are not typically represented at the university. He added that he was more interested in encouraging students to take their academic work seriously than in political activism.</p><p>Many students who come are conservative, he said, but not all.</p><p>“Politics is important,” he said. “But the work we’re doing is more fundamental.”</p><p>In its public communications and programming, the institute has largely avoided addressing the controversies roiling Harvard, though they have occasionally been mentioned. In an April social media post, it praised Harvard’s decision to create new introductory arts and humanities courses as a “promising development in the humanities during a tumultuous year.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The center recruits participants through word of mouth, student emails, fliers and posters, and not everyone who comes is a student. Dr. Petranovich also occasionally visits Harvard classes to promote the institute directly. Sometimes it uses Harvard classrooms for its events, at the invitation of professors or a program within the university that is backed by the same foundation.</p><p>Recently, about a dozen students and recent graduates convened for a reading group called “The Great Conversation,” where they compared Michel Foucault’s views on emancipation and ideology with those of thinkers such as Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill and Hannah Arendt. At another, attendees packed a Harvard classroom on a sunny spring afternoon — some standing in the back — for a lecture on the architectural history of Boston.</p><p>Musa al-Gharbi, a sociologist at Stony Brook University who advocates viewpoint diversity in higher education, said that the Abigail Adams Institute and similar groups only result in an “echo chamber” that doesn’t move the needle on campus discourse.</p><p>But Neil Gross, a sociology professor at Colby College and the author of the book “Why are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care?”, said groups like Abigail Adams are trying to show that “there is real demand among students for something different than they think higher ed is offering.”</p><p>He likened the Abigail Adams Institute to lobbying firms that set up near government buildings, adding: “Their hope is to actually reform the university.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Selig is a Times national reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.</p></div><div><p>Simon J.
