    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>For the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/artists-questionnaire" title="">Artist’s Questionnaire</a> series, T asks a creative person a set of questions about everything from their earliest works to their daily routine.</p><hr/><p>The artist Zanele Muholi finds the people they photograph at parties, weddings and funerals. Muholi also meets them at Pride rallies and protests for L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ rights in Johannesburg and Cape Town before taking the sitters’ portraits in a setting of their choosing. Muholi, who identifies as nonbinary, has a nomadic artistic practice; they move their studio with them through the country. “I work as I go. From any space. Whenever I feel like photographing [and wherever] is safe and conducive for a shoot,” they say. Their portraits are often black and white, which Muholi considers more timeless and less noisy than color, but the works are in no way quiet. In their self-portraits, Muholi’s use of deep saturation and heavy contrasts not only dramatizes the pigment of their skin but also blurs the line between photography and painting. Their portraits of others are typically more spare but are similarly striking, thanks to the direct eye contact of the sitters, who seem to be assessing the viewer in return and whom Muholi calls “participants” rather than “subjects.”</p><p>On a midsummer morning, Muholi, 52, spoke to me over the phone from their hometown Durban, South Africa, following stints in California and London, where they have multiple exhibitions on view. At the <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/zanele-muholi-eye-me/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a> and at <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/zanele-muholi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London’s Tate Modern</a> are surveys of Muholi’s work from the early 2000s until now; the latter revives a 2020 presentation that closed prematurely because of the pandemic. Both exhibitions primarily feature Muholi’s photographs of Black queer communities in South Africa, posed in scenes of tenderness and defiance, including “Brave Beauties” (2014-ongoing), a series of glamour shots of trans women and nonbinary people; and “Faces and Phases” (2006-ongoing), an ambitious archive of over 600 portraits of queer South Africans, which is accompanied by firsthand video testimonies from several of the participants.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/01/t-magazine/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/01/t-magazine/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/01/t-magazine/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A large silver sculpture of coiled tubing stands in a warehouse space next to a wooden bench." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/01/t-magazine/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/01/t-magazine/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/01/t-magazine/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/01/t-magazine/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47/17tmag-muho-slide-LF47-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An edition of Muholi’s “Bambatha” (2023) sculpture during the fettling and assembly process.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>On display simultaneously at Southern Guild in Los Angeles are new works exploring Muholi’s interest in gender, sexuality and presentations of the body: Alongside self-portraits from their open-ended series “Somnyama Ngonyama” (Hail The Dark Lioness), begun in 2012, are large-scale bronze sculptures of the artist and of a clitoris and a uterus. In “Somnyama Ngonyama,” Muholi combines techniques of classical painting, fashion photography and traditional ethnographic imagery; their exaggerated skin tone, nude figure and unconventional, architectural headdresses are the artist’s reclamations of Black beauty. “The sculptural pieces [are] an expansion of [my] self portraits,” exploring “the agony and ecstasy” of the queer Black female body, says Muholi. The sculpture “Being” (2023) depicts the artist dressed in clerical robes, head tilted back and one hand sitting atop a golden object that resembles a disembodied oversize labia. In their bronze anatomical works, as in their photographs, Muholi seems committed to individualizing the queer Black body, rather than dissecting it for voyeuristic inspection.</p></div><div><p>Muholi’s creative work has always been synchronous with their advocacy, as they foreground the personal histories of people experiencing homophobic bigotry and violence throughout South Africa. They prefer the title “visual activist” over that of artist. “It’s very important to make sure that as laws are put in place and transformation takes place, there’s a picture that backs all of that [history] up,” they say. They see their work as less of an individual practice and more of a deeply collaborative, explicitly political project — “a project that not only speaks to the now, but a project that speaks to the future.” Below, Muholi answers T’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/artists-questionnaire" title="">Artist’s Questionnaire</a>.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Muholi examines their cast sculptures.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>What’s your day like? How much do you sleep, and what’s your work schedule?</strong></p><p>My morning starts with a walk to activate my body. I have trouble sleeping these days because I think a lot. I haven’t scheduled much [work] lately. I was messed up by jet lag. I was abroad in San Francisco, then Los Angeles, then London. By the time I got to London, I was just in a state. Now, I’ve been doing some research in order to get started with a new project.</p><p><strong>How many hours of creative work do you think you do in a day?</strong></p><p>It’s not like a 9-to-5 job. Sometimes it could be just an hour, and I’d be content and know that I’ve got what I want. It could be that I need one picture today. But I can’t say I need one or two or three or five pictures every day.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An untitled patinated bronze sculpture in progress, surrounded by foundry equipment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An in-progress edition of Muholi’s “Mmotshola Metsi (The Water Bearer)” (2023) sculpture in unpatinated bronze.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p><strong>What’s the first piece of art you ever made?</strong></p><p>It was a self portrait, “Zol” (2002).</p><p><strong>What’s the worst studio you ever had?</strong></p></div></div><div><p>[I’ve never had] a fixed studio. My bedroom could be the studio. The lounge could be the studio. The kitchen could be the studio. My experience is to be supercareful and safe. If I work under a bridge, there’s movement and cars. Somebody might come in a rush as we’re using equipment. Security is always my concern unless I’m working indoors.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A resin copy of the sculpture “Muholi V” (2023).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>When you start a new piece, where do you begin?</strong></p><p>The first step is to do some research. Converse with different people to [figure out] if they relate to the experience [that I want to explore] or not. For “Somnyama Ngonyama,” I had a deep discussion with my sisters, because Ngonyama is my mother’s clan name; I needed to know more about where she came from and how she connected to that surname. Also, I try to sketch, but I can’t say I’m good at that.</p><p><strong>How do you know when you’re done?</strong></p><p>I guess when you can’t move [forward] anymore, then that’s that. But there’s never any moment in which I think: “I’m complete.” And yet, what you think isn’t done might seem complete to [another] person who’s looking at that final production.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>To the right of a stack of fragmented casting molds atop a shelf in the foundry are black resin copies of Muholi’s “Being” (2023) and “Muholi III” (2022).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>How many assistants do you have?</strong></p><p>[Since the beginning of this year,] I’ve been working with one person who helps me with [logistics] and also with driving. Before that, I used to work with three people: I had a person who wrote and documented almost all that we were doing, and another person shooting behind the scenes, and then someone who was doing mostly PR work.</p><p><strong>What music do you play when you’re making art?</strong></p><p>When I used to paint throughout the night, I played South African gospel music a lot. This was between 2019 and 2021, mainly during the Covid lockdown. I have faith, and that keeps me going. I believed that things were going to be better because not only was I creating, [I was also] healing. It was deeply personal.</p><p><strong>What’s the weirdest object in your studio?</strong></p><p>I have a lot of notebooks that aren’t complete. I’ll start sketching or putting down some ideas or thoughts that never get done.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A tool cabinet at the foundry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Various molds on a shelf.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p><strong>What’s the last thing that made you cry?</strong></p><p>There’s a documentary called “Difficult Love” (2010) [about the challenges faced by Black lesbians in South Africa, directed by myself and Peter Golsmid]. It features part of my mother’s funeral. [Rewatching that film] affects me in so many ways because it’s said that our late parents or family members are still with us, even though they’re not physically there. So I cry and pray, hoping that my mom listens to me or that she’s hearing me somehow, wherever she is. There’s a time to cry when there are tears, but then there’s crying when it’s not about shedding a tear as such, but about a broken heart. That loss that makes you feel alone without having any tears. What keeps us awake at night — that’s a cry in a way. The thought of the many people I’ve photographed and lost along the way saddens me.</p><p><strong>It’s what we’ve been discussing throughout: the importance of documenting Black lives and queer lives because of that fraught relationship between life and death for marginalized peoples.</strong></p><p>The loss isn’t even past tense. It’s now. It’s the thought of tomorrow, of losing those we don’t even know yet.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A hook rack of casting gear.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>When did you first feel comfortable saying you’re a professional artist?</strong></p><p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve said that I’m creating photographs that will speak to the future and change lives.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>How often do you talk to other artists?</strong></p><p>I haven’t spoken much [to other artists in 2024] because I’ve been going through some things. But [for the 10 years prior], I engaged with a lot of artists. I had a scholarship. I had many projects that involved other people. It was a lot. This year, someone said to me, “You need to learn to engage in self-love and self-care.” This year, I just needed to find a space of healing, to reflect, to process.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hair details of the wax copy of Muholi’s “Bambatha” (2023) sculpture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The outer shell of the mold for Muholi’s “Bambatha” sculpture; a cut on the left side reveals the rubber interior.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Manyatsa Monyamane</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p><strong>If you have windows at your current location, what do they look out on?</strong></p><p>I’m in a coastal town now. I can see South Beach [from my home in Durban]. There’s a breeze. There’s water around. I feel better when I’m near the sea or a river or a beach.</p><p><strong>What do you usually wear when you work?</strong></p><p>When I work with paint, I wear dark clothing, aprons. But when I photograph [myself, I wear] many things — plastic, different objects, wood, washing machine tubes.</p><p><strong>What do you bulk buy with the most frequency?</strong></p><p>Film and analog cameras.</p><p><strong>What’s your worst habit?</strong></p><p>My worst habit is not even a worst habit; it’s an issue of safety. I check whether I’ve locked the doors more than twice.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Do you exercise?</strong></p><p>I walk a lot. I just came from doing 15,000 steps — over four miles.</p><p><strong>What embarrasses you?</strong></p><p>Any kind of rudeness. I try not to be rude. People who like to insult people and who just won’t say anything positive — that embarrasses me. I try to not be unkind to other people, because I think that we need each other.</p><p><strong>What are you reading?</strong></p><p>I can’t get over “Faces and Phases 2006-2014.” It’s beautiful essays and beautiful photographs. Even though I made it, I keep on going back to this book. This is the best I’ve ever done.</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore T Magazine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Everyday Buildings, Dollhouse Scale: </strong>Miniaturists are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/t-magazine/miniatures-city-artists.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-t-mag&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">memorializing the architecture of quickly changing cities</a> with meticulous renderings of corner stores, restaurants and even dumpsters.</p></li><li><p><strong>How Gay Body Culture Became Everybody’s Culture: </strong>In Hollywood, on Instagram and beyond, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/t-magazine/gay-men-muscles-body-culture.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-t-mag&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">the male-on-male gaze still decides what’s hot and what’s not</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Beauty of Queer Black South Africa: </strong>The artist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/t-magazine/zanele-muholi-tate-modern-sfmoma.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-t-mag&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Zanele Muholi</a> discusses visual activism, gospel music and walking more than 15,000 steps in a day.</p></li><li><p><strong> Tapestries Are Back: </strong>Leafy antique wall hangings are having a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/t-magazine/wall-tapestry-tips.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-t-mag&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">resurgence in the design world</a>, showing up in even the most modern rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Italian Nobleman’s Villa: </strong>Jacopo Etro, the eldest son of the Etro family, joined the throngs buying up centuries-old properties in Puglia, Italy, but had the good sense to leave his centuries-old home (mostly) alone.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div>
