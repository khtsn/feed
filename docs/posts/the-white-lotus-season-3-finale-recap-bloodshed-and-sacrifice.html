It was exactly the kind of season finale one might expect from the “White Lotus” creator, Mike White.</p><p>We will have a fuller recap of the finale soon, but for now, here is a quick rundown of where all of the season’s major characters and story lines landed, after an eventful week at a luxury Thailand resort.</p><h2 id="link-299277f2">The Ratliffs</h2><p>This family of North Carolina blue bloods — half Duke blue, half Tar Heel blue — has been at the center of this season’s juiciest story lines, with the patriarch, Tim, watching his business fall apart from afar while his wife, Victoria, fretted over her daughter Piper’s passion for Buddhism. Meanwhile, the sons Saxon and Lochlan flirted with both hedonism and spirituality — and, during one drunken night, with each other.</p><p>In the finale, Tim decided to protect his family from living a life of poverty and scandal by mixing the poisonous seeds of a local fruit into toxic piña coladas and serving them to his wife and kids — minus Lochlan, who had insisted earlier that a simpler life was no big deal to him. Tim immediately changed his mind and knocked the drinks out of everyone’s hands after a few sips, but the next day — in a moment of Mike White irony — Lochlan ended up drinking the poison seeds in a protein shake.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Lochlan survived the experience, and the brush with death seemed to have sobered up Tim, who left Thailand with his family — including Piper, who chose not to live with the Buddhists after all — and finally warned them about the troubles ahead for all of them.</p><h2 id="link-2bf2056d">The gal pals</h2><p>At the end of Episode 7, Laurie was chased out of the Russian crook Aleksei’s bedroom by his girlfriend. She then headed back to the villa she was sharing with her childhood friends Kate and Jaclyn, both of whom Laurie was very angry with: Jaclyn for pushing Laurie to flirt with the White Lotus masseuse Valentin and then sleeping with him herself, and Kate for being very judgmental about Laurie’s sloppy personal and professional life.</p><p>In the finale, the ladies forgive one another, and Laurie gives a moving speech about how even though she envies her friends’ more superficially perfect, happy lives, she still finds meaning in being close to these women whom she has known since girlhood. They leave Thailand with their bond restored … although not without one more moment of trauma, when they witness one of the finale’s murders. More on that below.</p><h2 id="link-e7b709d">Rick and Chelsea</h2><p>After Rick flew to Bangkok to look into the eyes of Jim Hollinger — the man Rick had always been told had killed his father — he returned to the White Lotus to reunite with his girlfriend, Chelsea, who had worried about him the whole time he was away. Everything seemed resolved. Chelsea was happy that he did not kill anyone, and Rick was happy to move on.</p><p>But then Jim returned to the resort, and he and Rick had a run-in in the dining room, during which Jim called Rick’s mother a drunk, a slut and a liar. Rick started stewing about this, and after he was unable to book an emergency session with a meditation instructor, he ran up to Jim while he and his wife, Sritala, were taking pictures with Jaclyn. Rick then stole Jim’s gun and shot him dead — after which Sritala told him something that a lot of “White Lotus” fans had already figured out: Jim was actually Rick’s father.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It gets worse: In the exchange of gunfire after the assassination, Chelsea was shot and killed.</p><h2 id="link-2ed4102d">Gaitok and Mook</h2><p>After realizing last week that Valentin and his pals Aleksei and Vlad had most likely robbed the White Lotus’s luxury goods store, Gaitok faced a choice. Should he tell his bosses, Fabian and Pee Lek, and let them handle it? Or should he try to advance his career — and win Mook’s heart — by confronting the Russians himself?</p><p>In the end, Gaitok chose neither path. He talked with Valentin, who begged him not to expose him or his pals; if they were deported back to Russia, he said, they would almost certainly be killed there. Weighing his conscience as a Buddhist, Gaitok decided that if his actions were to lead to someone’s death, he must avoid those actions.</p><p>And yet … In the episode’s climactic sequence, as Rick was fleeing the crime scene with Chelsea in his arms, Gaitok shot him in the back and killed him, urged on by Sritala. He was rewarded in the end with the plum bodyguard job he always wanted — and with Mook’s admiration — but only after betraying his principles.</p><h2 id="link-75b861fc">Belinda and Zion</h2><p>When last we left Belinda, her son, Zion, was all but demanding that she take a payoff from the sleazy Greg (known in Thailand as “Gary”) and ignore that the man may have been responsible for the death of her almost business partner, Tanya. Zion joined his mom at Greg’s house for a renegotiation, asking for $5 million instead of $100,000. Greg agreed to the settlement, and Belinda ditched her plans to open a spa with her Thai lover, Pornchai — thus becoming just like Tanya in Season 1, who ditched Belinda when her fortunes changed.</p><h2 id="link-5a935cd3">The events everyone will be talking about</h2><p>On the whole, the event for which Season 3 of “The White Lotus” will most likely be remembered was when Saxon and Lochlan got uncomfortably intimate during a threesome. Frank’s monologue about exploring the extremes of his sexuality was also a scene for the “White Lotus” Hall of Fame.</p><p>And from the finale? It is hard to top a poisoned protein shake, especially given that it looked for the longest time as if Lochlan were going to die. That is not necessarily a happy ending for him or the Ratliffs, except that they do get to keep living — which, according to the monk whom Piper admires, is what we all should want.</p><p><em>This is a developing article.
