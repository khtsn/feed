Trump’s sweeping election victory on Tuesday, the world is now preparing for another four years of unpredictability and “America first” protectionism that could reset the ground rules of the global economy, empower autocrats and erase the assurance of American protection for democratic partners.</p><p>Despite a lack of substantive foreign policy debate in the campaign, Mr. Trump has made several statements that — if turned into policy — would transform America’s relationship with both allies and adversaries. He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, a promise many assume amounts to the withdrawal of American aid for Ukraine, which would benefit Russia.</p><p>More broadly, he has made clear that he intends to make the world’s most powerful country more isolationist, more combative with tariffs, more openly hostile to immigrants, more demanding of its security partners, and less engaged on global challenges such as climate change.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many believe the impacts could be greater than anything seen since the start of the Cold War.</p><p>“It accelerates the already deep trend of an America looking inward,” said James Curran, a professor of modern history at the University of Sydney. “Allies are going to have to save the multilateral furniture while it’s still around — they have to hope that America buys back in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump addressing supporters in Palm Beach, Fla., in the early hours of Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By now, after witnessing his first term, the world already knows that the only certainty with Mr. Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/politics/trump-foreign-policy.html?searchResultPosition=23" title="">uncertainty</a>. He has often said that keeping the world guessing is his ideal foreign policy. And as the votes were counted, some officials around the world responded with public reassurances, stressing that elements of their relationships with the United States would not likely change.</p><p>Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani of Italy told Sky News that he believed Trump had “a natural sympathy for Italy” and that he was “convinced that we will work well with the tycoon’s new administration.”</p><p>In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum emphasized this week that there would be “good relations” with the United States because of the need to work together to address immigration and drugs, just days after Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico of between 25 percent and 100 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Migrants being processed after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents on the U.S.-Mexico border in Sunland Park, N.M., on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Kenya, Ndindi Nyoro, a lawmaker with President William Ruto’s governing coalition, said he thought Mr. Trump’s economic policies would be better for African countries, many of which are struggling with growing inflation and crushing debt.</p><p>“Republican policies have always been better for Africa &amp; the Global South,” Mr. Nyoro <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DaydayNyoro/posts/pfbid032ZYyFwBrqRgy6d3sjE1EmdKy2BHHS9D88vDCkJH3w7zvLxXWptRNkFUMD5WGSrqel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on Facebook</a>.</p><p>India has also been watching the American contest with interest and little concern, trusting that as the world’s most populous nation and fifth largest economy, it would still be courted as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/world/asia/modi-visit-us-india-biden.html" title="">a counterweight to China</a>.</p><h2 id="link-23cd8fe0">Bracing for a Return to Transactional Diplomacy</h2><p>The extremes of what Mr. Trump campaigned on — from sky-high tariffs against foreign products, to mass deportations and stiff resistance to wars and alliances deemed too messy or costly — have already put many nations on edge.</p><p>China, with its own economy in the doldrums, faces the likelihood of much broader, and higher tariffs than those already applied during Mr. Trump’s first term and continued by President Biden. Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said a second Trump presidency would “inevitably diminish global trust and respect for the United States.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Few of China’s neighbors, wary of Beijing, see cause for celebration in Trump’s victory.</p><p>South Korea and Japan expect to be pressured into paying more to have American troops based in their countries.

But on Wednesday he wrote on X that he appreciated “President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs.”</p><p>But many of Ukraine’s supporters in the region are “woefully unprepared for a return of Trump,” said Georgina Wright, a European politics expert at the Montaigne Institute in Paris. Analysts and officials on the continent expect a trade war, a bigger bill for NATO and military aid from Washington, the Trump-encouraged spread of anti-democratic populism, and a greater risk of Russia widening its territorial ambitions.</p><p>Mr. Trump has implied that he would not abide by the NATO article requiring collective defense, which kept Europe mostly peaceful and democratic for decades. At one point during his run for office, he said he would “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to countries that had not paid sufficient money to the alliance.</p><p>Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to Washington from 2014 to 2019 under the first Trump presidency, said that even if a second Trump presidency didn’t attempt to destroy NATO outright, his reticence about complying with its dictates had already made the alliance more fragile.</p><p>“It’s a question of credibility,” he said. “If you are Putin and on Jan. 22 you are wondering whether Trump will go to war to defend Estonia, of course he won’t. In a sense, it means that NATO will be hollowed from within.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destruction in Siversk, Ukraine, last month.
