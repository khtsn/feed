Officials urged millions of people out of possible harm’s way.</p><p>The evacuations started on Monday, slowing highways to a crawl, and grew in number on Tuesday, with officials warning there was no time to lose. Milton is expected to strike the vulnerable Tampa region, with its shallow bay and hundreds of miles of heavily developed coastline, late Wednesday or early Thursday. The area hasn’t had a direct hit from a hurricane in more than a century.</p><p>Some 5.5 million people live in the Tampa area and others, like Sarasota and Fort Myers, that were under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/weather/florida-evacuations-list-hurricane-milton.html" title="">mandatory or voluntary</a> evacuation orders as of Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And more orders were issued by local and state officials throughout the day, expanding the evacuation zone.</p><p>To try to keep major evacuation routes from clogging, officials urged residents to go to nearby shelters and not travel farther inland than necessary. Still, roads saw 150 percent of normal traffic on Monday, according to state officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It took three hours to drive 37 miles,” said Connie Leasure, who left her home in Largo, Fla., north of St. Petersburg, at 3 p.m. on Monday, heading to Pennsylvania. “If you got off the highway, you couldn’t get back on.”</p><p>Tolls were waived and highway shoulders were opened to try to keep cars moving, but traffic still slowed to 20 miles per hour in some spots. It eventually cleared by 1 a.m. on Tuesday, state officials said, though more jammed highways were expected later in the day as evacuation orders grew.</p><p>Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida encouraged people to leave using state roads, too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evacuees have also faced long lines at gas stations or no supply.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Octavio Jones/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Many people told to evacuate live in coastal and low-lying neighborhoods of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/30/climate/americans-moving-hurricane-wildfire-risk.html" title="">one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the country</a>, with about 3.5 million people. Others are further south, on barrier islands and in coastal towns that were hit by Hurricane Ian in 2022.</p><p>That does not mean entire cities are being cleared out. Tampa’s most vulnerable spots, for example, include the South Tampa neighborhood, parts of downtown and the area east of Tampa Bay. Parts of downtown St. Petersburg are near the water, but at a high enough elevation to be out of any evacuation zone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Tuesday morning, officials in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, said residents who evacuate need to plan on being in a safe place by 7 a.m. Wednesday, before the strongest effects of Milton begin to affect the region.</p><p>“Don’t panic,” said the county’s emergency management director, Timothy Dudley Jr. “You have time. Get somewhere safe, and we’ll see you on the other end.”</p><p>Evacuation orders are intended to move people away from deadly storm surge, not from a storm’s damaging winds. Florida’s strong building code means most newer buildings can withstand even a major hurricane, though residents may lose power, water, sewage and other services.</p><p>On Tuesday, many of the affected neighborhoods felt desolate, suggesting that residents had taken evacuation orders seriously, and that officials had delivered them with enough time for people to act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A news program was shown at a bar in Orlando, Fla.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Martinez/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Erin Roth, 43, said she decided to leave her home in Seminole, Fla., in the Tampa Bay area, even though it is not in a mandatory evacuation zone. She wanted to be sure her 15-year-old daughter and two dogs would be safe.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I was panicked,” she said. “I just thought we needed to go.”</p><p>The only rooms her family could find were in Atlanta. They left at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, and eight hours later had just made it to Valdosta, Ga., across the state line — about twice the time the trip would usually take.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="fourteen-storm-evac-table" data-id="100000009746891" data-source-id="100000009746891"><div data-sourceid="100000009746891" id="embed-id-100000009746891">
