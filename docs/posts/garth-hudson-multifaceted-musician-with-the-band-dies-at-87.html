He was 87 and the last surviving original member of the group.</p><p>His death, at a nursing home, was confirmed by Jan Haust, a close friend and colleague.</p><p>Mr. Hudson did far more than play the organ. A musical polymath whose work room at home included arcana like sheet music for century-old standards and hymns, he played almost anything — saxophone, accordion, synthesizers, trumpet, French horn, violin — and in endless styles that could at various times be at home in a conservatory, a church, a carnival or a roadhouse.</p><p>He was the one who set up, installed and maintained the recording equipment in the pink ranch house in Saugerties, N.Y., where Bob Dylan and the Band recorded more than 100 songs that came to be known as the basement tapes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>When the Band became a force on its own, he arranged the music on the group’s albums and painstakingly tweaked and honed its recordings. He added brass, woodwinds and eclectic flourishes that accentuated the group’s homespun authenticity, a quality that set it apart from the psychedelia and youthful posturing of the rock of its era.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Band in 1968.

But critics and his fellow band members agreed that Mr. Hudson played an essential role in raising the group to another level entirely.</p><p>Mr. Robertson, quoted in Barney Hoskyns’s 1993 book, “The Band: Across the Great Divide,” called him “far and away the most advanced musician in rock ’n’ roll.” “He could just as easily have played with John Coltrane or the New York Symphony Orchestra as with us,” Mr. Robertson said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Eric Garth Hudson was born on Aug. 2, 1937, in Windsor, Ontario. His mother, Olive Louella Pentland, played piano and accordion and sang. His father, Fred James Hudson, was a farm inspector, who played drums, C melody saxophone, clarinet flute and piano. The family moved to London, Ontario, when Garth was about 3.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He grew up listening to county hoedowns on the radio, learning Bach preludes and fugues and studying music theory, harmony and counterpoint. He first played in public at St. Luke’s Anglican Church and at an uncle’s funeral home, then began a musical career that took him, from 1961 to 1963, to Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, a boisterous rockabilly and rhythm-and-blues band that included the other four members of what would become the Band, three of them Canadians. Mr. Helm was from Arkansas.</p><p>According to Mr. Helm and others, Mr. Hudson had kept turning down pleas to join the Hawks until he was offered a new organ, an extra $10 a week to give the others music lessons and the title “music consultant” — all so that his parents would feel better about their gifted son playing mere rock ’n’ roll.</p><p>After leaving Mr. Hawkins, the former members of the Hawks toured on their own, and then with Mr. Dylan, who recruited them to accompany him on his groundbreaking 1965 and 1966 folk-rock tours. Afterward, they settled near Woodstock, where the collaborations with Mr. Dylan became the stuff of rock lore. (Known to the locals there as simply “the band,” the five decided to name themselves that.)</p><p>The Band recorded its first album, “Music From Big Pink,” in 1968. With the release of a follow-up, “The Band,” in 1969, the group’s distinctive mix of rock, r&amp;b and country became a phenomenon.</p><p>Songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLFAQuWFcTo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Weight,”</a> “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC-eDtV5O0Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGSf9kViEY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Up on Cripple Creek”</a> offered a rich, anachronistic distillation of diverse American musics, with echoes of the Civil War and the nation’s rural past. Mr. Hudson was the wizard behind the scenes adding pastoral touches to the band’s sound out of Aaron Copland or Charles Ives.</p><p>His dark beard and inscrutable expressions made him look somewhere between a dour lumberjack and an Old Testament prophet, giving him the appearance of serious craftsman lost in his music rather than a crowd-pleasing rock star. His musical influence was enhanced by the fact that he played the Lowrey organ, which had a richer tonal range than the Hammond used by most rock organists. Much of his work consisted of adding rich counterpoint and textures to the music while other members’ singing and playing were more in the forefront.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Still, a highlight of every show by the Band was his virtuoso improvisation leading into the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7qqnK0Q5hk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Chest Fever,”</a> which usually took off from Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor and veered off in whatever direction, from classical to jazz, Mr. Hudson had in mind that night — and at whatever length.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hudson played accordion (among other instruments) at “The Last Waltz,” the final concert by the original incarnation of the Band, at Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in 1976.

They disbanded in 1976 with an all-star Thanksgiving concert in San Francisco that included performances by Mr. Dylan, Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and others. The concert was documented in the Martin Scorsese film that took its title from how the evening was billed, “The Last Waltz.”</p><p>The Band, minus Mr. Robertson, reunited in the early 1980s. It toured and released three albums with additional musicians in the 1990s, though the group never again approached its early success.</p><p>Mr. Hudson continued to be sought after and widely admired, performing and recording with dozens of musicians, including Roger Waters, Leonard Cohen and Tom Petty.</p><p>For a group that captured so much of the depth and richness of the American experience, the lives of the Band’s members evoked much of its pain as well; several struggled with drugs, alcohol and financial ruin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Manuel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/06/obituaries/richard-manuel-40-rock-singer-and-pianist.html" title="">hanged himself</a> at age 42 while on tour with the reunited Band in 1986. Mr. Danko, who struggled with heroin addiction and health issues related to it, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/12/nyregion/rick-danko-56-a-groundbreaker-with-the-band-dies.html" title="">died in his sleep</a> at 56 in 1999. Mr. Helm, who overcame drug problems to become a beloved presence in Woodstock, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/arts/music/levon-helm-drummer-and-singer-dies-at-71.html" title="">died</a> from complications of cancer in 2012 at age 71. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/arts/music/robbie-robertson-dead.html" title="">Mr. Robertson died</a> of an unidentified illness in 2023 at 80.</p><p>Mr. Hudson suffered numerous financial setbacks, including several bankruptcies and a messy row with his landlord in Kingston, N.Y., who sold off much of Mr. Hudson’s personal property in 2013. Over the years his bushy black beard became a bushy white one, and he took on a stooped, genial, gnomelike presence around Woodstock, where he sometimes performed with his wife, the singer Sister Maud Hudson, who <a href="https://olpinmortuary.com/obituaries/maude-hudson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">died</a> in 2022 at 71. He left no immediate survivors.</p><p>Mr. Hudson mostly let his music speak for him. (One interviewer described his slow, careful manner of speech as “William Burroughs with long pauses.”) Still, his music and presence, captured in a video Rolling Stone made in 2014 when he returned to the basement of Big Pink for the first time since 1968, became the embodiment of a lost era when a little Catskills village became an international music mecca.</p><p>“Anybody who gets a chance to play with Garth Hudson, they’d be a fool not to,” Mr. Helm once said. “As far as the Band is concerned, he’s the one who rubbed off on the rest of us and made us sound as good as we did.”</p><p>Ash Wu contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Jan. 21, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this obituary misstated the age of Richard Manuel, a member of the Band, at his death. He was 42, not 40. (His obituary in The Times in 1986 erroneously reported that he was 40.)</p></div></div></div></article></div>
