The union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, represents more than 33,000 Boeing employees.</p><p>“Our business is in a difficult position, and it is hard to overstate the challenges we face together,” Mr. Ortberg said. “Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The cuts, which will include layoffs and not filling positions as employees leave, amount to a 10 percent reduction of Boeing’s 170,000 employees. Mr. Ortberg said that the cuts will be implemented across the company, affecting executives, managers and production workers.</p><p>Boeing announced a similarly large job cut in April 2020, when air travel fell about 90 percent as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. At the end of that year, Boeing employed 141,000.</p><p>Mr. Ortberg, a former top executive at Rockwell Collins, said Boeing would also change ts product lineup and adjust its schedule for selling new jets. It will do away with the 767 freighter, an older model, after fulfilling 29 outstanding orders. He also confirmed that the company would deliver its first 777X, a large plane designed for international travel that has been delayed repeatedly, in 2026, a year later than had previously been expected. When Boeing started the 777X program, in 2013, it slated the first delivery for 2020.</p><p>Mr. Ortberg also said that he expected additional losses from a handful of already-costly defense products that Boeing had agreed to build at a fixed price. Those programs have weighed heavily on the company’s finances in recent years, as supply chain challenges mounted and prices rose rapidly.</p><p>“We will refocus our company, and we will restore trust with all those who depend on us,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Ortberg’s appointment was part of a management shake-up in response to a crisis that began when a door panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. That episode renewed concerns about the quality and safety of Boeing’s planes several years after two fatal crashes involving the Max 8, a smaller version of the jet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In response, the Federal Aviation Administration limited production of all Max planes until it was convinced that the company had made sufficient quality improvements. Boeing has changed practices and increased training and oversight.</p><p>Talks between the company and the machinists’ union broke down this week, with Boeing retracting its latest contract offer and the two sides accusing one another of refusing to compromise. The strike is costing Boeing tens of millions of dollars a day.</p><p>Workers are seeking a 40 percent wage increase, restoration of a frozen pension and other changes. Many say they have grown frustrated by rising costs in the Seattle area and by company policies. They are also drawing inspiration from the success unions in other industries have seen in negotiations in recent years.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
