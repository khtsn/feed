Trump was watching television on Thursday night and he did not like what he saw.</p><p>His Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her allies were accusing him of groveling to dictators, imperiling democracy, and betraying American values.</p><p>So Mr. Trump picked up the telephone and called Fox News. The network patched him in to its live coverage of the Democratic convention — moments after Ms. Harris had deemed him, in her speech, “an unserious man” — and the former president proceeded to issue a meandering, stream-of-consciousness rebuttal.</p><p>Several times, the Fox anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum tried to interject to ask a question. Several times, Mr. Trump ignored them. “Mr. President, let me interrupt,” Mr. Baier pleaded at one point. Mr. Trump kept talking.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The call-in — which lasted for 10 minutes, until Fox News informed Mr. Trump that the network had run out of time — was hastily arranged. Network producers confirmed the interview less than a half-hour before Ms. Harris began her prime-time remarks.</p><p>Still, Mr. Trump did not want to wait until after the speech to weigh in. While Ms. Harris was speaking, he took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to provide real-time commentary.</p><p>His posts there, capitalized in a haphazard manner, were less directed at her specific remarks than at broader complaints about issues that Mr. Trump wants to keep the focus on: crime, immigration and the economy.</p><p>At times, he digressed.</p><p>“WHERE’S HUNTER?” Mr. Trump asked as Ms. Harris came onstage, reviving one of his favorite slogans about the son of President Biden, who withdrew his candidacy weeks ago.</p><p>At one point, referring to Ms. Harris, Mr. Trump asked, in all capital letters, “Is she talking about me?” (She was, often.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Trump also accused Ms. Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, of puffing up his résumé as a leader of a high school football team. “Walz was an ASSISTANT Coach, not a COACH,” he wrote.</p><p>A few minutes later, on Fox News, Mr. Trump argued that Ms. Harris had not accomplished much during her tenure as vice president.</p><p>“All of these things that she talked about — ‘We are going to do this, we are going to do that, we are going to do everything’ — but she didn’t do any of it!” Mr. Trump said on the air, complaining that “she didn’t talk about China, she didn’t talk about fracking, she didn’t talk about crime.”</p><p>His one concession? The Democrats’ convention hall. “It was a nice-looking room,” he said.</p><p>When Ms. MacCallum observed, accurately, that Ms. Harris was “having some success” with women, Hispanic and Black voters, Mr. Trump objected. “She’s not having success; I’m having success,” he said. “I’m doing great with the Hispanic voters, doing great with Black men, I’m doing great with women.”</p><p>“It’s only in your eyes that they have that, Martha,” he added. “We are doing very well.”</p><p>At several points during the call, a familiar beeping sound interrupted Mr. Trump’s remarks. It appeared that the former president was accidentally pressing buttons on the keypad of his phone.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Finally, while Mr. Trump was still midsentence, Mr. Baier moved to end the interview and thanked his guest for his time: “We appreciate that live feedback.”</p><p>The network immediately shifted to an episode of its late-night comedy program, “Gutfeld!”</p><p>The host, Greg Gutfeld, looked bemused. “That wasn’t my fault, Donald Trump,” he said, speaking to the president through the TV.</p><p>“He’s still talking, by the way,” Mr. Gutfeld joked.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
