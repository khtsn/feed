Last year, when the Yantar was first detected in Britain’s waters, a British submarine nearby was monitoring it, the defense secretary disclosed on Wednesday.</p><p>While the authorities have linked Russia’s intelligence services to vandalism, arson and assaults across Europe in recent years, threats at sea have generated the most anxiety and prompted the boldest responses. Last week, NATO announced it was deploying warships, patrol aircraft and drones to protect critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea after several undersea cables were cut, apparently by ships dragging their anchors along the sea floor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Suspicion has fallen on vessels linked to Russia and China, with European Union vessels <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/baltic-fiber-optic-cables-ship.html" title="">surrounding a Chinese-flagged ship</a> for weeks and Finland <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/europe/finland-estonia-cables-russia.html" title="">seizing an oil tanker</a> that experts and officials said might be part of Russian efforts to avoid Western sanctions. </p><p>Russian naval vessels have for years carried out missions near Britain and elsewhere. But Mr. Healey on Wednesday gave an unusual amount of detail about the normally shadowy world of military surveillance, underscoring the growing concern about Russian activity, in particular around vital underwater cables connecting Britain to continental Europe.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
