Not so much. The city went 15 years without measurable snow until Tuesday morning.</p><p>“I would call it a poet’s snow,” waxed Kevin Bennett, a writer who pulled a folding chair outside in the French Quarter to smoke a cigarette in the blur of whirling white flakes. “I love it.”</p><p>For the vulnerable, though, the bitter cold was a real danger. “It’s horrible, in its own beautiful way,” said Chad Rigsby, 52, after he pulled off the blanket he had slept under on Monday night.</p><p>Major highways and bridges were closed on Tuesday. Many roadways had become impassable. Classes were canceled in local schools, and many businesses could not open as the snow essentially brought New Orleans to a standstill. Officials warned residents to hunker down, since the snow was expected to continue into Tuesday evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Gov. Jeff Landry said the same entreaty applied to a vast swath of the state, as forecasters predicted levels of snowfall that could break records. “This creates a very dangerous situation, not only for travel but for people, pipes, pets and plants,” Mr. Landry, a Republican, said in a news conference on Monday.</p><p>Jay Grymes, a longtime television meteorologist in Baton Rouge who became the state climatologist last year, said the state had not experienced wintry conditions like this since the 1960s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rance Jefferson made a snow angel in the Bywater neighborhood, along the Mississippi.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kathleen Flynn for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Snow swirled around Andrew Jackson’s statue at the French Quarter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kathleen Flynn for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Mid-City neighborhood of New Orleans on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Kask for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Four inches or more of snow were expected across the state, from the border with Texas to the border with Mississippi. Mr. Grymes warned residents they should anticipate staying put until at least Wednesday and possibly into Thursday.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some of the rhythms of responding to hurricanes were evident during the snowstorm, like cooking up pots of gumbo and pans of fried chicken, and using up perishable foods in the refrigerator and freezer.</p><p>There were also fears about those exposed to the elements, particularly the homeless.</p><p>Joycelyn Scott, an outreach worker for Unity of Greater New Orleans, a group of agencies supporting the homeless, drove a van around the city, picking up some people who were eager for shelter and convincing others they needed to find somewhere safe. On Monday, she pleaded with a group of people sleeping on the steps of the main branch of the New Orleans Public Library.</p><p>“We are not accustomed to this kind of weather, this much snow,” Ms. Scott said.</p><p>On most nights, there would be 15 to 20 people sleeping out. By 9 p.m. Monday, she and her team had gotten it down to eight. A few had agreed to come inside after sleeping out on Sunday night, when temperatures dipped to 29 degrees.</p><p>But that experience had made Kelvin Easley, 54, feel more confident he could handle the conditions on his own. “It was very cold — very,” he said. “But I’m going to be all right.”</p><p>“You need a hat?” Ms. Scott asked, “Some socks?”</p><p>“A hat for me, over here?” asked one man, sticking his head out of a pile of blankets covered with a tarp.</p><p>“That’s all I needed,” he said. “Now let the snow come.”</p><p>Katy Reckdahl<!-- --> reported from New Orleans, and <!-- -->Rick Rojas<!-- --> from Atlanta. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rick Rojas is the Atlanta bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the South.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rick-rojas">More about Rick Rojas</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
