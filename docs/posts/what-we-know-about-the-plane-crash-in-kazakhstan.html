Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said there were “some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems.” </p><p>“That said, there’s an ongoing investigation right now,” he added. “Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are conducting this jointly. We have offered our assistance to that investigation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The plane, an Embraer 190 airliner operated by Azerbaijan Airlines, was traveling from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny, Russia, when it crashed on Wednesday on the shore of the Caspian Sea, near Aktau in Kazakhstan. Of the 67 people onboard, 38 died, including passengers and crew members. Most of the plane’s fuselage was severely burned.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As investigators focused on Russian air defenses as the probable cause of Wednesday’s crash, the aviation authorities in Moscow suggested a different culprit. In a statement on Friday, Russia said Ukrainian drone attacks might have played a role. But officials in Azerbaijan dispute that claim. </p><p>Rasim Musabayov, a member of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, said on Friday that all evidence pointed to the plane being damaged by a Russian missile. In addition to demanding an apology from Russia, Mr. Musabayov said Russia should explain why the damaged plane was not allowed to land at other Russian airports near Grozny.</p><p>“If someone thinks that we are allies with Russia and therefore we would close our eyes on everything, then they are mistaken,” Mr. Musabayov said in a phone interview. “There aren’t that many countries that are on good terms with Russia now,” he added. “If Moscow doesn’t make the right steps in this situation the list might get shorter.”</p><p>Here is what we know about the crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-55c29270">The plane was on a regular flight to Grozny.</h2><p>The Embraer 190 airliner was making a regular flight on Wednesday from Baku to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya in Russia, on the other side of the Caucasus Mountains. That morning, aerial battles between drones launched by Ukraine and Russian air defense systems were taking place in the area around Grozny and across the North Caucasus, according to residents and local news media reports.</p><p>Ukrainian military and intelligence officials have taken credit for a string of recent drone strikes aimed at Chechen military facilities in and around Grozny over the past month but did not comment on any specific attacks on the morning the plane crashed.</p><p>Once in Russian airspace, the plane stopped sending radar information. <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/azerbaijan-airlines-e190-crashes-near-aktau/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flightradar24</a>, a flight tracking service, <a href="https://x.com/flightradar24/status/1871853766191804673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the airliner had been subjected to GPS jamming near Grozny.</p><p>On Wednesday, Russian state news agencies, citing the airport in Grozny, reported that on approach to that city, the flight was diverted because of fog. Soon after the crash, the agencies cited the country’s state aviation authority statement that the plane had hit a flock of birds, causing it to attempt an emergency landing. Aviation experts cast doubt on that assertion, pointing to the military activity near the flight path at the time, and videos and images.</p><p>In Friday’s statement, the Russian authorities suggested that an order was made for all aircraft to leave the area around Grozny because of Ukrainian drone activity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-609bfe25">The plane had severe issues with altitude control.</h2><p>While on its approach to Aktau, on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, the plane again began to send radar information. That data suggested that the pilots struggled with altitude control. <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/azerbaijan-airlines-e190-crashes-near-aktau/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to Flightradar24</a>, a live flight tracker, data received from the plane showed that its vertical speed oscillated more than 100 times during the final 74 minutes of the journey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Experts suggested the plane probably was rendered uncontrollable because its electrical and hydraulic systems had been severely damaged.</p><p>“You see an airplane flying wild, wild maneuvers with strong fluctuations in the course and in the flight altitude,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heinrich-grossbongardt-06b4556/overlay/about-this-profile/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BLkhsvEHTTX6%2BGdzOCVPTuQ%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heinrich Grossbongardt</a>, an aviation industry expert in Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>Kazakhstan’s transportation minister, Marat Karabayev, said the plane had experienced a major failure in its control systems before it entered his country’s airspace, according to Kazinform, a state news agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-3b9c9e53">Investigators are focusing on Russian air defense.</h2><p>In Azerbaijan, investigators believe that a Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system damaged the plane, according to two people in Baku who were briefed on the inquiry and spoke anonymously because the investigation was ongoing.</p><p>On Friday, Azerbaijan Airlines <a href="https://t.me/AzerbaijanAirlines/2037" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it had suspended regular flights to eight Russian cities. It also said that based on the preliminary results of the Azerbaijani investigation, the plane had suffered “physical and technical external interference.” It has stopped flights to Makhachkala in neighboring Dagestan as well.</p><p>Rashad Nabiyev, Azerbaijan’s transportation minister, told the country’s state-run news agency APA on Friday that the plane crashed because of “external interference.”</p><p>“However, it will be up to investigators to determine what kind of weapon did that,” Mr. Nabiyev said. He added that surviving passengers told investigators that they heard an explosion while they were flying above Grozny, and that one of the flight attendants was injured.</p><p>Russian pro-military bloggers have also pointed a finger at Russian air defenses. Yuri Podolyaka, a popular blogger, said in <a href="https://t.me/yurasumy/20097" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post</a> on Telegram on Wednesday that the airplane most likely had been “incidentally shot down by an air defense system.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>According to a <a href="https://t.me/fighter_bomber/19310" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> verified by The New York Times, the tail section of the aircraft was peppered with dozens of small holes. </p><p>The Russian authorities have said that the plane had been diverted from its original path and have offered differing explanations for why, including that the flight was diverted because of fog and that the plane was hit by birds.</p><p>But in a statement on Friday, the head of Rosaviatsia, the Russian aviation agency, said that as the airliner had been heading toward Grozny, the city’s infrastructure was being attacked by Ukrainian drones. Because of the attack, he said, an order was made for all aircraft to leave the affected airspace and that the Azerbaijani jet made two failed attempts to land in Grozny. </p><p><a href="https://x.com/99Dominik_/status/1872307332409131316" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Three</a> <a href="https://x.com/99Dominik_/status/1871978786654400577" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">videos</a> <a href="https://x.com/blinzka/status/1872301080169885737" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">geolocated</a> by online analysts and verified by The Times show between one and three drones flying southwest of Grozny on Wednesday morning in roughly the same area and time as the Azerbaijan Airlines jet.</p><p>“The pilot was offered other airports,” said Dmitri Yadrov, the head of Russia’s aviation agency. “He decided to fly to Aktau.”</p><p>Representatives of the airline did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia cannot “offer any theories until the investigation comes up with some results.”</p><p>Marc Santora<!-- -->, <!-- -->Helene Cooper<!-- --> and <!-- -->Riley Mellen<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
