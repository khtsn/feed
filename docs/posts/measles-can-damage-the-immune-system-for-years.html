    <h1>Measles Can Damage the Immune System for Years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“A real concern is you’re not just going to get measles and get sick, but within the next couple of years, your kid’s going to be really vulnerable to a lot of other stuff,” said Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.</p><p>Measles can also cause severe, long-term complications. About one in 1,000 children who develop measles will experience brain swelling, which can cause hearing and vision loss, intellectual disabilities and permanent brain damage. And people of any age <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/well/immunocompromised-disease.html" title="">who are immunocompromised</a> are at greater risk for developing a <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/114/5/e657/67706/A-New-Complication-of-Stem-Cell-Transplantation?redirectedFrom=PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific type of brain swelling</a> that can occur for up to a year after they recover, said Dr. Milstone.</p><p>In extremely rare cases, adults and children develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a fatal disease of the central nervous system. That disease, which can cause seizures, typically appears seven to 10 years after a patient has recovered from measles. There is no cure. By <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/#:~:text=%5B5%5D%20Generally%2C%204%20to,when%20primarily%20infected%20with%20measles." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some estimates,</a> around four to eleven per 100,000 cases of measles lead to the condition. The risk is slightly higher among children who are infected under the age of 5.</p><p>Around one out of every 20 children with measles develops pneumonia. The lung infection is the most common cause of death in children with measles. Even in children who survive, a severe case of pneumonia can impair lung function in the long term, said Saad Omer, a professor of public health at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The illness can scar the lungs, making it difficult to breathe properly. Children who develop pneumonia may also be more likely to develop asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as adults.</p><p>Most measles cases in the United States this year have been among children. But adults are also susceptible to long-term effects and severe infections. </p></div></div>
