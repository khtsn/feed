Lively streets were turned into scenes of carnage: Video of the aftermath showed mangled and bloodied bodies laying motionless, burning cars and debris covering the road as screams and sirens wailed in the background.</p><p>Two children were among the dead and at least 99 people were wounded, according to <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/41118" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukraine’s emergency services</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“People were harmed right in the middle of the street — in cars, on public transport, in their homes,” the interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, <a href="https://t.me/Klymenko_MVS/1381" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lamented on social media</a>.</p><p>The strikes came just over a week after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html" title="">Russian missile hit near a playground in the central city of Kryvyi Rih</a>, killing 19 people, including nine children. In that attack and in the one on Sunday, according to Ukrainian officials, Russia used ballistic missiles, which travel at high speeds, making them very difficult to shoot down.</p><p>Overall, civilian deaths have increased since U.S.-mediated cease-fire talks began in March. The United Nations <a href="https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-04/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28March%202025%29_ENG.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last week that 164 civilians were killed in Ukraine last month, a 50 percent increase from February and 70 percent more than the same period a year earlier.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Officials said that more than 80 people were also injured in the attack.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oleg Voronenko/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine — who has accused Russia of using the cease-fire talks to stall for time — said the attack on Sumy showed that Moscow had no real interest in a cease-fire despite the Trump administration’s efforts to broker one.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“A strong reaction from the world is needed. From the United States, from Europe, from everyone in the world who wants this war and the killings to end,” Mr. Zelensky said in a <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/13853" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message posted on Telegram</a>. “Russia seeks exactly this kind of terror and is dragging out the war.”</p><p>Both Russia and Ukraine have pledged to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/europe/russia-ukraine-power-energy-grid.html" title="">only to accuse each other</a> of violations. Kyiv and Moscow have also agreed to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-deal-black-sea.html" title="">cease-fire on the Black Sea</a>, but a deal has yet to come into effect. Russia has also rejected a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire that Ukraine had accepted at the urging of the United States.</p><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said on Saturday that since cease-fire talks began last month in Saudi Arabia, Russia “only escalated its attacks on Ukrainian civilian objects and increased missile terror, including strikes on energy facilities.”</p><p>“This is Russia’s response to all peace proposals,” Mr. Sybiha told the state news agency <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3981455-sybiha-says-attacks-on-ukraine-after-jeddah-meeting-are-russias-response-to-peace-proposals.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrinform</a>. “They delay, manipulate, and play with their partners to continue aggression.”</p><p><a href="https://x.com/italyinukr/status/1911414102766854265?s=46&amp;t=cW1NbGMcm2NQdLE2hWoF2w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukraine’s</a> <a href="https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1911404868595523593" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allies</a> echoed those sentiments on Sunday in what appeared to be a coordinated response to condemn the strike on Sumy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Everyone knows: this war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it — with blatant disregard for human lives, international law, and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump,” President Emmanuel Macron of France <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1911380883489141039" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on social media.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Russia’s military about the attack on Sumy, located just 18 miles from the Russian border. Before the war, the city was home to about 250,000 people. It has since become a refuge for Ukrainian civilians fleeing villages and towns along the Russian border to escape bombardment and potential assaults.</p><p>Sumy and its surrounding region have regularly come under Russian attack over the past year, particularly since Ukraine used the area as a base for a cross-border offensive into Russia’s neighboring Kursk region. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/world/europe/ukraine-kursk-retreat-russia.html" title="">Moscow’s forces pushed most Ukrainian troops out of Kursk this year</a>, but Kyiv has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-top-general-says-russia-intensifies-actions-ukraines-sumy-region-2025-03-27/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that Russia is preparing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">push into the Sumy region</a> and open a new front in the war.</p><p>Valeria Voronenko, a 24-year-old Sumy resident, rushed to the scene of the strike on Sunday. She said she had seen one woman running around, searching for her mother, and another clutching a crying child — both with bloodied faces.</p><p>“The whole atmosphere — people shouting, crying,” she said. “It was chaos.”</p><p>Ms. Voronenko said locals had grown accustomed to attacks and the buzz of Russian drone flying overhead, but that Sunday’s assault was “the worst tragedy” the city had experienced over three years of war.</p><p>“We’re hoping for negotiations,” she said, “for everything to end.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
