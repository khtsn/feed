Her résumé includes time as the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/omd/bios/mns.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deputy managing director</a> of the International Monetary Fund and as the deputy governor of the Bank of England, and she has also served in the British House of Lords, the upper chamber of Parliament.</p><p>Like leaders at other American universities, she contended in recent months with dueling protests, reports of antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus and questions of whether pro-Palestinian supporters have been unfairly silenced.</p><p>On Wednesday, she announced her resignation. Here is a timeline of Dr. Shafik’s tenure at the university:</p><p><strong>Jan. 18, 2023</strong></p><p>The university’s board of trustees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/us/columbia-president-nemat-shafik.html" title="">announces</a> that Dr. Shafik, then the president of the London School of Economics and Political Science, will be the 20th president of Columbia.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>July 1, 2023</strong></p><p>Soon after Dr. Shafik’s first day as president, July 1, she tells <a href="https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/get-know-minouche-shafik-columbias-twentieth-president" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Columbia Magazine</a> that her leadership philosophy centers on leading from behind when possible. “Occasionally, you need to step out in front and point an institution in a different direction,” she says.</p><p>She continues: “But most of the time, if you’re working with great people, you can allow your colleagues to flourish and take things where they need to go. I find that this works well at universities, where you’ve got immensely talented individuals all around you.”</p><p><strong>Oct. 4, 2023</strong></p><p>Dr. Shafik is <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/inauguration" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inaugurated</a> as president, though it is not entirely a celebratory affair, the student newspaper, The Columbia Daily Spectator, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/10/04/shafik-inaugurated-as-20th-university-president-in-ceremony-that-draws-hundreds-of-protesters/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.

Their lawyerly answers draw strong criticism.</p><p>Dr. Shafik does not attend the hearing because of a previous commitment at United Nations climate talks in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.</p><p><strong>April 17</strong></p><p>After the December congressional hearing, two of the campus leaders who testified, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/01/02/us/claudine-gay-harvard" title="">Claudine Gay of Harvard</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/us/university-of-pennsylvania-president-resigns.html" title="">Elizabeth Magill of Penn</a>, resigned under pressure.</p></div></div><div><div><p>When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/17/us/shafik-statement-document.html" title="">Dr. Shafik testifies</a> before the same Republican-led House committee, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/nyregion/columbia-university-president-nemat-shafik-hearing.html" title="">tells</a> lawmakers that she is taking serious action to what she and university officials call a wave of antisemitism on campus.</p><p>She frequently defends Columbia’s commitment to free speech while saying that administrators “cannot and should not tolerate abuse of this privilege” when it puts others at risk. She also appears much more willing than the leaders of Harvard and Penn were to condemn and potentially discipline students and faculty.</p><p>On the same day, dozens of students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/nyregion/columbia-university-campus-protests.html" title="">pitch tents</a> on a lawn in the center of Columbia’s Manhattan campus.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters occupied a part of Columbia’s campus on April 17.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>April 18</strong></p><p>In short order, Dr. Shafik sends a letter to the N.Y.P.D., saying that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/nyregion/columbia-university-tent-city-palestinian-protest.html" title="">pop-up tent village</a> “and related disruptions pose a clear and present danger” to the university.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“With great regret, we request the NYPD’s help to remove these individuals,” Dr. Shafik <a href="https://publicsafety.columbia.edu/content/letter-nypd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>. More than 100 students at Columbia University and its sister school, Barnard College, are arrested. They were seeking that the university and its nearly $14 billion <a href="https://endowment.giving.columbia.edu/endowment-performance-and-management/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endowment</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/business/college-protesters-divestment-israel.html" title="">divest</a> from Israel.</p><p>There are no reports of violence or injury.</p><p><strong>April 19</strong></p><p>Tents are again set up on an adjacent campus lawn by demonstrators. All of the students involved in the first encampment are informed that they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/nyregion/arrested-columbia-students-suspended.html" title="">suspended</a> and some are evicted from campus housing.</p><p><strong>April 22</strong></p><p>Dr. Shafik <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/us/columbia-university-protests-classes.html" title="">announces</a> that all classes will be held virtually, and that faculty and staff should work remotely if possible. “We need a reset,” Dr. Shafik <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/statement-columbia-university-president-minouche-shafik-4-22" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> in a letter to the Columbia community.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On April 22, some Columbia faculty members staged a walkout in support of student protesters who had been arrested and suspended.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">C.S.

He says that Dr. Shafik should resign if she cannot immediately get the situation under control. At the same time, she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/us/columbia-protests-encampment.html" title="">fights</a> for her job during an hourlong meeting with the university senate, made up of faculty, administrators and students.</p><p>Columbia’s board of trustees says in a statement that it “strongly supports President Shafik as she steers the university through this extraordinarily challenging time.”</p><p><strong>April 26</strong></p><p>Columbia’s senate adopts a resolution, by a vote of 62-14 with three abstentions, that calls for an investigation of the university’s leadership. It also accuses the administration of violating established protocols, undermining academic freedom, jeopardizing free inquiry and breaching the due process rights of both students and professors.</p><p>Dr. Shafik and other Columbia leaders signal a reluctance to bring in the police again, writing in a statement that such a move would be “counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community.”</p><p><strong>April 29</strong></p><p>Columbia warns it will suspend students who remain in the encampment and refuse a limited, conditional offer of amnesty. After a deadline passes, Columbia begins imposing suspensions.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>April 30</strong></p><p>In the early morning hours, a group of protesters seize Hamilton Hall. Columbia further tightens access to its campus, barring anyone who is not an essential employee or a resident of one of seven residence halls.</p><p>Hours later, Dr. Shafik writes to the N.Y.P.D. and, “with the utmost regret, asks the police to return to campus. Officers march onto the campus around nightfall and begin making arrests.</p><p><strong>May 3</strong></p><p>Dr. Shafik speaks directly to students in a <a href="https://vimeo.com/942370647?share=copy&amp;utm_source=44059355_474850428&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=1633078204_NEW" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> message, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/us/columbia-nemat-shafik-video.html" title="">imploring</a> them to work together to return civility to the campus.</p><p>“We have a lot to do,” she says, “but I am committed to working at it, every day and with each of you, to rebuild community on our campus.”</p><p><strong>May 6</strong></p><p>The university <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/nyregion/columbia-commencement-cancel-protests.html" title="">cancels its main commencement ceremony</a>, citing security concerns.</p><p><strong>May 16</strong></p><p>The Faculty of Arts and Sciences <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/nyregion/president-shafik-columbia-faculty-vote.html" title="">passes</a> a largely symbolic resolution of no confidence in Dr. Shafik, criticizing her request to the police to clear the encampment on April 18, after the executive committee of the university senate had unanimously told her not to do it.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>July 8</strong></p><p>Dr. Shafik <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/nyregion/columbia-university-deans-antisemitism.html" title="">announces</a> that three deans have been removed from their posts after sending text messages that she said had “disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.” She says the three will remain employed by Columbia.</p><p><strong>Aug. 8</strong></p><p>Columbia says the three deans who sent the disparaging text messages are resigning. </p><p><strong>Aug. 14</strong></p><p>Dr. Shafik announces her resignation. In a letter to the Columbia community, she said she would join the administration of the new British prime minister, Keir Starmer, to lead a review of the government’s approach to international development for the foreign secretary.</p><p>Dr. Katrina Armstrong, a medical doctor who is the chief executive officer of Columbia’s medical center and dean of its medical school, will become the interim president, the school’s board of trustees said.</p><p>Alan Blinder<!-- --> and <!-- -->Claire Fahy<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan is a reporter and editor on the National Desk.
