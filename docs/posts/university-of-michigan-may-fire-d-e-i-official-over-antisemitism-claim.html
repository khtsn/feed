She was accused of saying in a conversation at a conference in March that the university was “controlled by wealthy Jews,” according to documents obtained by The New York Times through a freedom of information request.</p><p>She was also accused of saying that Jewish students were “wealthy and privileged” and not in need of her office’s diversity services, and that “Jewish people have no genetic DNA that would connect them to the land of Israel,” according to the documents, which were part of a complaint from the Anti-Defamation League of Michigan.</p><p>Fallout over the episode has been playing out behind the scenes at a moment when the campus is also on edge following vandalism, including pro-Palestinian graffiti, at the home of a Board of Regents member who is Jewish. The school’s campus in Ann Arbor has also faced student protests over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/university-of-michigan-dei.html" title="">plans to roll back</a> some diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>According to emails obtained The Times, university leaders had planned on a lesser punishment for Ms. Dawson, but a regent argued that she should be fired.</p><p>Ms. Dawson, who has been in her current job just over a year, is now on leave. The office of academic multicultural initiatives <a href="https://oami.umich.edu/what-we-do/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oversees efforts</a> to mentor and retain racially, culturally and economically diverse students.</p><p>A lawyer for Ms. Dawson has denied that she said anything antisemitic. The lawyer said the university had told her that it was contemplating firing Ms. Dawson, which she argued was inappropriate and raised First Amendment questions.</p><p>“It’s deeply troubling that they would escalate the situation to termination based on one conversation in somebody’s private capacity,” said the lawyer, Amanda Ghannam.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>After the Anti-Defamation League of Michigan sent a letter to the university in August with the allegations, the school brought in an outside law firm, Covington &amp; Burling, to investigate. The firm reported its findings in a memorandum that was obtained by The Times through an open records request.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Near the University of Michigan campus, in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sylvia Jarrus for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The law firm’s memo said it was “not possible to determine with certainty whether Ms. Dawson made the exact remarks” because “there is no recording of the conversation and no witness other than the reporting parties and the subject of the investigation.”</p><p>But the memo, dated Sept. 25, went on to conclude that the “weight of the available evidence supports A.D.L. Michigan’s report.”</p><p>Covington &amp; Burling has worked with the A.D.L. before, including on a <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/brandeis-centeradlstandwithus-launch-pro-bono-k-12-antisemitism-helpline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">help line</a> to provide pro bono legal assistance to parents whose children experience antisemitism.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the University of Michigan, Colleen Mastony, said the university would not comment on personnel matters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The allegations arose in March at a diversity conference in Philadelphia, sponsored by the American Association of Colleges and Universities. Two professors who attended the event, Naomi Yavneh Klos, who teaches at Loyola University New Orleans, and another Jewish professor said they had heard about the “negative experience” of a University of Michigan Jewish student, Dr. Yavneh Klos said in an interview.</p><p>When they learned that a Michigan D.E.I. administrator was at the conference, they decided to approach her, Dr. Yavneh Klos said.</p><p>“I think my colleague wanted to know, ‘Does the D.E.I. office work with these students?’” Dr. Yavneh Klos said. “‘Should the student go to the D.E.I. office?’ She said no. Jewish students are all rich. They don’t need us. That was the gist of what she said. It was really horrifying.”</p><p>She said she was so upset after the conversation that she called a friend who works for the Anti-Defamation League, who encouraged her to file a report, which Dr. Yavneh Klos did that same day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Last week, about 100 students and faculty members protested before a Board of Regents meeting amid concerns that the board would roll back its diversity initiatives.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Elconin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>According to the Covington &amp; Burling memo, Ms. Dawson confirmed that she spoke to the two professors, but she gave a different version of the conversation. Rather than claiming Jews had no ancestral claim to Israel, for example, she said she had pointed out that Jews and Palestinians shared an ancestral connection to the region.</p><p>The university’s response to the allegations has been unusual in several ways, according to Ms. Ghannam, who suggested that it was rare to bring in an outside law firm to investigate a lower level official. She also said the university’s move to terminate Ms. Dawson, against the recommendations of her superior, was unusual.</p><p>Emails obtained by The Times suggested that the move to oust Ms. Dawson might have been influenced by a member of the Michigan Board of Regents, the university’s governing board.</p><p>Jon Kinsey, a university vice president, wrote to the regents in October on behalf of the president’s office to inform them that Ms. Dawson had been issued a written warning that additional incidents could result in termination, and that she would have to undergo training in antisemitism and leadership, according to the emails.</p><p>The next day, Mark Bernstein, a regent, wrote to campus officials, including the president, Santa Ono, saying that he was “disgusted” with the university’s response, according to the emails.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It does not appear that Ms. Dawson has been held accountable in any meaningful way,” Mr. Bernstein wrote. “Of course, this makes a mockery of your/our commitment to address antisemitism and broaden our D.E.I. efforts to include antisemitism and/or Jewish students.”</p><p>Mr. Bernstein wrote that the only acceptable outcome would be for Ms. Dawson to be “terminated immediately.”</p><p>Ms. Dawson was notified on Oct. 28 that the earlier lesser disciplinary action was being revised, according to her lawyer.</p><p>Disciplining Ms. Dawson for her speech could be complicated at Michigan, which, as a public university, is subject to the First Amendment. Geoffrey Stone, a constitutional law scholar at the University of Chicago, said that speech by government employees enjoyed broad protections when not made in an official capacity. The institution would have to prove that the speech “substantially undermines the ability of the individual to perform her responsibilities as an employee,” he said</p><p>Even if she had made the comments, “her speech would be protected by the First Amendment,” Professor Stone said in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Dr. Yavneh Klos said she was a “tremendous advocate for D.E.I.” But one of her frustrations with colleges, she added, was that “the current D.E.I. narrative very often excludes Jews” even as “antisemitism is still very much present.”</p><p>“D.E.I. offices very frequently fail to serve the needs of Jewish students, and don’t really recognize Jewish students as under their purview,” she said.</p><p>The campus is currently reckoning with a series of episodes in which Jewish people have complained that they are being targeted. On Monday, a regent, Jordan Acker, and his family awoke to the sound of two Mason jars filled with what appeared to be urine being thrown through a front window of their home. A family car was painted with an inverted red triangle — which symbolizes Palestinian resistance, and which some Jews see as an antisemitic symbol — and the words “divest” and “free Palestine.”</p><p>It was the third time Mr. Acker, who is Jewish, had been <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/news/umich-regent-jordan-ackers-home-car-damaged-in-third-vandalism-incident/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">targeted</a> by protesters.</p><p>The campus is also facing upheaval over its diversity programs. Last week, about 100 students and faculty members <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/news/administration/students-and-faculty-march-in-support-of-dei-outside-regents-meeting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">protested</a> before the Michigan Board of Regents meeting amid concerns that the board would roll back its diversity initiatives.</p><p>Nicholas Confessore<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephanie-saul">More about Stephanie Saul</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
