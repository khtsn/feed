But it prompted a 47-page report by the Justice Department’s civil rights division, which found that residents were routinely jailed on illegal “investigative holds” or for unpaid fines, and that they faced excessive force, sexual harassment, retaliation when they criticized the police and racial discrimination.</p><p>So intent were officers on collecting fines, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1370761/dl?inline=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said the report released on Thursday</a>, that body camera videos showed them brainstorming additional charges such as “disturbing a business” for a man who ran into the police station to escape a beating. (He was charged with disturbing the peace.)</p><p>The report was released after a 10-month investigation, and comes nine years after the Justice Department placed the Police Department in Ferguson, Mo., under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/us-calls-on-ferguson-to-overhaul-criminal-justice-system.html" title="">federal oversight</a>, in part because of a similar focus on raising revenue at the expense of respecting constitutional rights.</p><p>In Lexington, the Justice Department said, more than half of the residents had a warrant for unpaid fines and fees, making them subject to arrest. “Going into town for any reason can mean going to jail,” the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Over the past two years, the Lexington police have made one arrest for every four residents, many of them for noncriminal conduct like using profanity, the Justice Department said. After one woman came in to give a witness statement in a murder investigation, the police arrested her for unpaid fines.</p><p>“After an extensive review, we found that police officers in Lexington routinely make illegal arrests, use brutal and unnecessary force and punish people for their poverty — including by jailing people who cannot afford to pay fines or money bail,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the civil rights division. “For too long, the Lexington Police Department has been playing by its own rules and operating with impunity. It’s time for this to end.”</p><p>A receptionist who answered the phone at Lexington’s City Hall said no one was available to comment on the investigation’s findings. The police chief, Charles Henderson, did not return a call for comment, nor did the city’s lawyer.</p><p>The report also comes eight years after the Justice Department warned Ville Platte, La., that it <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-investigation-ville-platte-louisiana-police-department" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could not imprison people</a> on “investigative holds” without probable cause. In Lexington, the report said, one woman was held on an investigative hold for five days while the police lied to obtain a search warrant for her home.</p><p>The Justice Department has rarely, if ever, focused on such a small department. But Ms. Clarke has said that rural Americans have the same constitutional rights as city dwellers, and the report notes that nearly half of the nation’s 18,000 police departments have fewer than 10 officers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>About 75 percent of Lexington’s residents are Black, as are the current police chief and a majority of the town’s aldermen and officers. The previous police chief, who was white, was fired two years ago after being recorded uttering a racial slur, the report said.</p><p>The report said that the Lexington police responded to low-level offenses with force and aggression that are usually reserved for serious crimes.</p><p>It cited examples including breaking down the door of a 63-year-old man to arrest him for calling a woman a “bitch” in a public place, and slamming a man with an open container of alcohol against a car. The report offers multiple examples of what it called illegal use of Tasers, including Chief Henderson’s shocking a man in the heart when he responded to a command too slowly, multiple officers using Tasers like cattle prods on a Black woman, and using a Taser nine times on a man who had a behavioral health disability and was accused of disturbing a business.</p><p>“In all the incidents we reviewed, we never saw L.P.D. use force against a white person. We only saw L.P.D. use force against Black people,” the report said.</p><p>Investigators found that people were charged fees in order to be released from custody, regardless of their guilt or ability to pay, and that many people paid their fines directly to the Police Department, which automatically results in a guilty plea being entered in the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2022, the Police Department enacted a policy of aggressive arrests, the report said. The city’s revenue from fines increased more than sevenfold — to over $220,000 in 2023, from $30,000.</p><p>“In a town of about 1,200 people, the total sum of outstanding fines is more than $1.7 million,” the report said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shaila Dewan covers criminal justice — policing, courts and prisons — across the country.
