That doesn’t mean that politics is independent of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Today, America’s central bank will almost certainly cut borrowing costs from a two-decade high. More cuts are likely before the end of the year. The reason is economic: Inflation has come down from its 2022 peak, and unemployment has climbed. The Fed doesn’t need to squeeze the economy as tightly as it did to bring prices under control. Also, keeping rates too high for too long could seriously hurt the job market.</p><p>But cutting borrowing costs right now — just weeks before the election — pushes Fed officials into the middle of a political battle they would prefer to avoid. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, says a rate cut before the election would be a bid to help Democrats. And while President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have both mostly avoided talking about the Fed, other prominent Democrats have called for lower borrowing costs; it would help the economy on their watch.</p><p>Central bankers say they ignore the political calendar when they weigh their decisions. They have the freedom to do that: Because Fed officials do not answer to the White House, they have the independence to make decisions — even politically unpopular ones — based solely on inflation and employment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But that won’t stop politicians from turning the Fed into a talking point. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain why.</p><h2 id="link-8fdca4e">Election booster</h2><p>Independence is important to the Fed. Back in the 1970s, it seemed to bend to pressure from the Nixon White House as it kept interest rates too low for too long. That mistake helped to drive runaway inflation, and it has haunted central bankers ever since.</p><p>Today, Fed officials believe they should ignore the political cycle and focus on the economic fundamentals. Those fundamentals suggest it’s now time to cut interest rates. Outside economists agree; some even think that officials have waited too long.</p><p>But lowering borrowing costs this close to an election inevitably injects the Fed into the campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jerome Powell testifying before a Senate committee.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>That’s because rate cuts tend to help the party in power. Lower interest rates boost the economy by making it cheaper for people to borrow money to buy a house or start a business. And while the full benefits take time, cutting borrowing costs can shift America’s economic vibe quickly.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cutting rates sends a clear signal: America is beating inflation. Given how much Americans hate inflation — in polls, they say it is a top concern this November — that’s welcome news for the U.S. consumer. Already, mortgage rates are coming down, and expectations for lower rates have helped to lift stocks.</p><p>All of that explains why voters and the politicians who court them prefer low rates. Many presidents — including Harry Truman, Nixon, Lyndon Johnson and Trump — pushed for lower rates. And some incumbents, including George H.W. Bush, blamed high interest rates for costing them re-election.</p><h2 id="link-1f673a6e">Nonpartisan, but not perfect</h2><p>Fed officials realize that rates affect politics, but they face a dilemma. If they cut rates as expected, Republicans can accuse them of helping Democrats. But if they hold off until after the election, Democrats can accuse them of the reverse. Officials think that their best option is to pay no attention to the political calendar.</p><p>“I can’t say it enough: We just don’t go down that road,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said earlier this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But setting policy based on data doesn’t guarantee that the Fed will make the right policy choices. After all, guiding the economy is more of an art than a science. How much should the Fed adjust rates to protect the economy? It is not always clear, and officials simply make their best guesses.</p><p>This time, the Fed could make one of two big mistakes. It could cut interest rates too abruptly, which would speed up the economy and keep inflation high. Given that risk, some economists think that officials will cut interest rates by a cautious quarter-point today. That’s like taking a foot off the brake, but just a little.</p><p>The other risk is lowering rates too slowly and tanking the job market. Already, some economists point to a slowdown in hiring and a pickup in the unemployment rate as signs that the Fed might be falling behind. A larger-than-usual half-point rate cut this afternoon could cushion the job market against further slowdown.</p><p>It’s difficult to know today which path will look best in hindsight. But whatever the Fed chooses, one thing is certain: Politicians will be watching.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/business/fed-rates-mortgages-car-loans.html" title="">See what rate cuts mean for everyday finances</a> — car loans, credit cards, mortgages, savings and student loans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-6dd88b5b">Pager Attack</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Beirut, Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Wael Hamzeh/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Hundreds of pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/17/world/israel-hamas-war-news/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share" title="">exploded at the same time</a> across Lebanon and in Syria. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html?smid=url-share" title="">See a video</a>.</p></li><li><p>The blasts killed 11 people and injured more than 2,700, Lebanese officials said.</p></li><li><p>Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-planted-explosives-in-pagers-sold-to-hezbollah-officials-say.html?smid=url-share" title="">appeared to be behind the attack</a>: Its operatives hid explosive material in a shipment of pagers before they arrived in Lebanon, American and other officials said, with a switch to detonate them remotely.</p></li><li><p>The pagers received a message at 3:30 p.m. that appeared to be from Hezbollah’s leadership, officials said.
