    <h1>Yemeni Missile Lands in Tel Aviv</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.</p><p>Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>While military analysts widely deem the Houthis less powerful than other Iran-backed militias — like Hezbollah in Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza — they have managed to penetrate Israel’s defenses multiple times. In July, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html" title="">a Houthi drone attack</a> killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, prompting Israeli airstrikes on the port of Hudaydah in western Yemen.</p><p>On Thursday, a school in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan was damaged after a missile fired overnight from Yemen was partly intercepted, <a href="https://t.me/idfofficial/13237" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Israeli military said</a>. At least three people were wounded by broken glass, according to Magen David Adom, but no one was seriously injured or killed.</p><p>The Houthis have also attacked cargo vessels passing through the Red Sea in an attempt to enforce a commercial embargo on Israel. That has prompted international condemnation and a campaign of airstrikes by the United States and its allies against them.</p></div></div>
