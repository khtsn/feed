In some cases, crucial parts may be produced by only a few manufacturers or just one. The aerospace industry is expected to export about $125 billion this year, <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry-trends/biggest-exporting-industries/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to IBISWorld</a>, second only to oil and gas.</p><p>“Our record of trade surpluses, job creation and innovative contributions to both air transport and national defense is the best news story for the American economy among all manufacturing sectors,” Eric Fanning, the president of the Aerospace Industries Association, said in a statement. “We look forward to engaging with the Department of Commerce to identify opportunities to strengthen our domestic supply chain while also maintaining the trade framework that has enabled our global leadership in aerospace.”</p><p>Boeing, which makes commercial airplanes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/boeing-earnings-china-trump.html" title="">recently described the direct effects of the tariffs that Mr. Trump had imposed so far as minor</a>, but said it was concerned about the toll they could have on its suppliers. The company’s chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, told Wall Street analysts last month that Boeing was paying 10 percent tariffs on components for wide-body jets imported from Japan and Italy, but that the company expected to recover those costs when the planes were sold.</p><p>RTX, which makes plane engines and parts, estimated last month that tariffs this year would cost it $850 million. GE Aerospace, another engine maker, said it expected $500 million in tariff costs this year.</p><p>Governments have often tried to protect and nurture their aviation industries with tariffs and subsidies. The United States and the European Union quarreled for many years over whether the other was providing unfair subsidies to Boeing and Airbus, the world’s largest makers of commercial planes. Airbus is based in France and has extensive operations in several European countries.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Toyota’s Somber Outlook:</strong> The automaker’s forecast for the fiscal year underscored <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/business/toyota-earnings-trump-tariffs.html">how quickly fortunes had turned</a> for many companies reckoning with President Trump’s tariffs.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-U.K. Trade Agreement:</strong> Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spent months nurturing his relationship with Trump.
