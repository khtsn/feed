    <h1>Biden Commuted the Sentences of 1,500 Americans, a One-Day Record</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Biden announced today that he would pardon 39 people convicted of nonviolent crimes and commute the sentences of 1,499 others. The White House said it was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/biden-pardons-commutes-1500.html" title="">largest number of commutations by an American president in a single day</a>.</p><p>The act of clemency targeted those who had been released from prison and placed in home confinement during the pandemic. Recipients include people who were convicted of drug crimes, Medicare fraud and illegally prescribing opioids. Some were convicted as young adults only to serve in the military, help charities or train local firefighters.</p><p>In a statement, Biden said that many of the people would have received lower sentences if they had been charged under current laws. “America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,” he said.</p><p>Some Democrats have called on Biden to reduce the sentences of all 40 people on death row to life without parole because Donald Trump supports the death penalty. Members of Biden’s staff have been debating whether he should issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/biden-trump-pardons.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">blanket pardons</a> for a number of Trump’s perceived enemies to protect them from retribution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rioters storm the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-70a40921">Trump said he’d begin his term with Jan. 6 pardons</h2><p>Donald Trump promised to start pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/trump-pardons-deportations-time-magazine-interview.html" title="">during the “first hour” he returns to office</a>. He also said he would use his first day to begin deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Trump’s comments were published today in an interview with Time magazine, which named him person of the year. </p><p>Today, the president-elect also rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange. More than a dozen people close to Trump told my colleagues that he sees the market as a barometer of his success and abhors the idea that his policies might hurt stock prices. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/trump-tv-stock-market.html" title="">That may prove more of a guardrail than institutional constraints</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli military vehicles near the Syrian border, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shir Torem/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-692fe885">Israel said it would stay in Syria for now</h2><p>Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said today that troops who seized a buffer zone in Syria after the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s government would remain until the establishment of a force that meets Israel’s security demands.
