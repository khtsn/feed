The Democrats said it would erode Americans’ faith in democracy and the rule of law. </p><p>“The pardon was a mistake,” Representative Jason Crow of Colorado said, adding, “I think it will make it harder for us going forward when we talk about upholding democracy.” Others defended Biden’s move as the justified action of a concerned father who feared that President-elect Donald Trump would follow through on his threats to seek retribution against his rivals.</p><p>As Trump continues to assemble his next administration, he has drawn criticism — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/trump-defiance-appointees.html" title="">and has doubled down on defiance</a>. Rather than turning to more credentialed choices after the collapse of Matt Gaetz’s bid for attorney general, Trump has named more ideological warriors, conspiracy theorists and even family members to senior government positions.</p><p>Over the weekend, Trump said he wanted to replace the F.B.I. director <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/trump-replace-christopher-wray.html" title="">with Kash Patel</a>, a critic of the bureau who has called for shutting down its headquarters. He also said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/massad-boulos-trump-middle-east.html?smid=url-share" title="">he would name Massad Boulos</a>, a Lebanese American businessman and the father-in-law of his daughter Tiffany, as a senior adviser covering Arab and Middle Eastern affairs, and Charles Kushner, the father of Ivanka Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/trump-charles-kushner-france-ambassador.html" title="">to be ambassador to France</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath of a Russian airstrike in northern Syria, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Al Rifai/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-54429fa5">Russian warplanes struck at rebels in Syria </h2><p>Russian and Syrian fighter jets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-assad.html" title="">struck targets across territory seized by rebels</a> in northwestern Syria today, according to Syrian state media.
