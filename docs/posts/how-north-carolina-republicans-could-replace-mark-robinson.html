    <h1>How North Carolina Republicans Could Replace Mark Robinson</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report from CNN</a> on Thursday that detailed disturbing comments that Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson supposedly made on a pornography website message board years ago has raised questions about whether he will remain the Republican nominee for governor in North Carolina.</p><p>Mr. Robinson’s campaign has insisted that the lieutenant governor will not drop out. Minutes before the CNN article was published, Mr. Robinson denied the report and said in a video posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/markrobinsonNC/status/1836841409388642512" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">X</a>: “We are staying in this race. We are in it to win it.”</p><p>The deadline for a candidate to withdraw is Thursday. To withdraw, a candidate must submit a written request to the North Carolina State Board of Elections before midnight on Thursday.</p><p>If Mr. Robinson were to drop out, the executive committee of the North Carolina Republican Party would select a replacement candidate. Then the state Board of Elections would determine “whether it is practical to reprint the ballots with the replacement nominee’s name,” according to state law.</p></div></div>
