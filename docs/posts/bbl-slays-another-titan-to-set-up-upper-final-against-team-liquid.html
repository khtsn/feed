</span> and Heretics, Team Liquid is the next team that stands in BBL&#39;s path, forcing them to run the gauntlet of the top three teams in the region. However, the results of today&#39;s matches have given BBL great odds to qualify to Champions. The only way they don&#39;t qualify is if they lose both the upper and lower finals while a team other than FNATIC or Heretics makes the grand final (excluding Team Liquid, who would already be in the grand final in this scenario).</p>

<p>For Heretics, a win today would have qualified them to Champions, but now a second loss could end their season. A win in the lower bracket still gets them to Champions, but a loss leaves a scenario where they fail to qualify. If, in addition to Heretics losing their next game, FNATIC place outside the top two and Liquid finish in third, they will miss out on Champions.</p>

<p>As for the match, BBL were fortunate enough to be able to pick Icebox for the first map. In their last meeting with Heretics, BBL nearly won the map 13-0, and today was hardly any different. Although Heretics tried a new composition, uniquely featuring a Yoru and Jett double duelist, BBL quickly won the map 13-6. Heretics kept up at the start of the map, winning the round two eco, and matching BBL up to 4-4. However, things quickly slipped out of their hand, as they lost out the rest of the half, as well as the second half pistol and bonus, at which point they were down 11-4. BBL closed out the map not much later.</p>

<p>The next map was Heretics&#39; pick of Ascent, a comfort map for them this year. BBL continued with their triple initiator comp that took down FNATIC yesterday, showcasing more fast set strategies that let them take an early lead on their attack side. Heretics was able to stabilize and bring the half to an even 6-6 score, finding success with retakes spearheaded by <span data-ref-id="6">

<p>Heretics started the second half again on the back foot, losing a 5v3 advantage on the pistol, giving BBL all four pistol wins on the day. <span data-ref-id="7">

</span> nearly stole the bonus round with some crazy Sheriff shots, but Heretics clutched the round out and took the next to tie the map at 8-8, with BBL on a low buy. However, Heretics ran low on time in their anti-eco, leading them to try to force into A, where <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9780/jamppi">
		Jamppi	</a>
</span> was ready and waiting to collect three kills.</p>


<p><em>Not enough time and not enough utility spells disaster for Heretics.</em></p>

<p>That one thrifty win swung the economy and the momentum in favor of BBL, who proceeded to rack up four in a row to get to match point. Heretics did well to get up to 11, on the brink of forcing overtime, but on the final round of regulation, they unsuspectingly walked into BBL&#39;s B main trap, who closed out the round, map, and series.</p>



<p>For the second match of the day, GIANTX took on Team Liquid. The former came into the match as massive underdogs, but was nearly able to take the upset win. In the end, however, it was Team Liquid that came away narrowly with a 2-1 victory, guaranteeing a top three finish. With this comes a minimum four additional Championship points, which secures Liquid a Champions berth in all but one specific scenario. For them to miss out on Champions, they have to lose out to finish in third, Heretics must finish in fourth, and either <span data-ref-id="9">

</span> or GIANTX must make a run to the grand final. For now, they advance to the upper final where they will face BBL.</p>

<p>Not much has changed in GIANTX&#39;s camp. With qualification from Championship points already out of the question, reaching the grand final is their only hope to make it to Champions, though falling to the lower bracket, the road there has only gotten tougher.</p>

</span>, where they got absolutely shredded on the first map. This time, it was on their map pick of Sunset where Team Liquid took an 11-1 lead in the first half. The duo of <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11494/keiko">
		Keiko	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/457/nats">
		nAts	</a>
</span> shut down GIANTX, and Liquid easily won the map 13-4.</p>

<p>Even more similarly to GIANTX&#39;s NAVI game, they showed that they weren&#39;t down and out after the first map. Coming into Liquid&#39;s pick of Corrode, they delivered a dominant half of their own. After the pistol and anti-eco round, GIANTX won nine straight rounds, bringing about a six round lead at the half. However, prior matches showed that their defense was the strong suit on the map, and heading into their much weaker attack side, the map wasn&#39;t done yet. Liquid immediately began the comeback and thanks to Keiko popping off again, was able to tie up the map at 11-11. However, GIANTX held strong at the finish line and closed out the last two rounds to tie the series 1-1.</p>

<p>On the final map of Ascent, worry started to grow in the Liquid camp, struggling to get things going as GIANTX took a 7-5 lead at the first half. Moving to the stronger side of defense, however, Liquid began building some momentum. They rode a pistol round win into six rounds to take the lead at 11-9, poised to hit match point.</p>


<p><em>Liquid&#39;s top performer continues to shine.</em></p>

<p>However, the next round, a tiles crunch went awry for Liquid, and <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6959/flickless">
		Flickless	</a>
</span> managed to clutch the round for GIANTX. With the momentum reset, the underdogs were the first to hit match point at 12-11. </p>


<p><em>A chaotic round, but Flickless comes out on top.</em></p>

<p>Backs against the wall, Liquid held strong and with a 3k from <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/14681/kamo">
		kamo	</a>
</span>, brought about overtime with a flawless round. They then quickly closed out overtime 14-12 to save themselves from the upset and advance to the upper final.</p>


<p><em>Liquid brings it into overtime.</em></p>

<p>Playoffs will continue tomorrow with the first round of elimination matches:</p>
