Is Surviving Trump 2.0</h2><h4>Mass layoffs, Congressional budget cuts and a series of threats from President Trump have put Washington’s future in question. We report from a job fair in the city, as District residents and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser maneuver for political and economic survival.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>We’re at a D.C. job fair for people affected by the DOGE layoffs. “Here’s a list of things we have open right now.” People are learning about unemployment benefits, food stamps and applying for open positions with local businesses and with the D.C. government. “We are contractors for U.S.A.I.D. So, we’re trying to explore our options now.” The gutting of the federal workforce has eliminated thousands of jobs for people living around the nation’s capital and strained the local economy. Many here are still in shock from being vilified and cast into a massive unemployment pool. “So, this is a senior cabinet-level position.” “I’ve not been to a job fair before. Honestly, there are a lot of really, highly qualified people who have been unfortunately laid off. I was most recently principal research scientist working with federal funding doing vaccine equity outreach. Our program did great work, and so to be told that you’re trash from the administration— you know, I’m advanced enough in my career that I think my ego can take the hit. But yesterday I had a hard time getting off the couch.” While the D.C. government says it’s open for business, its capacity to hire could be undercut by Congress if Republicans follow through on a plan to slash more than $1 billion from its budget. “I am worried about the whole D.M.V.—D.C., Maryland, Virginia. There’s going to be such a large workforce unemployed. How will the jobs even up to match that demand? I don’t see that happening. I haven’t received unemployment yet.” President Trump has more than once suggested taking over the district entirely, though doing so would require an act of Congress. “Good afternoon, everyone.” D.C.’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, butted heads with Trump in 2020 over his heavy-handed response to protesters following the death of George Floyd. “While we were peacefully protesting, Donald Trump was plotting. I created Black Lives Matter Plaza right behind me as a place where we could come together to say, ‘Enough.’” Five years later, the mayor is taking a different stance, focusing on shared priorities with the president. “We want to work with our partners in the federal government to ensure that D.C. always represents the strength and prosperity of this country.” She’s dismantled Black Lives Matter Plaza. And hours after Trump ordered the removal of a homeless encampment, near the State Department, she sent crews to clear the site. “I was very happy with what the mayor did. She was able to get them out quickly and at my direction and at the direction of the administration.” It remains to be seen just how far Trump and Congress will go in transforming the district. For now, with more federal layoffs looming, there appears no end in sight to the hemorrhaging of jobs here. “It just really— it’s a deep cut. And it is very personal.”</p></dd></dl></div></div>
