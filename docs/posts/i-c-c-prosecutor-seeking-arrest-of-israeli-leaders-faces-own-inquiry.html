data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The International Criminal Court will commission an independent investigation into accusations of sexual misconduct by its chief prosecutor, the court announced Monday.</p><p>The investigation into Karim Khan, the prosecutor best known for seeking arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas leaders for their conduct of the war in Gaza, will be carried out by an external body “in order to ensure a fully independent, impartial and fair process,” according to a <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-president-assembly-states-parties-investigation-alleged-misconduct-icc-elected" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by Paivi Kaukoranta, the chief of the international assembly that oversees the court.</p><p>In his own statement Monday, according to The Associated Press, Mr. Khan, whose office is responsible for investigating and prosecuting international war crimes and genocide, said he was aware of the investigation and had requested that his two deputy prosecutors take responsibility for the matter internally. “I welcome the opportunity to engage in this process,” he said. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13979123/British-lawyer-called-Netanyahu-arrested-war-crimes-denies-misconduct-following-harassment-claims.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a> reported in October that a female colleague had accused Mr. Khan of harassment, an allegation he denied. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/oct/27/icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-allegedly-tried-suppress-sexual-misconduct-claims" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guardian</a> later reported that Mr. Khan had tried to suppress the accuser’s claims, which he also denied.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After being made aware of the allegations, Ms. Kaukoranta, president of the assembly representing 125 nations that recognize the court’s authority, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/president-asp-statement-alleged-misconduct-icc-elected-official" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in late October that the court “seeks the consent of any alleged victim of misconduct before proceeding with an investigation,” but after a conversation with Mr. Khan’s accuser, the court “was not in a position to proceed.”</p><p>Days later, Mr. Khan said on <a href="https://x.com/KarimKhanQC/status/1850910371345035700" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> that the matter had been “closed” by the court’s oversight body without an investigation because no complaint had been made, and that the “alleged aggrieved person” had declined the option of an investigation. Mr. Khan also said he sought an investigation into how the information, which he called “disinformation,” had been made public.</p><p>The court, based in The Hague, did not say on Monday what had changed in recent weeks to prompt an investigation.</p><p>Mr. Khan set off global debate this spring when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/world/middleeast/icc-hamas-netanyahu.html" title="">sought arrest warrants</a> for Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, Yoav Gallant, then Israel’s defense minister, and three Hamas leaders on charges of crimes against humanity in the war that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>The Hamas leaders, Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Muhammad Deif, have all since been killed by Israeli forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When Mr. Khan requested the warrants, the U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, <a href="https://www.state.gov/warrant-applications-by-the-international-criminal-court/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the action. “We reject the Prosecutor’s equivalence of Israel with Hamas. It is shameful,” Mr. Blinken said in a statement, adding that the I.C.C. has no jurisdiction over Israel’s war with Hamas.</p><p>Israel, like the United States, has not adopted the statute that created the I.C.C. two decades ago, and does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction, so Mr. Netanyahu or Mr. Gallant do not face arrest in their own country. But the court’s ruling could make international travel difficult for the two men should the warrants be granted.</p><p>Though the chief prosecutor recommends arrest warrants, the court’s judges have the ultimate approval authority. A panel of three judges is currently deliberating on the arrest warrants sought by Mr. Khan.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eve Sampson is a reporter covering international news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eve-sampson">More about Eve Sampson</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/international-criminal-court">International Criminal Court</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/karim-khan">Karim Khan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoav-gallant">Yoav Gallant</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Israeli Attacks:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s military struck a house in northern Gaza where displaced families were sheltering, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/world/middleeast/gaza-jabaliya-israel.html">killing at least 34 people</a>.
