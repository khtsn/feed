But after a search around Oregon, I haven’t been able to find a single person who hunts the state’s wild truffles with a hog, as Mr. Cage did in the film.</p><p>Pigs will snarf as many truffles as they can, for one thing. They rip up the forest floor like cloven-hoofed bulldozers, which is why it’s been illegal to bring them on truffle hunts in Italy since the 1980s. And when a harvester is on the way to a secret truffle spot, they tend to give the game away.</p><p>“You put a 300-pound pig in the back of your Subaru and people know where you’re going,” said Deb Walker, a professional dog trainer, as she instructed about two dozen humans who had come to a farm outside Eugene this month to learn the art of working with canines to sniff out fussy, perishable, mysterious wild truffles. Around 2,000 dogs in the Pacific Northwest have graduated from similar courses over the past 20 years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/12oregon_truffles2-vmbc/13oregon_truffles2-vmbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/12oregon_truffles2-vmbc/13oregon_truffles2-vmbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/12oregon_truffles2-vmbc/13oregon_truffles2-vmbc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two curly-haired dogs stand on either side of a human surrounded by trees, ferns and dead branches." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/12oregon_truffles2-vmbc/13oregon_truffles2-vmbc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/12oregon_truffles2-vmbc/13oregon_truffles2-vmbc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/12oregon_truffles2-vmbc/13oregon_truffles2-vmbc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/12oregon_truffles2-vmbc/13oregon_truffles2-vmbc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="100vw" uri="nyt://image/2f26fbe3-c201-59b1-b8c3-a14b82cb84f8" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Charles Lefevre and his dogs, Dante, left, and Luca, hunting in a grove of Douglas fir outside Eugene, Ore. “Every time we’ve come in here, we find $5,000 worth of truffles,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saeed Rahbaran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>While many people are content simply to teach their dogs an exotic new trick, others have taken up truffle hunting as a serious hobby.

More accurately, Dr. Lefevre’s dogs, Dante and Luca, explored the grove, while he and I scrambled to keep up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Luca and Dante are Lagotto Romagnolos, a breed from Italy that is favored by truffle hunters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saeed Rahbaran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If I take my eyes off him for a second, he’ll eat a truffle,” he said as he followed Dante through a thicket of downed branches.</p><p>Black and white truffles, the region’s two most commonly dug varieties, have been found as far south as Point Reyes in California and as far north as Vancouver Island in British Columbia, but Oregon is especially rich in their favorite habitat. Dr. Lefevre described the ideal hunting ground as former grassland where Douglas firs were planted 15 to 30 years ago. He can spot classic truffle terrain from the wheel of his car, but finds satellite images more useful.</p><p>“The modern truffle hunter starts from Google Earth,” he said.</p><p>His hunch about this grove of firs had been paying off nicely since January, when he signed a lease to the truffling rights with the farmer who owns the land. “Every time we’ve come in here we find about $5,000 worth of truffles,” Dr. Lefevre said. He donates most of them to the truffle festival, which he helped found; he makes his living inoculating tree seedlings with European truffle spores and selling them to people who want to start their own orchards.</p><p>Dante and Luca are Lagotto Romagnolos, a breed that specializes in finding truffles. (Trainers say that any dog with motivation can hunt truffles.)</p><p>Some recent forays had taken a toll on Dante’s hips. He’d been somewhat restored by acupuncture the other day, and the smell of the woods seemed to revive him completely. The minute he would start to snuffle at a spot of fluffy, loamy topsoil, Dr. Lefevre dropped to one knee beside him, trying to snatch the prize and stash it in a pouch he wore on his hip before it could enter Dante’s stomach. This pattern — the dog digs; the human dives — was repeated about twice a minute.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Treated carefully, Oregon truffles may last for 10 days out of the ground.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saeed Rahbaran for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>You can eat a truffle like an apple.

Most humans, though, are far less interested in their nutrient content than in their flavor, most of which is concentrated in an aroma so piercing that it compels mice, squirrels and dogs to root in the dirt.</p><p>I buried my face in a handful of whites Dante and Luca had found. My first impression was of ramps or garlic chives, then button mushrooms, but the overwhelming scent was a potent animal reek. They were only distantly reminiscent of the better-known Italian white variety, the most valuable truffles in the world.</p><p>The whites were so pungent that at times even I could tell when I was standing over a ripe cluster.
