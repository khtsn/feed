    <h1>As Hurricane Milton Closes In, Some in Florida Make Last-Minute Evacuation Decisions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vincent Bradshaw, a retiree, did not plan to leave his Fort Myers home. But the more he thought about it, the more he didn’t want to take a chance. So he checked into a shelter at Dunbar High School on Wednesday morning.</p><p>“I came out fine in Hurricane Ian, but I saw what it did to Fort Myers Beach,” Mr. Bradshaw said. “It ate the beach up.”<span>  </span>This time, he said, “I didn’t want to chance it, because you can’t predict Mother Nature.”</p><p>Tevis McKinstry, of Fort Myers, said she had always opted against evacuating to shelters when hurricanes were headed her way. This time, she planned to stay with her daughter<span>  </span>in a second-floor condo two miles from her own home.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave,” she said. “All we can do is cross our fingers and pray.”</p><p>Some Floridians moved to safety at the urging of their loved ones.</p><p>Adam Seplowe, 58, who lives with his family two miles from the water in Tampa, checked into a hotel inland, about 30 miles north of downtown Tampa, on Wednesday afternoon, as winds picked up and major bridges in the area began to close.</p></div></div>
