Families carried sleeping bags, backpacks and pets in crates.</p><p>After considering the dire weather warnings, congested highways and gas shortages, Lennie Rodriguez, 61, left his home in Fort Myers for a nearby high school that had been converted to a shelter.</p><p>“It’s too late to do anything else,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “I just want to be on the safe side.”</p><p>For days, as Hurricane Milton intensified, state and local officials<span>  </span>warned people living in evacuation zones, and in manufactured and mobile homes, to leave for safer accommodations by Tuesday night. But decisions were still being made long after that. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Vincent Bradshaw, a retiree, did not plan to leave his Fort Myers home. But the more he thought about it, the more he didn’t want to take a chance. So he checked into a shelter at Dunbar High School on Wednesday morning.</p><p>“I came out fine in Hurricane Ian, but I saw what it did to Fort Myers Beach,” Mr. Bradshaw said. “It ate the beach up.”<span>  </span>This time, he said, “I didn’t want to chance it, because you can’t predict Mother Nature.”</p><p>Tevis McKinstry, of Fort Myers, said she had always opted against evacuating to shelters when hurricanes were headed her way. This time, she planned to stay with her daughter<span>  </span>in a second-floor condo two miles from her own home.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave,” she said. “All we can do is cross our fingers and pray.”</p><p>Some Floridians moved to safety at the urging of their loved ones.</p><p>Adam Seplowe, 58, who lives with his family two miles from the water in Tampa, checked into a hotel inland, about 30 miles north of downtown Tampa, on Wednesday afternoon, as winds picked up and major bridges in the area began to close.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I had family members calling me and telling me to leave,” Mr. Seplowe said. He ultimately decided to evacuate with his family out of concern over the projected storm surge.</p><p>Not all families ended up sticking together.</p><p>Outside a shelter at Middleton High School in Tampa, Mia Gomez, 8, sought refuge from the rain under the raised hatch of a car while her family’s paperwork was processed.</p><p>She said her father stayed behind to protect their home, but she was not concerned “because he doesn’t worry at all.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Audra D.
