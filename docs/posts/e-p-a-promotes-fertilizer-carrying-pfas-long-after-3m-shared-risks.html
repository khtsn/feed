The data suggested that the toxic chemicals, made by 3M, were fast becoming ubiquitous in the environment.

The presence of PFAS in the sewage meant those chemicals were being unwittingly spread on fields across the country.</p><p>3M didn’t publish the research, but the company did share its findings with the E.P.A. at a 2003 meeting, according to 3M documents reviewed by the The New York Times. The research and the E.P.A.’s knowledge of it has not been previously reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Today, the E.P.A. continues to promote sewage sludge as fertilizer and doesn’t require testing for PFAS, despite the fact that whistle-blowers, academics, state officials and the agency’s internal studies over the years have also raised contamination concerns.</p><p>“These are highly complex mixtures of chemicals,” said David Lewis, a former E.P.A. microbiologist who in the late 1990s issued early warnings of the risks in spreading sludge on farmland. The soil “becomes essentially permanently contaminated,” he said in a recent interview from his home in Georgia.</p><p>The concerns raised by Dr. Lewis and others went unheeded at the time.</p><p>The country is starting to wake up to the consequences.

The federal government regulates certain heavy metals and pathogens in sludge that is reused as fertilizer; it has no limits on PFAS.</p><p>“There’s absolutely enough evidence, with the high levels of contaminants that we see in the sludge, for the E.P.A. to regulate,” said Arjun K.

After decades of hiding the dangers of PFAS — a history outlined in lawsuits and <a href="https://annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334/aogh.4013" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peer-reviewed studies</a> based on previously secret industry documents — in 1998 it alerted the E.P.A. about the potential hazards.</p><p>The company had already found high levels of PFAS in the blood of its employees, and was starting to detect the chemicals in the wider population. It had also long tracked PFAS in wastewater from its factories.</p><p>Then in a 2000 study, 3M researchers noticed something alarming. While testing for PFAS in cities with “no known significant industrial use” of the chemicals, including Cleveland, Tenn., and Port St. Lucie, Fla., they found surprisingly high concentrations in sewage sludge.</p><p>A question weighed on the researchers’ minds: If there were no PFAS manufacturers present, where were the chemicals coming from?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Hints lay in 3M’s other research. The company had been studying how the chemicals could be released by PFAS-treated carpets during washing. And they were also studying how PFAS could leach from food packaging and other products.</p><p>In an interview, Kris Hansen, a former chemist at 3M who was involved in the research, said the presence in sludge “meant this contamination was probably occurring at any city” that was using 3M’s products.</p><p>The study showed, moreover, that PFAS was not getting broken down at wastewater treatment plants. “It was ending up in the sludge, and that was becoming biosolids, being mixed into soil,” Dr. Hansen said. “From there it can run into the groundwater, go back into people. It’s insidious.”</p><p>In September 2003, 3M officials met with the E.P.A. to discuss the company’s study of sludge contamination and other research, according to the internal records. At the end of the meeting, the E.P.A. requested “additional background information supporting this monitoring data,” the records show. </p><p>Sewage sludge has now been spread on millions of acres across the country. It’s difficult to know exactly how much, and E.P.A. data is incomplete. The fertilizer industry says <a href="https://www.biosolidsdata.org/data-downloads" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 2 million dry tons were used</a> on 4.6 million acres of farmland in 2018. And it estimates that farmers have obtained permits to use sewage sludge on nearly 70 million acres, or about a fifth of all U.S. agricultural land.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“If we really wanted to figure this problem out because we believe it’s in the interest of public health, we really needed to share that data widely,” said Dr. Hansen, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-pfos-inside-story" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has become a whistle-blower</a> against 3M. “But my memory is that the corporation was kind of caught up in the, ‘Oh my gosh, what do we do about this?’”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kris Hansen, a former 3M chemist who became a whistle-blower.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tim Gruber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-6836bdce">Early Warning, Unheeded</h2><p>Dr. Lewis was a rising star in the late 1990s as a microbiologist at the E.P.A.

Human beings had used waste to fertilize the land for millenniums, after all. But, as Dr. Lewis pointed out with his research, modern-day sewage most likely contained a slew of chemicals, including PFAS, that made it a very dangerous fertilizer.</p><p>He collected and examined sewage samples. He investigated illnesses and deaths he said could be linked to sludge. He started presenting his findings at scientific conferences.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“The chances that serious adverse effects will occur from a complex and unpredictable mixture of tens of thousands of chemical pollutants is a virtual certainty,” he said at the time. His research prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue guidelines protecting workers handling processed sewage sludge.</p><p>The E.P.A. eliminated his job in 2003.</p><p>He was a prominent voice on the issue at the time, but not the only one.</p><p>Rolf Halden, a professor at the School of Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University and an early researcher of contamination in biosolids, met with E.P.A. officials at least nine times since 2005 to warn about his own research, according to his records.</p><p>“The history of biosolids is that it was a toxic waste,” he said. For decades, he noted, sludge from New York City “was loaded on trains and shipped to the back corners of the country,” he said. Farmers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/25/nyregion/ultimate-alchemy-sludge-gold-big-new-york-export-may-make-desert-budget-bloom.html" title="">often took the sludge without knowledge</a> of its possible contamination.</p><p>In 2006, an E.P.A. contractor offered him samples of municipal sewage sludge left over from earlier agency testing.

Action has been slow, she said, even though E.P.A.’s surveys of sludge had shown “all kinds of pollutants — flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, steroids, hormones,” she said. “It’s the most horrible story,” she said.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.epaoig.gov/reports/audit/epa-unable-assess-impact-hundreds-unregulated-pollutants-land-applied-biosolids-human" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2018 report</a> by the E.P.A.’s inspector accused the agency of failing to properly regulate biosolids, saying it had “reduced staff and resources in the biosolids program over time, creating barriers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>The Biden administration has said it would publish a risk assessment of PFAS in biosolids by the end of 2024. That would be a first step toward setting limits on PFAS in sewage sludge used as fertilizer.</p><p>There is another solution, experts say. Under the Clean Water Act, wastewater treatment plants have a legal authority to limit PFAS pollution from local factories. It’s known as the Clean Water Act “pretreatment program,” preventing chemicals from reaching sewage in the first place.</p><p>In the past two years, two cities — <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/pfas-progress/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Burlington,</a> N.C., and <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/land-mark-settlement-filed-to-clean-up-forever-chemical-pollution/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Calhoun,</a> Ga. — have ordered industries to clean up the effluent they send to wastewater treatment plants. In one instance, a textile producer decided to stop using PFAS entirely.</p><p>Those actions came after a local environmental group sued the cities. “Industry is in the best position to control their own pollution, rather than treating wastewater treatment plants like industrial, toxic dumping grounds,” said Kelly Moser, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which filed the lawsuits.</p><p>The National Association of Clean Water Agencies, which represents wastewater treatment plants, said more than 1,600 utilities already had pretreatment programs in place, though not necessarily for PFAS. (The group also said research showed that the chemicals were coming from household waste, including human waste, not just factories.)</p><p>Adam Krantz, the group’s chief executive, said many utilities were waiting for the E.P.A. to set standards. That would strengthen treatment plants’ ability to hold the ultimate polluters responsible, he said. “If these chemical companies were aware of PFAS’ potential dangers and kept it quiet,” he said, “then these polluters have to pay.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hiroko Tabuchi covers pollution and the environment for The Times.
