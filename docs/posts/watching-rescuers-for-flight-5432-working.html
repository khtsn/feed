    <h1>Watching Rescuers for Flight 5432 Working</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the quiet halls of Reagan Airport and from parked cars along the George Washington Parkway, people paused and watched the scene on the Potomac River as rescuers rushed to a small passenger plane that crashed into the water Wednesday night.</p><p>The plane, a Bombardier CRJ700 with about 65 seats, was operating as Flight 5342 for American Airlines when it collided with a military helicopter at around 9 p.m. and crash-landed into the river, according to officials.</p><p>Along the George Washington Parkway, which runs next to the Potomac, dozens of people parked their cars to get a glimpse of rescue boats in the dark, frigid waters.</p><p>Thumping helicopters crisscrossed the night sky. Several ambulances were gathered at a police dock in southwest Washington, as flashing lights lit up a bank of the river.</p></div></div>
