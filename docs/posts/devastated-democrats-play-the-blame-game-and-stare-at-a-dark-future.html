    <h1>Devastated Democrats Play the Blame Game, and Stare at a Dark Future</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A depressed and demoralized Democratic Party is beginning the painful slog into a largely powerless future, as its leaders grapple with how deeply they underestimated Donald J. Trump’s resurgent hold on the nation.</p><p>The nationwide repudiation of the party stunned many Democrats who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-election.html" title="">had expressed a “nauseous” confidence</a> about their chances in the final weeks of the race. As they sifted through the wreckage of their defeats, they found no easy answers as to why voters so decisively rejected their candidates.</p><p>In more than two dozen interviews, lawmakers, strategists and officials offered a litany of explanations for Vice President Kamala Harris’s failure — and just about all of them fit neatly into their preconceived notions of how to win in politics.</p><p>The quiet criticism, on phone calls, in group chats and during morose team meetings, was a behind-the-scenes preview of the intraparty battle to come, with Democrats quickly falling into the ideological rifts that have defined their party for much of the Trump era.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>What was indisputable was how badly Democrats did. They lost the White House, surrendered control of the Senate and appeared headed to defeat in the House. They performed worse than four years ago in cities and suburbs, rural towns and college towns. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html" title="">early New York Times analysis</a> of the results found the vast majority of the nation’s more than 3,100 counties swinging rightward since President Biden won in 2020.</p><p>The results showed that the Harris campaign, and Democrats more broadly, had failed to find an effective message against Mr. Trump and his down-ballot allies or to address voters’ unhappiness about the direction of the nation under Mr. Biden. The issues the party chose to emphasize — abortion rights and the protection of democracy — did not resonate as much as the economy and immigration, which Americans often highlighted as among their most pressing concerns.</p><p>Many Democrats were considering how to navigate a dark future, with the party unable to stop Mr. Trump from carrying out a right-wing transformation of American government. Others turned inward, searching for why the nation rejected them.</p><p>They spoke about misinformation and the struggle to communicate the party’s vision in a diminished news environment inundated with right-wing propaganda. They conceded that Ms. Harris had paid a price for not breaking from Mr. Biden’s support of Israel in the war in Gaza, which angered Arab American voters in Michigan. Some felt their party had moved too far to the left on social issues like transgender rights. Others argued that as Democrats had shifted rightward on economic issues, they had left behind the interests of the working class.</p><p>They lamented a Democratic Party brand that has become toxic in many parts of the country. Several noted that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-nebraska.html" title="">independent Senate candidate in Nebraska</a> ran 14 percentage points ahead of Ms. Harris in the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And many said they were struggling to process the scale of their loss, describing their feelings as a mix of shock, mourning and panic over what might come in a second Trump administration.</p><p>“I am pretty devastated and worried,” said Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas, who served as a co-chair for the Harris campaign. “There’s real, imminent danger for people here. There is real danger here ahead for Americans — including many Americans who voted for Trump.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="One woman crying on another woman’s shoulder at Kamala Harris’s concession speech." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc/07pol-democrats-reax-sub-bhpc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a5cae7be-f67f-5ecf-ba7a-85bda3ebca5c" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters at Ms. Harris’s concession speech.

This trend of workers leaving the Democratic Party started with whites, and it has accelerated to Latinos and Blacks.”</p><p>Mr. Sanders, a political independent who has long criticized the influence of the party’s biggest donors and veteran operatives, offered a pessimistic forecast: “Whether or not the Democratic Party has the capability, given who funds it and its dependency on well-paid consultants, whether it has the capability of transforming itself, remains to be seen.”</p><p>Mr. Sanders was hardly the only one who diagnosed the party’s problem as being too beholden to the needs of its identity groups. Mr. Trump spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/trump-republican-transgender-ads.html" title="">tens of millions of dollars on anti-transgender television advertising</a>, which went unanswered by the Harris campaign and its allies.</p><p>Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who was one of two dozen Democrats who sought the party’s presidential nomination in 2020, suggested the party should shift its approach to transgender issues.</p><p>“Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,” Mr. Moulton said. “I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Democrats should not give in to prejudice and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/04/trumps-closing-ad-features-debunked-claim-about-olympic-boxer/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">misinformation</a>. She compared the fight for transgender rights to the struggle over gay marriage, in which public opinion shifted quickly.</p><p>“We need to create space for people’s fears and let them get to know people,” said Ms. Jayapal, who described herself as “the proud mom of a daughter who happens to be trans.”</p><p>“And we need to counter the idea that my daughter is a threat to anyone else’s children,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris faced anger from voters over the Biden administration’s support of Israel in the war in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden hugging his daughter, Ashley, onstage at the Democratic National Convention.

She was trying to get elected in the shadow of a president who was unpopular and who the public had overwhelmingly been saying should not run for re-election and took too long to step aside.”</p><p>Even David Plouffe, a veteran Democratic strategist whom Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-david-plouffe-obama.html" title="">brought into her operation</a> after Mr. Biden dropped out, seemed to suggest that the president had put her in a difficult position.</p><p>“We dug out of a deep hole but not<span>  </span>enough,” Mr. Plouffe wrote on X.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s defenders said it was not his fault.</p><p>Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden ally, said he did not think the president had been a drag on Ms. Harris. She ran “a terrific campaign,” he added.</p><p>“There’s a couple of groups in the United States, young men and Latino voters, that just did not respond in a positive way to our candidate and our message and our record,” he said. “We had a gap that we didn’t close.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For her part, Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/harris-concession-speech.html" title="">delivered a concession speech</a> that urged supporters to remain vigilant about the present and optimistic about the future, and to keep fighting for their values. She did not point fingers or cast blame.</p><p>“I am so proud of the race we ran, and the way we ran it,” she said. “Hear me when I say, the light of America’s promise will always burn bright. As long as we never give up. And as long as we keep fighting.”</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Biden addressed the nation from the Rose Garden, urging his supporters to remain optimistic and tenacious.</p><p>“Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,” he said. “We all get knocked down, but the measure of our character, as my dad would say, is how quickly we get back up.”</p><p>As they reflected on the fallout, Democratic officials compared notes about where this Election Day ranked on their list of horrible experiences.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Matt Bennett, the executive vice president for public affairs at Third Way, a centrist think tank, said the party had not faced a crisis as severe since the 1980s, when Democrats lost three straight presidential races in landslides.</p><p>To regain their grip on power, Democrats must embrace a more moderate approach, he argued. But that will not be easy, Mr. Bennett warned, since the party is facing a leadership vacuum with Mr. Biden weakened and Ms. Harris defeated.</p><p>“The one way to beat a right-wing populist is through the center,” Mr. Bennett said. “You must become the party that is more pragmatic, reasonable and more sane. That’s where we have to go.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voting at Oakman Elementary School in Dearborn, Mich., which has a large Arab American and Muslim population and voted for former President Donald J.
