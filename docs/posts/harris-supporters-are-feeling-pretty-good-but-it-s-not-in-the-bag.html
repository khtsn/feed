With Donald Trump’s constant bait-taking during the debate and the endorsement by Taylor Swift, with less than two months until Election Day, on the surface, things have started to look like they’re falling into place for a Harris win. On Friday, I was a guest on “Real Time With Bill Maher,” and Mr. Maher, who has never been one to underestimate Mr. Trump’s appeal, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-maher-trump-election-prediction_n_66e20bf2e4b000d8c5350133" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declared</a> that he thinks it’s finally over politically for the former president.</p><p>On the show, I disagreed. I still don’t think any of us should feel confident that we know how this will go. Does Ms. Harris have fund-raising momentum? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/harris-debate-donations.html" title="">Yes</a>. Did she win last week’s debate? According to post-debate polls, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/election-poll-trump-harris-debate/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">yes</a>. Did Ms. Swift direct a lot of potential voters to research how to register, presumably to vote for Ms. Harris? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/taylor-swift-voter-registration.html" title="">Yes</a>. Did J. Ann Selzer, the oracle of Iowa, just release a poll showing Mr. Trump ahead by only four points in the Hawkeye State? <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/09/15/iowa-poll-donald-trump-iowa-lead-shrinks-as-kamala-harris-replaces-joe-biden/75180245007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yes</a>. So why am I holding off on joining the “it’s over” chorus?</p><p>First, there’s not a lot of evidence that the debate helped Ms. Harris’s numbers in a meaningful way — at least not yet. ABC News/Ipsos <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-debate-winner-maintaining-slight-lead-trump-poll/story?id=113673862" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polling</a> showed her with a six-point lead among likely voters before the debate and showed the same result after. Her margin in several averages of national polls hovers around two points, a margin that makes the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split <a href="https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1835674434033590289" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reasonably likely</a>. (The analyst Nate Silver says the odds of such an outcome are around <a href="https://x.com/NateSilver538/status/1835638691441577999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one in four</a>.)</p><p>And if you look at the polling averages from a <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">variety</a> of <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">different</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sources</a>, in the seven battleground states that receive the greatest attention, the race is extremely close. Mr. Trump tends to hold a negligible lead in some of the Sun Belt tossup states, as Ms. Harris does in Wisconsin and Michigan. Neither candidate leads by more than two points in any of those states. Pennsylvania, the biggest prize of them all, consistently shows a difference in the <em>tenths</em> of a percentage point.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The reality is that the debate may have done more to fire up or reassure Ms. Harris’s existing supporters than to add new voters to her ranks in large numbers. While the ABC/Ipsos poll found that Ms. Harris’s supporters back her more strongly than Mr. Trump’s supporters back him, it also still found that nearly half (47 percent) of respondents think Ms. Harris is too liberal. It’s of course better to have your side more energized than your opponent’s, but an enthusiastic vote doesn’t count more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/opinion/harris-trump-debate-polls.html" title="">a begrudging one</a> so long as they both turn out.</p><p>Maybe the vibes are a leading indicator and the polls will catch up in the coming days. Or maybe the polls are simply missing something happening on the ground that is not being captured in the data. Either way, while Ms. Harris may be slightly favored at this point, the emphasis remains heavy on the “slightly.”</p><p>Popular vote-wise, the race favors Ms. Harris. But in the states that are going to be decisive in the Electoral College, it remains either’s race to win.</p><h2 id="link-31cb0204">Odds and Ends</h2><p><strong>Swift results.</strong> While there is data suggesting an uptick in voter registrations immediately following Ms. Swift’s endorsement, there is mixed evidence among voters as to whether it actually changed many minds. In the ABC/Ipsos poll <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-debate-winner-maintaining-slight-lead-trump-poll/story?id=113673862" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only 6 percent</a> said Ms. Swift’s endorsement made them more likely to vote for Ms. Harris. (Then again, in a state where the difference is in the tenths-of-a-point range, even small things can be big things.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><strong>Go left, young woman. </strong>The gender gap among 18- to 29-year-olds is real and growing.
