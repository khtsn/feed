In 1994, Noel briefly quit the band after Liam <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/oasis-reunion-feud-why-did-they-break-up-noel-liam-gallagher-fight-b1178534.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threw a tambourine</a> at his head, Noel said later.

Liam believed the image was beneficial, while Noel thought the band should stick to music. Things devolve into a shouting match.</p><p>On tape, the brothers do agree about taking cocaine. “We all snort white lines every day,” Noel says.

The suit was later dropped.</p><p>The Gallaghers formed new bands: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, and Beady Eye, fronted by Liam.</p><p>That didn’t stop the bickering.
