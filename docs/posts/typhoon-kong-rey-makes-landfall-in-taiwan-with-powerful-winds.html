The storm approached the island with maximum sustained winds of <a href="https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp2324web.txt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 126 miles per hour,</a> equivalent to those of a strong Category 3 hurricane, according to the U.S. Navy’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center.</p><p>More than 8,600 people had been evacuated in nine cities and counties on the island as of Thursday morning, according to Taiwan’s Interior Ministry.</p><p>The entire island was <a href="https://www.cwa.gov.tw/V8/E/P/Typhoon/TY_WARN.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under land and sea warnings</a> on Thursday afternoon, meaning that sustained winds of at least 39 m.p.h. were predicted to hit or come close to Taiwan within hours.

More than 4,000 emergency workers had been deployed to prepare for rescue efforts across several southern provinces, according to the state-run <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/20241030/d60ffdbd875b41fbb634c9f8c6652d2d/c.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Xinhua News Agency</a>.</p><p>Kong-rey hit Taiwan after skirting the northern Philippines, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/world/asia/tropical-storm-trami-vietnam-phillipines.html" title="">battered by Tropical Storm Trami</a> last week.

Some ferry services were suspended in southeastern Taiwan, and fishing boats were called to shore. The government also banned hikers from entering mountainous areas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In the eastern coastal city of Hualien, which was hit by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/world/asia/hualien-earthquake-damage-taiwan.html" title="">magnitude 7.4 earthquake in April</a>, the authorities prepared supplies and vehicles to help evacuate people.</p><p>In Yilan, a northeastern county, strong winds and rain had arrived by early Wednesday. At Suao Port in Yilan, which is usually crowded with military and civilian ships, a few vessels were docked at the harbor.</p><p>On social media, Taiwanese people expressed concern that such a powerful storm was arriving so late in the year.
