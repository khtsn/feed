Kennedy Jr. from appearing on the state’s November ballot</a>, finding that the independent presidential candidate’s assertion that he had rented a bedroom in a friend’s home did not make him a New York resident as he had claimed.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Kennedy’s opponents began trying to have him barred a second time for good measure.</p><p>In Mineola State Supreme Court, lawyers for two voters suing Mr. Kennedy’s campaign said that the campaign had employed a firm whose subcontractors used deceptive tactics to gather signatures to qualify him for the ballot. The plaintiffs, backed by the Democratic National Committee, want Justice Robert G. Bogle to order the State Board of Elections to keep Mr. Kennedy’s name off the ballot.</p><p>The trial, which is expected to last about a week, is likely to offer insight into the campaign’s expensive effort to secure ballot access in all 50 states. It could highlight the perils of hiring paid signature gatherers. And it could give Mr. Kennedy’s opponents a chance to erode his support in an election that could be swayed by mere thousands of votes.</p><p>On Monday, the plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that the nominating petition submitted by Mr. Kennedy’s campaign, which included about 150,000 signatures, had been riddled with errors and fraud.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The plaintiffs claim that canvassers misled New Yorkers into signing the petition to put Mr. Kennedy on the ballot. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/us/politics/rfk-signatures-ny.html" title="">reported</a> in May that paid signature gatherers had been folding over the tops of petitions to conceal the names of Mr. Kennedy and his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, and that some had claimed they were gathering signatures for Democrats and generic third-party candidates.</p><p>In opening statements Monday, Thomas J. Garry, a lawyer for Elaine Portuondo Smith and Andrena Y. Wyatt, the plaintiffs, said that the candidate had been aware of the deception. After Mr. Kennedy learned about it, Mr. Garry said, he promised that the campaign would discard the signatures, but it did not.</p><p>“Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was fully informed and intimately involved,” Mr. Garry said.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s lawyers agreed to forgo opening statements: Inclement weather canceled the lead attorney’s flight from Buffalo. Mr. Kennedy’s campaign manager, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, said earlier this year that the conduct of the subcontractors had been “utterly at odds with all of our intensive training and material.”</p><p>Several witnesses who testified Monday had been quoted in t<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/us/politics/rfk-signatures-ny.html" title="">he New York Times article</a>.</p><p>Joel Berg recounted how he had gone for a morning jog in Brooklyn this spring and as he arrived at Grand Army Plaza, a man with a clipboard had asked for his signature to help get President Biden and other candidates on the ballot in the Democratic primary.</p><p>This request struck Mr. Berg as odd, because the primary had already happened. Mr. Berg, who has himself collected signatures, said that he noticed that the name at the top of the petition was covered. The gatherer, he said, mumbled that the petition was really to help get Mr. Kennedy on New York’s ballot.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“He was engaged in fraud,” Mr. Berg said of the signature collector.</p><p>As testimony proceeded Monday, law enforcement officers moved around the chamber inspecting entrances and exits. Mr. Kennedy is expected to testify later this week.</p><p>It is the second case that could block the political scion from the New York ballot. A judge in Albany <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/nyregion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-new-york-residency.html" title="">ruled</a> last week that Mr. Kennedy’s petition was invalid because it used a “sham” address to assert his New York residency.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has appealed, but the D.N.C. has said it is looking into whether the finding could be grounds for challenging him in other states. As of Monday, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/presidential-candidates-third-party-independent.html" title="">on the ballot in 19</a>, including the battlegrounds of Michigan and North Carolina.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s campaign has been defined by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/us/politics/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html" title="">fringe views on vaccines</a> and other topics, and the perception that he could pull votes from Democrats. (Recent polling suggests that his support has sagged and that he now pulls more voters from former President Donald J. Trump.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Last week, The Times and other outlets reported that Mr. Kennedy had unsuccessfully sought a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign to offer an endorsement in exchange for a cabinet position. Last month, he had similar discussions with the Trump campaign.</p><p>He has also struggled to raise money and had a string of bad press: He was recently forced to respond to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/kennedy-sexual-assault-accusation.html" title="">sexual assault allegations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-bear-central-park.html" title="">the revelation that he left a dead bear cub</a> in Central Park in 2014.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rebecca Davis O’Brien covers campaign finance and money in U.S. elections.
