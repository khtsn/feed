For far too long, federal taxpayers have been forced to fund biased news.” “There’s nothing more American than PBS. As a membership organization, our local service is at the heart of our work. We’ve been proudly fulfilling our mission for nearly 60 years, using the public airwaves and other technologies to help educate, engage and inspire the American people.” “I welcome the opportunity to discuss the essential role of public media in delivering unbiased, nonpartisan, fact-based reporting to Americans. Nearly 100 percent of Americans live within range of a public radio station. We cover what matters to local communities: crop prices, cookoffs and local sports teams, alongside news of the nation and the world.” “The American people want to know is Elmo now, or has he ever been a member of the Communist Party of the United States? A yes or no.” “No.” “Now, are you sure, Ms. Kerger? Because he’s obviously red. Now, I’m obviously using some humor here, but the fact that we’re sitting here today talking about defunding public television is actually not funny. At a time where we can’t agree on basic facts, and while the free press is under attack, we need public media like PBS and NPR more than ever.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/26/multimedia/26biz-pbs-npr-top-cbhq/26biz-pbs-npr-top-cbhq-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Republicans accused the nation’s two largest public media networks of institutional bias.

In 1969, Fred Rogers, the star of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/media/pbs-npr-congress-funding.html" title="">testified before Congress</a> to protest cuts proposed by the Nixon administration.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Wednesday, the chief executives of NPR and PBS defended their programming and their value to listeners and viewers. They emphasized the community journalism that covers local sports teams and crop prices — often in rural areas with few other broadcasters — and beloved children’s shows like “Clifford the Big Red Dog” and “Curious George.”</p><p>“There’s nothing more American than PBS,” said Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS.</p><p>Ms. Greene took an adversarial stance from the start. She grilled Katherine Maher, the chief executive of NPR, about social media posts that she had written before she became the leader of the public radio network, in which she described Mr. Trump as a “racist” and “sociopath.” Ms. Maher said that she regretted those posts and would not have written them today. “They represented a time when I was reflecting on something that the president had said rather than who he is,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Greene also repeated assertions that journalists from both broadcasters underplayed a story, during the 2020 campaign, about the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop. Ms. Maher, who was not running NPR at the time, said that “our current editorial leadership thinks that was a mistake, as do I.”</p><p>Republicans also cited the experience of Uri Berliner, a veteran NPR business editor who argued in an essay last year that his organization had become infused with liberal bias. The essay, published by The Free Press, became a rallying cry for conservatives eager to strip the broadcaster of federal funds; Mr. Berliner later resigned.</p><p>Asked on Wednesday how he felt about the day’s hearing, Mr. Berliner replied: “I don’t believe NPR should be defunded. But I think it should turn down federal support and openly acknowledge and embrace its progressive orientation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The hearing swung wildly between Democrats expressing ardent support for children’s programming and dark pronouncements by Republicans about the “propaganda” and “communist agenda” ostensibly espoused by public media, which Ms. Greene accused of “grooming children.” But there were moments of levity.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a  Republican from Georgia, organized the hearing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Representative Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat, held up a sign that read, “Fire Elon, Save Elmo,” referring to Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman who is leading Mr. Trump’s effort to shrink the size of the federal government.</p><p>At another point, Representative Robert Garcia, a Democrat from California, sarcastically asked Ms. Kerger if Elmo was a member of the Communist Party. (“Well, he is a puppet,” she replied. “But no.”) Mr. Garcia also asked if Bert and Ernie, two characters on “Sesame Street” who live together, were part of an “extreme homosexual agenda” and if Cookie Monster, the “Sesame Street” character, was “silencing pro-cookie voters.”</p><p>“Cookies are a sometimes food,” Ms. Kerger responded.</p><p>Representative James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, recalled relying in his youth on local public radio for news while working as a farmer in a rural district of his state. But today, he said, “I don’t even recognize NPR anymore.” He asked why public media deserved the same level of government funding given the plethora of digital news outlets now available to Americans regardless of where they live.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The government-backed Corporation for Public Broadcasting received $535 million in public funds for this year; most of that money is spent on public radio and TV stations across the country, with a small portion of it going directly to NPR and PBS. Ms. Maher said that NPR produced “unbiased, nonpartisan, fact-based reporting” and that it had 43 million weekly users around the country. Ms. Kerger described PBS and its programming and local news coverage as part of the community fabric.</p><p>The Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/26/americans-more-likely-to-support-than-oppose-continuing-federal-funding-for-npr-and-pbs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Monday</a> that a survey this month showed that 43 percent of adults believed NPR and PBS should continue to receive federal funding; 24 percent said Congress should remove those funds; and 33 percent said they were not sure.</p><p>Toward the end of the hearing, Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, cited Mr. Rogers’s testimony before Congress, arguing that quality educational programming was a cause that should transcend political differences.</p><p>“Mr. Rogers understood what we’ve forgotten in this country,” Mr. Khanna said. “Some things are more valuable than money at a time where a country is polarized. I wish we had a little more empathy and caring, and that’s not a partisan issue.”</p><p>Robert Draper<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
