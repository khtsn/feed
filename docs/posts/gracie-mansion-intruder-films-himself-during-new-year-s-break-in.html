One minute later, a police officer noticed Mr. Aromando walking around inside the mansion.</p><p>Mr. Aromando was unarmed when he was arrested. He was carrying several items, including a Christmas ornament he had taken from the mansion, the police said. In an interview with a police officer, Mr. Aromando shared a video recorded on his phone, which showed him taking the ornament from a drawer inside the residence.</p><p>Police officers assigned to guard the mansion did not notice him scaling the fence, the police spokesman said. The closed-circuit television video of the break-in was found only after he was arrested.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Aromando lives on the Upper East Side, about seven blocks from Gracie Mansion, the police said. The police did not know on Thursday why he had broken into the building.</p><p>He was arraigned on Thursday. His bail was set at $5,000 cash. A judge imposed a curfew of 11 p.m., and ordered Mr. Aromando to stay away from Gracie Mansion.</p><p>Mr. Adams celebrated New Year’s Eve in Times Square, but a spokeswoman for his office declined to say where he went after the events in Midtown ended. There have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/nyregion/eric-adams-maya-wiley-endorsement-jumaane.html" title="">long been questions</a> over where Mr. Adams lives. He owns an apartment in Brooklyn and co-owns a co-op in New Jersey with his longtime partner, and he was known to sleep at Brooklyn Borough Hall when he was borough president during the pandemic.</p><p>Mr. Adams says that he lives in Gracie Mansion and uses it prolifically as a venue for cultural events, and he is known to stay out late partaking in the city’s nightlife.</p><p>The mayor said in a television interview in 2023 that he liked living along the East River and enjoyed sitting on the mansion’s porch having a cigar and a glass of cognac. But he has also lamented that the building, which was built in the 1790s, has ghosts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“People think I’m joking, but there’s a ghost that runs around here,” he said.</p><p>Emma G.
