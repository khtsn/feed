    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few hours after midnight on New Year’s Day, a man scaled the fence surrounding Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, and broke into the building before being arrested, a Police Department spokesman said.</p><p>Mayor Adams was not at home at the time, a spokeswoman for the mayor said.</p><p>The bizarre incident was recorded by surveillance cameras, which captured the man, Michael Aromando, 20, climbing the fence at 4:23 a.m. Wednesday, according to a written account of the incident from the Manhattan district attorney’s office. One minute later, a police officer noticed Mr. Aromando walking around inside the mansion.</p><p>Mr. Aromando was unarmed when he was arrested. He was carrying several items, including a Christmas ornament he had taken from the mansion, the police said. In an interview with a police officer, Mr. Aromando shared a video recorded on his phone, which showed him taking the ornament from a drawer inside the residence.</p><p>Police officers assigned to guard the mansion did not notice him scaling the fence, the police spokesman said. The closed-circuit television video of the break-in was found only after he was arrested.</p></div></div>
