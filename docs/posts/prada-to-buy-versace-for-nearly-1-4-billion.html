And it marks the end of Capri’s attempt to create an American luxury group to rival LVMH and Kering, while signaling an attempt by Prada to create an Italian competitor to the powerhouses.</p><p>“It’s a bold and ambitious move by Prada,” said Robert Burke, the eponymous founder of Robert Burke Associates. “The acquisition would position Prada to diversify its portfolio and compete on a larger global stage.”</p><p>Versace will join Prada and Miu Miu, as well as Luna Rossa, the America’s Cup sailing team, and the pastry brand Marchesi as part of the Prada Group, creating a “best in class” mosaic of Italian savoir-faire. (The group also includes the footwear brands Car Shoe and Church’s.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It also gives the Prada Group’s fashion holding critical mass, adding a ready-to-wear brand with a notably different identity to those of Miu Miu and Prada — as well as one that is not dependent on the designer Miuccia Prada — to the mix.</p><p>In a news release, Andrea Guerra, Prada Group’s chief executive, said the acquisition would add, “a new dimension, different and complementary,” to the Group. “Versace has huge potential,” he added, while noting, “the journey will be long.”</p><p>Prada plans to fund the acquisition with debt, borrowing more than one billion euros. The plan was approved by both companies’ boards and they expect the deal to close in the second half of the year, pending approval by regulators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A classic Versace body-con look from the Fall 2025 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Versace</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>And a Fall 2025 Versace look, featuring a corset and puffer ball gown skirt.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Versace</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Prada Group has been the rare success story during a general downturn in the luxury market, reporting <a href="https://www.pradagroup.com/en/news-media/news-section/25-03-04-prada-group-24-fy-results.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024 revenues</a> of €5.4 billion, a 17 percent increase, driven in part by the tremendous recent success of Miu Miu, which experienced retail sales growth of 93 percent last year.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>By contrast, in its most recent <a href="https://www.capriholdings.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2025/Capri-Holdings-Limited-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results/default.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial report</a> Capri, which also owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, said it expected Versace revenues to drop to $810 million in its current fiscal year, from $1 billion in 2024. Versace has been seen as a potential acquisition target since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/business/tapestry-capri-merger-luxury-fashion.html" title="">an attempt</a> by Tapestry, the group that includes Coach and Kate Spade, to acquire Capri was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/business/tapestry-capri-merger-coach-versace.html" title="">blocked</a> last year by the Federal Trade Commission. (Speculation that Prada would also buy Jimmy Choo, given its expertise in leather goods, was not borne out.) </p><p>“The Versace business is in need of a complete turnaround,” said Luca Solca, a senior analyst with the research firm Bernstein. At the same time, he added, Prada’s track record with acquisitions “leaves much to be desired.”</p><p>Indeed, the Versace takeover is not Prada’s first try to extend its winning formula to other brands. In 1999, after a decade in which it helped define Italian fashion, Prada went on a buying spree, acquiring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/31/business/prada-will-buy-control-of-jil-sander.html" title="">Jil Sander</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/10/business/international-business-51-lang-stake-is-sold-to-prada.html" title="">Helmut Lang</a>, two brands that seemed to share an intellectual approach to dressing with the group’s core brand. It turned out, however, that the alchemy Miuccia Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli created at Prada was not transferable. The group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/04/business/worldbusiness/prada-begins-talks-to-sell-unprofitable-helmut-lang.html" title="">sold Lang</a> in 2005 and it divested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/business/worldbusiness/jil-sander-splits-again-from-prada.html" title="">Sander</a> the following year.</p><p>Versace will give them the opportunity to rewrite that narrative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A deliberately frumpy look from the Prada Fall 2025 collection.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">MONIC</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>And another, deliberately conceived to challenge classic stereotypes of femininity and prettiness.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">MONIC</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Prada and Versace are, on the surface, a study in contrasts. Versace made its name on a celebration of flash and fantasy, reveling in sun, sex, the male gaze and the tightrope between bad taste and elegance. Prada, by contrast, embraced a contrarian exploration of the meaning of femininity, gender politics and the strange allure of ugly chic. </p><p>But, Mr. Bertelli said in the news release, “we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship and heritage,” as well as an understanding of the consumer power of brand semiology — the upside triangle, the medusa head — and a belief in the importance of family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mrs. Prada is close to Donatella Versace, who stepped in to run the company her brother Gianni founded in 1997 after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/us/versace-fashion-innovator-slain-in-miami-beach.html" title="">his assassination</a>; though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/style/donatella-versace-dario-vitale.html" title="">Ms. Versace left her position</a> as chief creative officer last month after almost 30 years, she remains chief brand ambassador, and has always felt an enormous sense of responsibility to ensure the future of her brother’s legacy. She is reportedly “delighted’ to have her brand back in family hands.</p><p>Though the Prada Group is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Mr. Bertelli remains chairman. Lorenzo Bertelli, one of Mr. Bertelli and Mrs. Prada’s two sons, is chief marketing officer and considered the heir apparent to the company, which was founded in 1913 by Mrs. Prada’s grandfather. Even the designer who took Ms. Versace’s place at Versace, Dario Vitale, had spent the previous 14 years at Miu Miu working with Mrs. Prada (who is creative director of Miu Miu and co-creative director of Prada with Raf Simons), ultimately rising to become her second in command before decamping to Versace. He is effectively coming home.</p><p>Capri, on the other hand, has a much shorter genealogy. The group was created in 2018 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/business/dealbook/michael-kors-versace.html" title="">Michael Kors bought Versace</a> for $2.1 billion, following its acquisition of Jimmy Choo. At the time, crowed chief executive John Idol, the Versace deal signaled “our latest step in creating one of the world’s leading fashion and luxury groups.”</p><p>Now Mr. Guerra of Prada might say something similar.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vanessa Friedman has been the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times since 2014.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Scolded for a Sip of Water: </strong>Online grandstanding, intergenerational head-butting and a lost job, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/style/bode-nyc-hot-yoga-water-tiktok.html">all thanks to one poorly timed water break</a> during a hot yoga class.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being ‘Natty’?: </strong>The fitness influencer Kenny Boulet, who asks gymgoers if their muscles are natural or not, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/style/kenny-boulet-natty-steroids-videos.html">wants people to be more honest about steroids</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forever 21: </strong>Anything the fast-fashion retailer lacked in cool or quality it made up for with the thrill of the hunt for the right thing — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/style/forever-21-bankruptcy-fast-fashion.html">or something close enough</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving a Dive Bar: </strong>When Lucy’s, a homey New York tavern, closed down and underwent a renovation, some longtime patrons feared the worst.
