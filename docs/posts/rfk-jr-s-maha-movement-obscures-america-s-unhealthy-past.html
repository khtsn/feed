Was there ever really a time when America was healthier?</p><p>For historians of medicine, there is a short answer.</p><p>“No,” said Nancy Tomes, a historian at Stony Brook University.</p><p>John Harley Warner, a historian at Yale, said, “It’s hard for me to think of a time when America, with all the real health disparities that characterize our system, was healthier.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dr. Jeremy Greene, a historian at Johns Hopkins University, asked: “Which particular era does R.F.K. want to take us back to?”</p><p>Probably not the 19th and early 20th century.</p><p>Rich men smoked cigarettes and cigars, the poor chewed tobacco. Heavy drinking was the norm.</p><p>“It was definitely a drinking culture,” said Dora Costa, an economic historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Drinking was a huge problem, saloons were a huge concern. Men were drinking away their paychecks. That is the reason we had Prohibition.”</p><p>And, Dr. Costa notes, American diets for most of the 19th century were monotonous.</p><p>It’s true that agriculture at the time was organic, food was locally produced and there were no ultraprocessed foods. But fresh fruits and vegetables were in short supply because they were difficult to ship and because growing seasons were so short. For the most part, Dr. Costa said, until the 1930s, “Americans were living off of dried fruits and vegetables.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As for protein, Americans were relying on salted pork, she said, because meat was difficult to preserve. Only after the Civil War did meatpackers in Chicago begin to process meat and ship fresh beef across the country.

Common conditions, like hernias, were untreatable — men had hernias as big as grapefruits, held in by trusses. Nineteen percent of those soldiers had heart valve problems by the time they were 60, compared <a href="https://www.agingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Silver-Book-Valve-Disease-VOLUME-Final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with about 8.5 percent today</a>.</p><p>Poor nutrition led to poor health. People were thin, often too thin. In 1900, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.53.3.503" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">6.1 percent</a> of Union Army veterans were underweight — a risk factor for various illnesses and often a marker of ill health — compared <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/underweight-adult-17-18/underweight-adult.htm#:~:text=Poor%20nutrition%20or%20underlying%20health,20%20and%20over%20are%20underweight" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with 1.6 percent</a> of U.S. adults today.

Today it is <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">74 years</a>.</p><p>The start of the 20th century saw public health improvements (cleaner water, for example, and posters advising parents not to give their babies beer), but disease was rampant. There were no antibiotics and very few vaccines. When the 1918 flu struck the nation, no one knew the cause — the flu virus had not been discovered and strange folk remedies were rampant. <a href="https://www.paho.org/en/who-we-are/history-paho/purple-death-great-flu-1918" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">About 675,000 Americans died</a>.

Now an array of targeted therapies are turning some cancers, once deadly, into treatable chronic diseases or even curing them.</p><p>Dr. Greene said he was not surprised by the idea of a halcyon past when people were healthier.</p><p>“There’s a long history in America of nostalgia for a past that was better than the present,” he said. “History is all about erasure — the things we don’t choose to remember.”</p><p>Today is not a sort of health utopia, of course.</p><p>Researchers are quick to acknowledge that Americans’ health is not as good as it can be.
