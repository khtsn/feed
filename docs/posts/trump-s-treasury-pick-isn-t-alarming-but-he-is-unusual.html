    <h1>Trump’s Treasury Pick Isn’t Alarming, but He Is Unusual</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Scott Bessent, Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, has some pretty unorthodox views. Unorthodoxy can be a good thing at times, and it’s conceivable that Bessent will end up a big success at Treasury. But deviation from the norm is not necessarily what you look for in a Treasury secretary, who is <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/subfooter/faqs/duties-and-functions-faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responsible</a> for formulating the nation’s economic, financial and tax policies. </p><p>What Bessent stands for hasn’t gotten a lot of attention yet because he is a levelheaded, stable, congenial person, which puts him way above some of the other Trump picks. He’s also smart and knows his way around financial markets, a plus for the job. He became a billionaire by working for the prominent investors George Soros, Jim Chanos and Jim Rogers, and later founding Key Square Capital Management, a hedge fund.</p><p>But when you listen to him closely, you hear some surprising things. Let me take you through one <a href="https://www.simplify.us/news-media/entering-the-fall-2024?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fireside chat</a> that Bessent had on Oct. 2 — that is, before Trump chose him, but while he was in contention for the job — with Michael Green, the chief strategist of Simplify Asset Management.</p><p>At one point, the conversation turned to Japan. Its central bank has kept interest rates low to stimulate its economy, going by the conventional economic wisdom that raising rates discourages borrowing by consumers and businesses, chilling growth. After two increases earlier this year, it has been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boj-rate-hike-bets-month-004947629.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reluctant</a> to raise rates further. But Bessent told Green, “I believe that the Bank of Japan is actually going to stoke growth when they raise rates.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Bessent’s logic is that Japanese households are big savers, and keep a lot of their money in bank accounts, so when rates go up, their interest income rises, allowing them to spend more. Himino Ryozo, a deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, said something along those lines in <a href="https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/press/koen_2023/data/ko231206a1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a speech</a> last year, although that was back when its key interest rate was <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/interest-rate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still negative</a>. It’s also a tenet of modern monetary theory, a heterodox school of economics.</p><p>There’s no question that savers benefit from higher interest rates, but to say that higher rates stimulate the Japanese economy overall remains a minority view, even within the Bank of Japan. (Otherwise they would have raised rates sooner and faster, right?)</p><p>Maurice Obstfeld, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund from 2015 to 2018, pointed out to me that households that owe money tend to live more paycheck to paycheck, so the hit to their spending from higher interest payments is greater than the lift to spending by saving households, which will just put most of the extra interest back into the bank.</p><p>Bessent also told Green that China can accomplish its military buildup only because it has a gigantic surplus in trade and income from investments — the current account, in economics lingo. “If they didn’t do the gigantic current account surplus, the savings of the Chinese people are not enough to finance this,” he said.</p><p>This is precisely backward. China’s having a surplus in its current account means that it is actually sending savings abroad, not adding to national savings that could be used for the military or anything else. The surplus indicates that instead of importing foreign goods in exchange for its exports, China is acquiring foreign stocks, bonds, real estate and the like. That, in fact, is the complaint that the current Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has been making about China ever since she took office — that China is <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2241" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overproducing and over-saving</a>, so “the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Perhaps Bessent’s argument is that China’s current account surplus and its military buildup are two symptoms of deeper problems in economic management, rather than the former enabling the latter. I’m not sure I buy that either, but in any case it’s not what he said.</p><p>One more surprising argument. Late in the fireside chat, Bessent floated an idea for how to get NATO countries to pay their fair share for defense, without threatening to withdraw from the alliance, as Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html" title="">privately talked about</a>. His idea was to ask Germany and other allies to buy U.S. “military bonds.” </p><p>It sounds reasonable at first, but think about what it entails. It’s Europe buying a new form of U.S. government debt. Instead of using its money to buy jets, tanks and the like (a lot of it American-made), Europe would be turning the United States into even more of a net debtor to the rest of the world than it already is. How does that help Europe defend itself or benefit America’s finances?</p><p>There’s also Bessent’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/dealbook/markets-trump-treasury-bessent.html" title="">3-3-3</a> plan, which helped him get Trump’s nod for the job. It would involve cutting the budget deficit to 3 percent by 2028, from roughly 6 percent today, boosting economic growth to 3 percent a year, and encouraging additional energy production of three million barrels of oil a day or the equivalent. Its goals are good but I think it’s overoptimistic, especially if Trump follows through on his vows to impose higher tariffs and to expel millions of undocumented immigrants. To his credit, Bessent has expressed concerns about high tariffs, saying they should be used more as threats to gain concessions from other nations rather than as permanent fixtures.</p><p>All that said, Bessent is better prepared to serve as Treasury secretary than some of his predecessors. I remember when Paul O’Neill, a former chief executive of the aluminum producer Alcoa, who served under President George W. Bush, said that one of his top priorities as Treasury secretary would be workplace safety. (That’s more the Labor Department’s department.) Bessent may turn out just fine. Some of his ideas, however, could use a little more thinking through.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-28f264b4">The Readers Write</h2><p>You wrote about organizations that help <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/opinion/charity-holiday-gift-jobs-employment.html" title="">get people into good jobs</a>. My thought is to have companies hire part-time workers. As a senior with a doctorate in biostatistics, I would be happy to work only 20 or 25 hours per week, even at lower pay, if I can use my skills. I have Medicare so I don’t need benefits. At the same time, hire a young person at least part-time and let me job-share. I can show them how to do the work and be a mentor.</p><p>David Olsen</p><p>All those applicants mentioned who “didn’t get a nibble” are probably not victims of qualitative individual decisions but the faulty quantitative systems that are today’s gatekeepers into corporate hiring (alluded to in your inclusion of fear of “lemons”).</p><p>Blane Cox</p><p>One of the best things people can do to help others get jobs is help them practice interviewing. This takes time, a Zoom link or a cup of coffee at the local coffee shop. Do this three or four times and the person will show dramatic improvement.</p><p>Robin Hurley</p><p>Any day we are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/opinion/economics-business-risk.html" title="">talking about Frank Knight</a> is a good day for me (working on trying to understand Knight since before my 1980 Ph.D.). I agree absolutely with Amar Bhidé’s desire to change the Knightian intuition into something workable. Anything we can do here is huge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>John-Christopher Spender</p><p>You wrote about a theory for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/opinion/democrats-economy-election.html" title="">why Donald Trump was elected</a>. The working class is looking to Trump to give them a proportionately bigger piece of the American pie. Ironically, this has been Bernie Sanders’s message for years.</p><p>Whit Manter</p><p>My theory is that the “good economy” of the past four years was mostly enjoyed by those who were already in the well-off to wealthy segment. Those less privileged lost ground and they know it and they are upset. They turned against the party that is in power since it is easy to blame and hasn’t shown much empathy for the “average Joe.” </p><p>Branch Watkins</p><hr/><h2 id="link-2dda55ad">Quote of the Day</h2><p>“When it comes to governing the digital economy, it is not the E.U. that will be forced to choose between China and the U.S., but rather the U.S. that must choose between joining forces with the E.U. or allowing China’s influence to further grow.”</p><p>— Anu Bradford, “Digital Empires: The Global Battle to Regulate Technology” (2023) </p></div></div></section></article></div>
