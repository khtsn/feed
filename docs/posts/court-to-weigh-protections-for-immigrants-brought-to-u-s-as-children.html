But the Obama-era initiative was intended to be a short-term fix until Congress overhauled the nation’s outdated immigration system.</p><p>The country is still waiting, and the system has grown only more dysfunctional, even as international migration becomes more complex and the issue becomes more politicized. With Congress unwilling to act, battles over immigration policy have increasingly ended up in the federal courts.</p><p>The current lawsuit over DACA, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/daca-lawsuit-texas.html" title="">filed in 2018</a> by Texas and six other Republican-controlled states, argues that the creation of the program represented an overreach of presidential authority and imposed undue costs on the states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Justice Department is defending DACA, joined by a host of other parties, including the State of New Jersey and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. The tech giants Apple, Google and Microsoft are backing the effort to preserve DACA, too, noting that the program’s recipients benefit the economy and arguing that presidents have the power to defer the enforcement of immigration laws.</p><p>Arguments in the case are scheduled to be heard on Thursday in New Orleans by a panel of three judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The court, which covers Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, is known as one of the most aggressively conservative in the country. It upheld <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/health/abortion-pill-ruling.html" title="">a partial ban</a> on the abortion drug mifepristone, a ruling that the Supreme Court reversed.</p><p>The judges hearing the DACA challenge will consider three questions — whether the plaintiff states have shown that the program actually costs the states money; whether the Biden administration was acting within its authority in 2022 when it sought to “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01769/preserving-and-fortifying-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">preserve and fortify</a>” DACA with a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/30/2022-18401/deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals#footnote-29-p53155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">formal rule</a>; and whether the trial court, which blocked new applicants to the program nationwide, should have limited its ruling to the seven states that sued.</p><p>The states will argue that they have borne financial and other costs of a program that they consider unlawful.</p><p>The states said in a brief filed earlier this year that “because presidents cannot unilaterally override duly enacted statutes, DACA remains illegal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Those defending the program will argue that the president had the authority to create the program and that the executive branch can exercise discretion in immigration matters.</p><p>Under the program, the government granted a reprieve from deportation and work permits to unauthorized immigrants who were under the age of 31, had lived in the country since they were children and met other requirements. Beneficiaries must renew their status every two years.</p><p>Since DACA took effect 12 years ago, some 800,000 people have registered and a vast majority have renewed. After new applications were halted by the judge’s ruling in 2021, the number of enrollees dropped sharply. It currently stands at about half a million. Experts attribute the decline in renewals to the program’s uncertain future.</p><p>President Barack Obama started the program in 2012 after legislation known as the Dream Act, which would have given legal status to young immigrants, stalled in Congress.</p><p>He described it as a stopgap measure to protect some of the nation’s most vulnerable immigrants — those who had been brought to the United States as children through no choice of their own and had grown up as Americans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The initiative proved hugely popular, and a long-term solution never materialized in a divided Congress, even though the undocumented young people had support from lawmakers and Americans across the political spectrum.</p><p>Then, in 2017, the Trump moved to kill DACA, under the premise that it went outside the executive branch’s constitutional powers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/us/daca-immigration-what-next.html" title="">The program has been suspended, reinstated and partly rolled back</a> by court rulings ever since.</p><p>In June 2020, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/trump-daca-supreme-court.html" title="">the Supreme Court ruled</a> against the Trump administration’s decision to terminate the program, deeming the move “arbitrary and capricious.” But the court did not rule on the core issue of whether the program itself was lawful.</p><p>A federal judge in Texas, Andrew S. Hanen, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/court-daca-dreamers.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">ruled in 2021 that DACA was unlawful</a>, saying that President Obama, in creating DACA, had exceeded his authority and run afoul of procedures for new regulations. The judge allowed current recipients to keep renewing every two years but barred the government from processing new applications.</p><p>The Biden administration put in place a formal rule for the program, hoping to address some of Judge Hanen’s concerns. But, in September 2023, he held that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/us/daca-immigration-ruling.html" title="">DACA was still unlawful</a>, prompting the appeal that the three-judge panel will consider this week in New Orleans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>None of the judges hearing the appeal this week are among Mr. Trump’s six nominees to the Fifth Circuit. But one of them, Judge Jerry E. Smith, wrote the <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C15/15-40238-CV0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">majority opinion</a> in a Fifth Circuit appeal that blocked a similar Obama-era program for the undocumented parents of immigrants.<span>  </span>The Fifth Circuit has already <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/21/21-40680-CV0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pared back</a> DACA in the past, upholding a lower-court ruling in a different case that barred the Department of Homeland Security from accepting new DACA applications.</p><p>The legal fight over DACA comes as the politics around immigration are far more polarized than when the program began. Mr. Trump has made threats of mass deportations a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Even as Democrats denounce Mr. Trump’s incendiary anti-immigrant falsehoods, the party has tacked to the right on policy, with President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/briefing/biden-immigration-election.html" title="">tightening the rules</a> on asylum and allowing a different <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/biden-will-allow-legal-status-to-lapse-for-migrants-from-4-countries.html" title="">two-year program</a> for some immigrants to lapse.</p><p>In the case before the Fifth Circuit, it could take weeks or months before the court issues a decision. Even if the appellate court rules the program is unlawful, it is unlikely to end immediately. Any ruling is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Beneficiaries of DACA were typically teenagers when they first received the status.</p><p>“The reality is that those folks are now adults who have careers,” said Bruna Bouhid-Sollod, senior political director at United We Dream, an immigrant rights group founded by young immigrants. “They have families. They have responsibilities.”</p><p>Among them are lawyers, doctors and teachers. Nearly half of them are married and have a child born in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“An end to DACA is not just about the DACA recipients,” Ms. Bouhid-Sollod said. “It would have a ripple effect that would be catastrophic.”</p><p>Since 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/us/daca-dreamers-immigration-reform.html" title="">about 100,000 undocumented</a> students have graduated high school annually without being enrolled in DACA. They are not shielded from deportation and while they can attend college and earn a degree, they cannot work legally in the United States.</p><p>The number of undocumented students who enrolled at University of California and California State University campuses declined 50 percent between the 2016-17 and 2022-2023 academic years, according to a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4955086" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> by scholars at the ​​University of California Civil Rights Project at U.C.L.A. and the U.C. Davis School of Law.</p><p>The authors attributed the decline to the uncertainty over DACA’s future.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan">More about Miriam Jordan</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/andrew-hanen">Andrew Hanen</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Changes to Asylum Restrictions:</strong> The Biden administration is expected to take action to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/biden-asylum-border.html">make it harder to lift its policy banning asylum for migrants</a> who cross the southern border illegally.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Wisconsin City’s Saga:</strong> Eau Claire had a plan.
