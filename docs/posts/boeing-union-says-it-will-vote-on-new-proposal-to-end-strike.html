Within days of the walkout, Boeing announced cost-cutting measures, including temporary furloughs for tens of thousands of white-collar employees.</p><p>The proposal, which was agreed to after multiple rounds of failed talks, includes raises of <a href="https://www.iam751.org/2024StrikeProposal/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">35 percent</a> over the four-year life of the contract, according to details shared by the union. That’s an increase over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/business/economy/boeing-strike-contract-offer.html" title="">the previous proposal</a> but below the 40 percent the union had initially sought. It also includes a bonus of $7,000 should workers ratify the deal, and the reinstatement of performance bonuses that were set to be cut.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said that the vote on the proposal would take place on Wednesday.</p><p>In a statement, Boeing said, “We look forward to our employees voting on the negotiated proposal.”</p><p>If members vote for the contract, it would replace one that was agreed to in 2008 after a two-month strike. Boeing later said in securities filings that the strike contributed to decline in revenue that year of about $6.4 billion because it delivered 104 fewer planes than expected.</p><p>In its first week, the current strike cost the company at least $571 million, according to an analysis by Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research and consulting firm. I</p><p>The company said in regulatory filings on Tuesday that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/business/boeing-financing-strike.html" title="">could raise as much as $25 billion</a> by selling debt or stock over the next three years and that it had entered into a $10 billion credit agreement with a group of banks, an effort to improve its financial position as costs mounted. Earlier this month, the company announced a restructuring that included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/business/boeing-job-cuts.html" title="">plans to cut 17,000 jobs</a>, or 10 percent of its work force.</p><p>Washington State is home to most of Boeing’s commercial airplane production. It makes the 737 Max at a factory in Renton and the 767 and 777 in Everett. Boeing also produces the 787 Dreamliner at a factory in North Charleston, S.C., but workers there are not represented by a union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Max is by far Boeing’s most popular commercial plane, accounting for more than three-fourths of the approximately 5,500 planes in the company’s order book. But output is far lower than Boeing would like.</p><p>The company was forced to slow production of the jet to make quality improvements after a panel fell off a Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, renewing concerns about Boeing’s commitment to quality and safety five years after two fatal crashes involving the 737 Max.</p><p>Airline executives say they are pleased with the progress Boeing has made since that January flight, but the strike represented a setback for the company and its new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, a former leader of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, who joined Boeing in August.</p><p>When they put the previous contract offer to a membership vote, union leaders described the proposal in glowing terms. That proposal included a 25 percent raise, an increase in 401(k) contributions from Boeing and a commitment to build a new commercial plane in the Seattle area. But more than 95 percent of members who voted on the deal rejected it.</p><p>When negotiations began in March, the union said it was seeking a 40 percent raise and the reinstatement of pension benefits lost nearly a decade ago, an important issue for many workers. Union members are also resentful of Boeing’s decision to move the assembly of the 787 from Washington to South Carolina.</p><p>Boeing employs more than 66,000 people in Washington, but supports more than twice as many jobs in the state when considering its effect on other businesses, according to <a href="https://www.seattlechamber.com/clientuploads/Documents/Advocacy%20Documents/CAI.Seattle_Chamber_Aerospace_Impacts.2024_0725.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce</a>. The company paused spending on parts after the strike began.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
