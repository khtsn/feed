The jury began deliberations on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Allen is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 20 and could face up to 130 years in prison.</p><p>During the trial, prosecutors told the jury that Mr. Allen planned to rape the girls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prosecutors also said Mr. Allen had admitted to killing the girls, including in one statement where he said he killed the girls with a box cutter.</p><p>But Mr. Allen’s lawyers cast doubt on these admissions in part by arguing that Mr. Allen suffered mentally while being held in solitary confinement, The A.P. said.</p><p>Bradley Rozzi, one of Mr. Allen’s lawyers, said that no fingerprint, DNA or forensic evidence linked Mr. Allen to the murder scene.</p><p>Mr. Rozzi also cast doubt on a bullet that was linked to Mr. Allen. Mr. Rozzi did not respond to a request seeking comment.</p><p>According to court records and prosecutors, on Feb. 13 at 1:49 p.m., the girls were dropped off at an entrance of a hiking trail near Monon High Bridge in Delphi on the last day of their four-day winter break from middle school.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During their hike, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/us/delphi-murders-indiana.html" title="">video captured</a> on one of their phones showed them being followed by a man in a dark jacket and jeans.</p><p>One of the girls mentioned a “gun” and a man’s voice was heard ordering them to go “down the hill,” according to an affidavit filed by a detective with the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Richard Allen is escorted out of the courthouse in Carroll County in Delphi, Ind., in November 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Darron Cummings/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>An unspent round from a .40-caliber gun was found near the girls’ bodies, the affidavit said.</p><p>During their investigation, detectives interviewed multiple other hikers and witnesses who described seeing a man whose clothes and stature matched the man seen in the victims’ video, the affidavit said.</p><p>One person described him as “kind of creepy,” the document said. And another witness said the man’s clothes appeared to be bloody and covered in mud.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Investigators even interviewed Mr. Allen in 2017.

Investigators found a gun at Mr. Allen’s home that they determined to have at one point held the unspent round that was found near the victims’ bodies, the affidavit said.</p><p>When asked, Mr. Allen said he did not know why the bullet was found at the scene and denied being involved in the deaths of the two girls.</p><p>The so-called Delphi Murders have become the subject of public scrutiny as true crime fans analyzed the cellphone video and weighed in on the evidence against Mr. Allen.</p><p>Hidden True Crime, a YouTube channel with over 200,000 subscribers, reviewed a day of the trial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPkc6ufwx9Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during a livestream</a> that had nearly 90,000 viewers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It’s just this small town in the middle of nowhere,” <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/05NNftx1ghXnguEFwlEzAE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the trailer</a> of “Down The Hill: The Delphi Murders,” a podcast covering the case, said over an ominous soundtrack.</p><p>Members of the public appeared outside the Carroll County Courthouse, as jurors deliberated inside.
