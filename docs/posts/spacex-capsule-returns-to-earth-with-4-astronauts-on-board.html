On board were Mr. Isaacman, the mission commander and the founder of the payment services company <a href="https://www.shift4.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shift4</a>; Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, SpaceX employees; and Scott Poteet, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Late on Tuesday, its orbit reached <a href="https://nytimes.com/2024/09/10/science/polaris-dawn-spacex-orbit-astronauts.html" title="">a high point of about 870 miles</a> above the Earth’s surface. That beat the record distance for astronauts on a mission not headed to the moon, which the Gemini XI mission set in 1966 at 853 miles high, and made Ms. Gillis and Ms. Menon the first women ever to fly so far from Earth.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Isaacman and Ms. Gillis became the first private astronauts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/science/spacex-polaris-dawn-astronauts-spacewalk.html" title="">successfully complete a spacewalk</a>. The operation involved the crew letting all the air out of the spacecraft, because it had no airlock, while the other two crew members wore spacesuits inside the airless capsule. Mr. Isaacman moved outside and conducted mobility tests of his spacesuit for a few minutes before re-entering the capsule. Ms Gillis then moved outside and performed the same tests.</p><p>This was the first of three Polaris missions aimed at accelerating technological advances needed to fulfill Mr. Musk’s dream of sending people to Mars someday. A key goal of the mission was to further the development of more advanced spacesuits that would be needed for SpaceX to try any future off-world colonization.</p><p>During a news conference before the launch, Mr. Isaacman mused that one day, someone might step onto Mars wearing a version of the spacesuit that SpaceX had developed for this flight. Closer to Earth, commercial spacewalks also present other possibilities, like technicians repairing private satellites in orbit.</p><p>During the spaceflight, the four astronauts conducted about 40 experiments, mostly about how weightlessness and radiation affect the human body. They also tested laser communications between the Crew Dragon and SpaceX’s constellation of Starlink internet satellites.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/science/space-astronomy-events-2024.html">2024 event</a> that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/01/01/science/astronomy-space-calendar">our space and astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore of NASA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/science/boeing-starliner-astronauts-wilmore-williams.html">spoke from the International Space Station for the first time</a> since their Boeing orbital transport returned to Earth uncrewed.</p></li><li><p>Two astronauts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/science/spacex-polaris-dawn-launch-spacewalk.html">aboard an ambitious private space mission</a> moved outside their spacecraft, conducting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/science/spacex-polaris-dawn-astronauts-spacewalk.html">first-ever commercial spacewalk</a>.
