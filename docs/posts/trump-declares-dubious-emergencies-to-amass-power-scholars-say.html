When he took office the first time, he promised to end “American carnage.” When he announced his most recent re-election campaign, he said he would reverse “staggering American decline.” Ever since he first ran for president in 2015, he has argued that only he can restore the country to greatness.</p><p>Now in office again, he is converting that rhetoric into policy. Mr. Trump says that events and circumstances largely considered routine amount to emergencies that allow him to invoke powers rarely sought by his predecessors but embedded in statutes by lawmakers who wanted to ensure presidents could act quickly and aggressively to confront authentic crises.</p><p>Frank O. Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri, said the laws Mr. Trump has invoked were premised on a presumption that the flexibility they granted would not be abused.</p><p>“Genuine emergencies do occur, and Congress knows that it’s slow,” Professor Bowman said. “It wants presidents acting in good faith to move with rapidity.”</p><p>But Professor Bowman said Mr. Trump’s approach was different. “Declaring everything an emergency begins to move us in the direction of allowing the use of government force and violence against people you don’t like,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a statement, the White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said that Democrats had failed “to protect Americans from economic and national security threats — inaction that has resulted in serious crises.”</p><p>“President Trump is rightfully using his executive authority — as evidenced by many victories in court — to deliver resolve and relief for the American people,” she said.</p><p>In fact, lower courts have for the most part rejected Mr. Trump’s assertions of emergency powers.</p><p>In March, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/alien-enemies-act-trump.html" title="">Mr. Trump invoked</a> the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which grants the president the power to deport citizens of nations engaged in war, invasion or “predatory incursion,” arguing that Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang, was invading the United States. The law had been used just three times before, in the War of 1812, in World War I and in World War II.</p><p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.640153/gov.uscourts.nysd.640153.84.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Several</a> judges <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.2000771/gov.uscourts.txsd.2000771.58.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have</a> now <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2025/04/23/federal-district-court-rules-against-trump-in-alien-enemies-act-case/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rejected</a> the idea that the gang’s activities justified the use of the law.</p><p>There is nothing in the 1798 law, <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/hellerstein-alvin-k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge Alvin K.

In the past, the justices have at times been skeptical of such claims. They did not hesitate, for instance, to reject President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s invocations of the Covid pandemic to take emergency actions.</p><p>In 2023, the court ruled that Mr. Biden had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/us/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-biden.html" title="">overstepped his authority</a> in canceling some $400 billion in student debt based on a 2003 law that gave the executive branch the power to protect borrowers affected by “a war or other military operation or national emergency.”</p><p>In 2018, on the other hand, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html" title="">upheld Mr. Trump’s travel ban</a> from several predominantly Muslim countries, discounting his history of incendiary statements about the emergency the nation faced, one he said warranted a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”</p><p>In his majority opinion, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. cited an immigration law that gives presidents the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens” as they see necessary.</p><p>The provision “exudes deference to the president in every clause,” the chief justice said.</p><p>The court will soon rule on a case arising from an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> issued by Mr. Trump seeking to do away with birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents. Though the court’s decision is not likely to reach the constitutionality of the order and will focus instead on the scope of the lower-court rulings blocking it, the order’s proponents have also invoked the idea that the president’s action was justified by an invasion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/ho-james-c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge James C. Ho</a>, who was appointed by Mr. Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and has been mentioned as a candidate for the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.gibsondunn.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/publications/Ho-DefiningAmerican.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in 2006 that birthright citizenship “is protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers.”</p><p>But in <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2024/11/11/an-interview-with-judge-james-c-ho/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview in November</a>, he seemed to recede from that view. “Birthright citizenship obviously doesn’t apply in case of war or invasion,” he said. “No one to my knowledge has ever argued that the children of invading aliens are entitled to birthright citizenship. And I can’t imagine what the legal argument for that would be.”</p><p>Two notable provisions of the Constitution discuss invasions. One prohibits states from engaging in war “unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.” The other says that “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.”</p><p>Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and Mr. Trump’s top immigration adviser, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/trump-habeas-corpus.html" title="">said last month</a> that the administration was considering suspending habeas corpus — the fundamental right to challenge government detentions.</p><p>“That’s an option we’re actively looking at,” he said, adding, “A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.” (The overwhelming scholarly and judicial consensus is that such a move would require congressional action.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The court’s most significant ruling on a president’s emergency powers came in its 1952 decision in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer</a>, which rejected President Harry S. Truman’s claim that a national emergency — there, the Korean War — allowed him to nationalize steel mills in the face of labor strikes.</p><p>The decision included a canonical concurrence from Justice Robert H. Jackson, a touchstone that Supreme Court nominees routinely praise at their confirmation hearings.</p><p>Justice Jackson wrote that the framers of the Constitution were wary of granting the president emergency powers.</p><p>“They knew what emergencies were, knew the pressures they engender for authoritative action, knew, too, how they afford a ready pretext for usurpation,” he wrote. “We may also suspect that they suspected that emergency powers would tend to kindle emergencies.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
