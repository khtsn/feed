Israeli news outlets have reported that his car was found abandoned in Al Ain, a city in the adjacent emirate of Abu Dhabi, on the border with Oman. His body was found on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The rabbi, a dual citizen of Israel and Moldova, worked in the Emirates as part of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a Hasidic branch of Orthodox Judaism that conducts Jewish outreach around the world. He also helped manage a kosher supermarket in Dubai’s affluent Al Wasl road neighborhood.</p><p>An Israeli Foreign Ministry official told The New York Times that the Israeli government hoped a forensic examination of the rabbi’s body could be completed on Monday, after which it would be flown back to Jerusalem for a funeral as soon as Tuesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.</p><p>The rabbi was likely targeted because he was one of the more visible members of the Jewish community, the Israeli official said.</p><p>More Israelis and Jews have called the Emirates their home since the oil-rich country formally established ties with Israel in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-israel-united-arab-emirates-uae.html" title="">2020 Abraham Accords</a>. The Emirates has presented itself as a tolerant country open to multiple faiths.
