Israeli news outlets have reported that his car was found abandoned in Al Ain, a city in the adjacent emirate of Abu Dhabi, on the border with Oman. His body was found on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The rabbi, a dual citizen of Israel and Moldova, worked in the Emirates as part of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a Hasidic branch of Orthodox Judaism that conducts Jewish outreach around the world. He also helped manage a kosher supermarket in Dubai’s affluent Al Wasl road neighborhood.</p><p>The rabbi’s body was flown back to Israel on Monday night and taken to Kfar Chabad, a Lubavitch town in central Israel. A funeral service was held there in the open air, to accommodate a large crowd, with a steady rain falling.</p><p>The rabbi was probably targeted because he was one of the more visible members of the Jewish community, the Israeli official said.</p><p>More Israelis and Jews have called the Emirates their home since the oil-rich country formally established ties with Israel in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-israel-united-arab-emirates-uae.html" title="">2020 Abraham Accords</a>. The Emirates has presented itself as a tolerant country open to multiple faiths.
