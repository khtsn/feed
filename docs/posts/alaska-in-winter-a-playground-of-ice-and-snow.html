Snow packed the slumping branches of towering pines and frosted the beards of draping moss. From the chairlift, skiers below me appeared from the thighs up, their lower halves plowing fresh tracks. Whoops of delight rang out from sources unseen.</p><p>Dropping into an intermediate run, I fought the pull of the depths and managed to surf the soft mantle in a joyous ride — whooping all the way.</p><p>Powder days, I always thought, were for locals and, occasionally, lucky visitors. After all, it’s hard to schedule a trip around an unpredictable snowstorm far enough in advance to get decent airfare.</p><p>To boost my luck last winter, I relocated to Juneau, the capital of Alaska, for a month. Though better known as a cruise port welcoming 1.6 million ship passengers annually between May and October, it’s also a ski town in the low (and budget-friendly) season.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Climate-wise, Juneau is renowned for rain.

I booked a one-bedroom <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/53156794" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> for $100 a night, which goes for $175 in summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Home to about 32,000 residents, the state capital has a life apart from tourism. While the cruise docks and neighboring souvenir and jewelry shops stand empty for months, Juneau’s historic downtown core — wedged between the sheer slopes of Mount Roberts and Mount Juneau along the Gastineau Channel — remains lively. Lawmakers, lobbyists and the like come for the legislative season, January through April, which helps keep the walkable downtown flush.</p><h3 id="link-740f5bd2"><span><strong>‘Rip the pow’</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A skier takes a turn on a black diamond run at Eaglecrest Ski Area.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Miller for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Located on mountainous Douglas Island across the channel from Juneau, Eaglecrest, with four lifts, 36 marked trails and a 1,620-foot vertical drop, is small by most mountain resort standards.
