    <h1>South Korea’s Ex-Defense Chief Is Detained Over Martial Law Episode</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was unclear whether Mr. Kim had a legal representative. Before his arrest, in an interview with the daily Dong-A Ilbo, he said he had been involved in Mr. Yoon’s declaration of martial law, but that it was imposed according to legal procedures.</p><p>​For most of the two and a half years he has been in office, Mr. Yoon has endured low approval ratings and been in a near-constant political standoff with the opposition. They have tussled especially over his refusal to accept their demands that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate allegations of corruption involving his wife.</p><p>Mr. Yoon said in his surprise announcement late Tuesday that he was declaring martial law to rid the National Assembly of “shameless North Korean followers and anti-state forces.”</p><p>On Saturday, he apologized for his “desperate” action. He also offered a compromise: he said he would leave it to his People Power Party, or P.P.P., to decide how long he should remain in office and how the government should be run. That compromise helped his party’s leadership to decide to boycott the impeachment vote. All but three of the 108 P.P.P. lawmakers joined the boycott, saving Mr. Yoon from impeachment.</p><p>But ​his failed martial law​, the first effort to impose military rule in South Korea in more than four decades, triggered a series of lawsuits by the opposition.</p></div></div>
