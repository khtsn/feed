		<p>for speaking the truth. Boaster just had the worst international playoff performance in VCT history, literally. Like you can go back and check on each one if you want to. There’s no wonder why Alfajer Chronicle Derke placed 6th in their peak form.</p>

		<p>Boaster had one bad year while Tenz had 2 bad years. He wasnt as bad as Boaster was in 2024 but he was close to it in 2023 while Boaster had a phenomenal 2023 with most clutches.</p>

			<p>FACT: the 2nd worst international playoff rating ever in VCT belongs to Boaster at a staggering 0.55. </p>
<p>FACT: Despite Xeppaa having a lower playoff rating for Champs 2021 at a 0.46, Boaster manages to uphold his 0.55 across 7 maps compared to Xeppaa’s 2, all while being carried by a SIGNIFICANTLY better team and of course the two highest rated players of Champs 2024 playoffs, Chronicle and Derke (with Alfajer at #8).</p>
<p>With all the facts considered, Boaster has officially earned the title of being the worst player ever to step foot onto a playoff international VCT event!  </p>		</div>

<li>Why filter out only playoff stages and showcasing stats? Isnt this deliberate nitpicking?</li>
<li>How does it matter if a player had better team?</li>
<li>Aren&#39;t you a hypocrite for first mentioning stats about playoff stages only and proceeded</li>
</ol>
<p>I mean SEN fans are delusional but you seem to be rarest among them. And bro not every team makes it to playoffs of almost all international VCT events. Especially not those who ghosted the scene for good 2 years lol. </p>
<p>Even to be the worst player in playoff stages, you need to qualify to playoffs first.</p>		</div>

		<p>I dont like calling people silver, but if you guys would even know something about fnatic and esports in general you would know that boaster is one of the most valuable players maybe even the most valuable one. He puts so much time in anti-stratting the enemy, creating stategies and making mid round decisions that he doesnt really have to frag that much.</p>
