Trump, has been trying to establish the cornerstone of an unusual family compound, according to four people familiar with his plans.</p><p>Mr. Musk has told people close to him in recent months that he envisions his children (of which there are at least 11) and two of their three mothers occupying adjoining properties. That way, his younger children could be a part of one another’s lives, and Mr. Musk could schedule time among them.</p><p>Directly behind the villa is a six-bedroom mansion that Mr. Musk helped purchase, according to two of the people and public records. The total cost of both properties was about $35 million. When in Austin, he often stays at a third mansion about a 10-minute walk away, the people said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Three mansions, three mothers, 11 children and one secretive, multibillionaire father who obsesses about declining birthrates when he isn’t overseeing one of his six companies: It is an unconventional family situation, and one that Mr. Musk seems to want to make even bigger.</p><p>A proponent of in vitro fertilization, Mr. Musk believes strongly in increasing the world’s population. He has even offered his own sperm to friends and acquaintances, including the former independent vice-presidential candidate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/technology/nicole-shanahan-rfk-jr-vp.html" title="">Nicole Shanahan</a>, according to two people familiar with his offer. Ms. Shanahan turned him down.</p><p>Mr. Musk has tried to keep his own growing family a secret. The compound, and his efforts to fill it with his children, which have not been previously reported, isn’t just a personal matter for him; it is rooted in the existential anxieties that underpin his business empire.</p><p>He was an early investor in his electric car company, Tesla, out of concerns about reliance on fossil fuels. He founded his rocket company, SpaceX, now a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" title="">significant government contractor,</a> so that he could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/technology/elon-musk-spacex-mars.html" title="">colonize Mars</a> for humans in case Earth becomes uninhabitable.</p><p>Over the last two years, he has become increasingly fixated on what he sees as another threat: declining birthrates. He believes a global population collapse is coming that will wipe out humanity. His apocalyptic vision is unlikely, according to demographers, but on X, the social media company he owns, he has been encouraging followers to have as many children as possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It should be considered a national emergency to have kids,” Mr. Musk posted in June.</p><p>For the moment, Mr. Musk is temporarily encamped in Pennsylvania, immersed in the presidential campaign and spending tens of millions of dollars to finance Mr. Trump’s get-out-the-vote operations. A Trump victory could make Mr. Musk perhaps the most powerful private citizen in the country, and Mr. Trump has already said he would appoint the billionaire to oversee an “efficiency commission” to scrutinize the workings of the entire federal government.</p><p>But it is in Texas where Mr. Musk has moved much of his business operations and is trying to establish his family compound. The compound is off to a bumpy start.</p><p>One of the mothers, Shivon Zilis, an executive at Neuralink, Mr. Musk’s brain technology start-up, has moved into one of the homes with her children. But Claire Boucher, the musician better known as Grimes, who is the mother to three of his children, is in a protracted legal fight with Mr. Musk and has so far steered clear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/28/business/MUSK-COMPOUND-VShivon-Zilis/MUSK-COMPOUND-VShivon-Zilis-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/28/business/MUSK-COMPOUND-VShivon-Zilis/MUSK-COMPOUND-VShivon-Zilis-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/28/business/MUSK-COMPOUND-VShivon-Zilis/MUSK-COMPOUND-VShivon-Zilis-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Shivon Zilis looks at the camera while sitting at a work table with one hand on a laptop computer and her other hand holding a white mug.

I’m just saying that smart people should have kids as well,” he said. “I notice that a lot of really smart women have zero or one kid. You’re like, ‘Wow, that’s probably not good.’”</p><p>His views seem to echo those of his father, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/world/africa/elon-musk-south-africa.html" title="">Errol Musk</a>. The elder Mr. Musk, who is 78 and has seven children with three women, praised his son’s “good genes” and desire to have many children.</p><p>“You breed horses,” Errol Musk said in an interview in September. “People are the same. If you have a good father and a good mother, you’ll have exceptional children. If you have no children, I feel very sorry for you.”</p><p>In a book published in 2023, Elon Musk told his biographer that he and his father, who lives in South Africa, are sometimes estranged, partly because Errol Musk had two children with his own former stepdaughter. But the elder Mr. Musk said that he and his son were in frequent contact and that he had recently traveled to Texas to visit him and his children.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I haven’t met one or two of them because they’re still secret,” the elder Mr. Musk said.</p><p>Mr. Musk, his attorney and the head of his family office did not return requests for comment.

Mr. Musk has said that I.V.F. is a more efficient way of having children because it allows parents to control parts of the process, according to a person who understands his thinking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>By 2016, as the head of Tesla and SpaceX, Mr. Musk had amassed a net worth of more than $11 billion, according to Forbes. That year, he warned for the first time on Twitter, the social network now known as X, that the world could be headed for population collapse.</p><p>“Consequences of population implosion greatly underestimated,” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/799906894550700032" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in response</a> to an article about falling birthrates. In private, he had warned of the issue to his friends and family for years.</p><p>He twice married and divorced the actress Talulah Riley, whose desire to focus on her career instead of having children was a factor in their breakup, according to three people familiar with her thinking. Representatives for Ms. Riley didn’t return requests for comment.</p><p>In 2020, Mr. Musk and Ms. Boucher, whom he started dating two years earlier, had their first child, a son they named X Æ A-Xii, or X for short.</p><p>He started becoming even more vocal about the declining population. “Population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after AI,” he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1283218156815699969?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> in July 2020, a couple of months after X’s birth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Over the next few years, Mr. Musk had more children with Ms. Boucher as well as with Ms. Zilis. The arrangement created tensions that sometimes flared on social media.</p><p>In 2021, without Ms. Boucher’s knowledge, Mr. Musk donated sperm to Ms. Zilis, who became pregnant with twins through I.V.F., according to three people familiar with the couple. That same year, the billionaire and Ms. Boucher were expecting a second child also conceived via I.V.F. but carried by a surrogate.</p><p>The two women, who had been friends and ran in similar social circles, had unknowingly been at the same Austin hospital around the same time, according to an authorized biography of Mr. Musk by Walter Isaacson. Ms. Zilis had twins in late 2021, weeks before Ms. Boucher’s child, a girl, was born. Ms. Boucher found out that Mr. Musk had fathered Ms. Zilis’s children a month after they were born, according to two people close to the situation.</p><p>Further complicating matters, Mr. Musk took a name that he and Ms. Boucher had chosen for their daughter — Valkyrie — and gave it to one of Ms. Zilis’s twins, according to two people familiar with the naming. Ms. Boucher was so offended that she wrote a song about the episode, which she posted to Twitter.</p><p>“A girl cursed with my daughter’s name,” Ms. Boucher wrote in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimes/comments/xcjn9c/who_do_we_think_s_is_deleted_tweet/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-deleted tweet</a>, “will now carry her mother’s shame.” (In the end, Ms. Zilis changed her daughter’s name, while Ms. Boucher chose a different name for her child.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>By then, Ms. Boucher was living in Austin and co-parenting her children with Mr. Musk.
