He will replace <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/business/dealbook/starbucks-ceo.html" title="">Laxman Narasimhan</a>, whose relatively brief tenure began in March last year, when he took over from Howard Schultz and became the first chief executive to come from outside the company. Mr. Niccol will also become board chairman. Starbucks’ chief financial officer, Rachel Ruggeri, will step in as interim chief executive until Sept. 9.</p><p>Analysts and investors largely cheered the move with Starbucks’ stock soaring more than 21 percent in morning trading.</p><p>The swift change in leadership at the coffee giant comes as it grapples with weakening results in some of its biggest markets, particularly the United States and China. Since the start of Mr. Narasimhan’s tenure, Starbucks shares have fallen more than 20 percent.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The steep drop in the stock and softening results in recent quarters had opened the door for activist investment groups to enter. Elliott Investment Management, which started building a position in the stock this summer, began pushing the company to make changes. Last week, a second activist group, Starboard Value, joined the fray.</p><p>The company framed the leadership change as led by its board of directors, not driven by the activist investors.</p><p>In an interview with CNBC, Mellody Hobson, who is stepping aside as board chair to become lead independent director in September when Mr. Niccol assumes his role, said the board started to consider a leadership change a couple months ago. It ultimately decided Mr. Niccol would be “the right leader for this moment” — and did not consult Elliott or other shareholders about the change, Ms. Hobson said.</p><p>“You can’t be a weather vane with all the people around you who have an opinion,” Ms. Hobson told CNBC, referring to opposition the company has faced in the past year. “They don’t know everything that you know sitting in the boardroom.”</p><p>In a statement, Elliott said it viewed the announcement “as a transformational step forward for the company.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The sudden leadership shift at Starbucks is not only a blemish for the board of directors, but also for Mr. Schultz, the company’s longtime leader and one of its largest individual shareholders.</p><p>Mr. Narasimhan, who is leaving Starbucks effective immediately, was handpicked by the board and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/business/dealbook/starbucks-ceo.html" title="">Mr. Schultz in the fall of 2022</a> after an exhaustive search. The former chief executive of Reckitt, which owns brands like Lysol and Air Wick, Mr. Narasimhan had little-to-no background in restaurant chains. He trained under Mr. Schultz and other leaders for months before officially taking over the top spot.</p><p>It was up to Mr. Narasimhan to execute on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/13/business/starbucks-reinvention-strategy-employees.html" title="">“reinvention”</a> strategy that Mr. Schultz had created highlighting increased use of automation and aggressive growth of stores in markets like China.</p><p>In recent quarters, as the company struggled with operations and slowing sales in China and the United States, Mr. Schultz, who does not hold a role at the company or on its board, was quick to criticize the company’s performance and leadership.</p><p>“Over the past five days, I have been asked by people inside and outside the company for my thoughts on what should be done,” Mr. Schultz wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/howardschultz_starbucks-announced-earnings-last-week-and-activity-7193044402255110144-y4mN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> post three months ago. “I have emphasized that the company’s fix needs to begin at home: U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company’s fall from grace.”</p></div></div><div><p>“Senior leaders — including board members — need to spend more time with those who wear the green apron,” he continued.</p></div><div><div><p>Mr. Niccol has emerged in recent years as one of the top restaurant leaders in the industry. After spending about three years at the top of Taco Bell, part of Yum! Brands, Mr. Niccol took over as chief executive of Chipotle in early 2018. He shifted much of the brand’s growth toward drive-through restaurants and elevated its loyalty program. Chipotle’s stock has soared from around $6 in 2018 to a recent record high of more than $65 this summer.</p><p>On Tuesday, Chipotle’s stock fell nearly 12 percent as the company said its chief operating officer, Scott Boatwright, would act as interim C.E.O.</p><p>Still, Starbucks, with more than $36 billion in annual revenues and 38,000 stores across more than 80 countries, towers over Chipotle’s $10 billion in annual revenues and 3,500 restaurants — a business that is largely in the United States.</p></div></div><div><div><p>One of the big questions facing Mr. Niccol when he officially joins the company next month is what aspects of the Starbucks plan he will keep or change, particularly with regard to China. Some analysts have suggested Starbucks should either slow down its growth there as the economy struggles or spin the market off entirely into a separately traded entity.</p><p>And while Wall Street analysts and investors cheered on the news of Mr. Niccol taking the top job at Starbucks, many cautioned that Starbucks’ troubles run deep.</p><p>Mr. Niccol is “inheriting a more challenged and complex organization in Starbucks,” Sharon Zackfia, an analyst at the investment bank William Blair, wrote in a note on Tuesday morning. “We suspect the path to recapturing lost sales will be less linear than it was at Chipotle.”</p><p>Starbucks has also faced mounting pressure from union officials and activists who accuse the company of illegally retaliating against workers and resisting contract negotiations, in the midst of a nationwide union campaign.</p><p>Workers United, part of the Service Employees International Union, represents workers at more than 400 of Starbucks’ roughly 10,000 company-owned stores in the United States.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Under Mr. Schultz — who characterized union organizers as outside forces and urged employees not to be “distracted” by them — the company largely resisted engaging with the union. By contrast, Mr. Narasimhan appeared to have taken a more pragmatic approach. The company began bargaining a framework for a labor contract with union stores this year and had said that it hoped to wrap up the bargaining process with individual stores by the end of the year. In a statement, Workers United said it planned to continue to “work with Starbucks” to “reach fair collective bargaining agreements in the coming months.”</p><p>Mr. Schultz said in a statement that Mr. Niccol is “the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history.”</p><p>Noam Scheiber<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div><div><p>Julie Creswell is a business reporter covering the food industry for The Times, writing about all aspects of food, including farming, food inflation, supply-chain disruptions and climate change.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-creswell">More about Julie Creswell</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Online Hate to Real-World Violence: </strong>Social media posts assailing immigrants have fomented a climate of fear and hatred in Britain, Portugal and other countries. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/09/technology/migrants-racism-social-media-violence.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">The vitriol is now spilling onto the streets</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bari Weiss Knows What She’s Doing: </strong>The founder of The Free Press has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">built a new media empire</a> by persuading audiences that she is a teller of dangerous truths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviving Downtown San Francisco: </strong>The city, which is among those most devastated in the United States after the pandemic, is trying to lure businesses back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/san-francisco-storefronts-free-rent.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">free rent for up to six months</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Not Get Scammed: </strong>Online schemes get more sophisticated all the time. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-scams-advice.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-business-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">Here’s how to protect yourself and what to do if you get duped</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skirting A.I.
