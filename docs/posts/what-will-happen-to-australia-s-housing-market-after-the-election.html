Decades later, he owns four investment properties, which he hopes will be his safety net when he retires.</p><p>“I just see it as a really, really safe bet,” said Mr. Neil, 53.</p><p>He has been on the money. Australia is now one of the most expensive places in the world to own a home.</p><p>But the sky-high values have priced many people out of the housing market and caused an affordability crisis, particularly for younger Australians. They have been exasperated by statistics like the one that shows the typical Australian home costs about <a href="https://grattan.edu.au/news/housing-is-less-affordable-than-ever/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eight times the median income</a> — making it a more expensive real estate market than New York’s. These citizens have a chance to demand change on Saturday, when Australians head to the voting booth.</p><p>For the first time here, millennials and Gen Z voters will outnumber baby boomers in a federal election. But it is unclear to what extent this demographic change will sway results. Recent polls indicate Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is likely to win re-election. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, whose campaign took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/australia/peter-dutton-australia-election-trump.html" title="">cues from President Trump</a>, has seen his support fall as Mr. Trump’s policies have unleashed global tumult.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>As far as the property market goes, there is little will for large-scale change. <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-welfare/home-ownership-and-housing-tenure" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Two-thirds of Australians are homeowners</a>, and about <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/housing/housing-occupancy-and-costs/2019-20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20 percent of the population owns more than one property</a>, according to government statistics. That makes them a powerful voting bloc that is generally opposed to changes that could damage property values. Indeed, the policy proposals from the two major political parties, many economists say, are likely to drive prices even higher.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Perth, Australia. Many young people in the country feel priced out of the housing market.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saeed Khan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some young voters are all too aware of this. “All I can see is house prices going up and even more up,” said Lamisa Islam, 24, who lives with her parents in a southwestern suburb of Sydney while she saves up for her own place. “My little piggy bank will again fall far, far behind.”</p><p>Saul Eslake, an independent economist, distilled the country’s approach to real estate, saying “In Australia, housing has become seen as a vehicle for accumulating paper wealth rather than something which satisfies a basic human need.”</p><p>There are other factors beyond property investors, of course. The biggest problem, many say, is a dire lack of housing supply, which has been made worse by a range of issues like complex zoning and planning laws, a recent shortage of labor and building materials, existing homeowners resistant to new construction in their neighborhoods, and a shortage of viable land in a country where most of the population is crowded into a small number of cities. A decades-long <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-19/australia-s-population-reaches-27-million/104370682" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">population boom</a>, fueled by immigration, has also increased demand for housing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On the campaign trail, both Mr. Albanese, of the Labor Party, and Mr. Dutton have vowed not to change tax laws that many economists say have fueled speculation in real estate.</p><p>One of these is a tax law called <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/review/tax-white-paper/negative-gearing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">negative gearing</a>, which allows those investing in property to claim losses associated with it, including interest expenses, as deductions. Another concession for real estate investors: They receive a discount on the capital gains tax charged on the sale of a home. Although other countries, including the United States, offer similar tax breaks, economists say the ones in Australia are unusually generous.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Construction in Sydney in April.

But at the centerpiece of their election platforms are proposals that will help first-time home buyers.</p><p>Mr. Albanese, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, has pledged to expand a program to allow new buyers to purchase a home with as little as 5 percent down. Mr. Dutton, who is the head of a conservative coalition, has promised to allow first-time buyers of newly built homes to claim tax deductions on their mortgage interest repayments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>These policies are “only going to increase demand, which will push up prices,” said Steven Rowley, a property professor at Curtin University in Western Australia.</p><p>Jerath Head, 37, a renter in Melbourne, said that he found both major parties’ housing affordability policies lackluster. Still, he said, he might vote for Labor over a minor party or an independent, if only to ensure that Mr. Dutton’s Liberal Party did not take power.</p><p>For Mr. Head, who worked as a writer and editor but recently made a midlife career change and returned to school to study medicine, homeownership feels completely out of reach.</p><p>“It’s so far beyond where I think I’m at, at this point in my life, that it’s not even something that registers,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Anniversary of the Vietnam War: </strong>Photography from Vietnam changed how the world saw the war, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/vietnam-war-photography-impact.html">how Americans saw their own country</a> and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago.
