Morena leaders who pushed the overhaul into effect argue it will help root out corrupt officials, democratize the judiciary and begin to repair a justice system that most Mexicans see as unresponsive and broken.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But opposition figures and legal experts criticized the plan, saying it discarded the career requirements of the old system and kept the door open for criminal groups to influence judges.</p><p>Critics also argued that the reform <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/americas/mexico-election-morena-democracy.html" title="">could give Morena control over the judiciary</a>, undermining the system of checks and balances.</p><p>Although the election officials announced preliminary Supreme Court results on Tuesday, most of the votes for Mexico’s judicial election were not yet counted. More than 7,700 candidates were competing for more than 2,600 positions at federal and local levels on Sunday, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/americas/mexico-judicial-election-low-turnout.html" title="">only about 13 percent of voters turned out</a>, the electoral agency said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the National Electoral Institute after polling stations closed in judicial elections on Sunday in Mexico City.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carl De Souza/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>At least eight of the expected Supreme Court justices have publicly associated themselves with Morena, are current or former government officials in Morena administrations, or have worked closely with Morena members.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The candidate for the Supreme Court who received the most votes was Hugo Aguilar Ortiz, a lawyer of Indigenous Mixtec descent. He was among the candidates with a history of working with Morena, having helped coordinate the government’s public consultation process for several flagship projects of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s recent president and a Morena founder.</p><p>Another leading candidate, María Estela Ríos, called herself “AMLO’s lawyer” during her campaign, referring to Mr. López Obrador, who first pushed the idea to have judges elected by popular vote. Three other justices were incumbent judges appointed by Mr. López Obrador; one of them ran her campaign saying she was a proud founder of Morena.</p><p>Critics said the results appeared to signal that the possible erosion of the courts’ independence, one of their main fears surrounding the election, might be on course.</p><p>“This signifies the capture of the Supreme Court by a political party,” said Azul Aguiar Aguilar, a researcher on democracy and judicial politics at ITESO, the Jesuit University of Guadalajara. “We’re going to see an alignment of the interests of this court with that political party.”</p><p>The election overhaul was spearheaded by Mr. López Obrador as one of the last major acts of his term. His successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has followed through with enacting the plan since she took office last year, bolstered by Morena’s dominance in Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Sheinbaum rejected claims that the new Supreme Court justices might be more vulnerable to political influence.</p><p>“Their task is to impart justice, regardless of their political orientation,” she told reporters, vowing that she would respect the autonomy of the Supreme Court. “Their task is not to act politically.”</p><p>Ms. Sheinbaum also dismissed concerns about the distribution of the so-called cheat sheets by her party ahead of Election Day. In the run-up to the vote, electoral officials had warned that any effort to coerce or influence voters would be considered illegal interference, and have since <a href="https://www.milenio.com/politica/elecciones/ine-investiga-mc-morena-acordeones-eleccion-judicial" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that at least two political parties, including Morena, are already being investigated for it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has followed through with enacting the election overhaul spearheaded by her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a Morena founder.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luis Antonio Rojas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the days after the election, monitoring groups were divided over how the vote had proceeded.</p><p>“The mission did not encounter the use of cheat sheets during its visit; we were not able to verify an intentional, massive distribution of this resource,” Katia Uriona, the chief of an international mission of election experts who observed the election, <a href="https://centralelectoral.ine.mx/2025/06/02/version-estenografica-de-la-conferencia-de-prensa-que-ofrecieron-las-misiones-de-acompanamiento-internacional-con-las-personas-expertas-electorales/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a news conference on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But other volunteer groups reported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/americas/mexico-judicial-election-low-turnout.html" title="">observing voters holding printed sheets</a> that instructed them which candidates to select. They also said they had witnessed multiple people entering voting booths at once and voters taking photos of their filled ballots, which they called possibly illegal activity.</p><p>After casting her vote on Sunday, Félix Díaz Mendoza, a 65-year-old domestic worker in Tultitlán, a town in Mexico State, said Morena members visited her home last week to share the party’s preferred candidates.</p><p>She said she had agreed to help, and was happy to support the party, adding that the current government had helped her financially where past administrations had not. </p><p>“We believe in them, we trust them,” she said. “And I am trusting Morena and the president.”</p><p>Morena is widely popular around Mexico, having won two consecutive presidential elections and supermajorities in Congress. Even some Mexicans who sympathize with Morena but felt discomfort with the overhaul decided to vote along party lines on Sunday.</p><p>“I see that there are several important flaws in the movement and in the party,” said Héctor Flores, 37, who works in technology and lives in Mexico City. “At the same time, ethically and politically, I consider it to be the best political alternative.”</p><p>Mr. Flores said that he worried that one party would consolidate power, but not as intensely as other critics of the overhaul did. He added that he had voted for candidates backed by Morena after receiving guidance from his mother, a volunteer Morena activist.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p></div><div><p>James Wagner covers Latin America, including sports, and is based in Mexico City.
