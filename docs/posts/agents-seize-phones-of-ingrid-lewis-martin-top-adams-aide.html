Aidala, said in a statement. “She will cooperate fully with any and all investigations,” he said, adding that Ms. Lewis-Martin was “not the target of any case of which we are aware.”</p><p>Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, referred questions to Ms. Lewis-Martin’s personal attorney.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin was served with the grand jury subpoena and told about the search on Friday when she landed at Kennedy International Airport, having returned from a vacation in Japan, and was met by two sets of investigators, one state and one federal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The actions appear to be tied to two different investigations, though information about the morning’s events and the nature of the state inquiry was preliminary. Several people with knowledge of the matter confirmed that the two sets of investigators approached Ms. Lewis-Martin after she passed through customs, served her with the subpoena and seized her phones.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index-articleLarge-v7.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Tracking Charges and Investigations in Eric Adams’s Orbit</h2><p>Four federal corruption inquiries have reached into the world of Mayor Eric Adams of New York. Here is a closer look at the charges against Mr. Adams and how people with ties to him are related to the inquiries.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The moves came shortly before Mr. Adams was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/nyregion/eric-adams-court-appearance.html" title="">arraigned</a> in federal court in Lower Manhattan on charges of bribery and wire fraud. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/eric-adams-graft-charges.html" title="">indictment</a> from the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York accuses the mayor of soliciting and receiving illegal campaign donations from foreign nationals and accepting bribes in exchange for official acts. Mr. Adams has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin, who is considered the mayor’s second-in-command, has been friends with Mr. Adams for roughly 40 years and has described herself as “his sister ordained by God.” A Christian chaplain, she has been his top aide since 2006, when she managed his successful campaign for a State Senate seat.</p><p>Colleagues describe her as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">the mayor’s political enforcer</a> — she is known by the nickname “the Lioness of City Hall” — a characterization she does not shy away from.</p><p>“I’m not Michelle Obama,” she <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/personality/2022/12/ingrid-lewis-martin-nycs-higher-power/380425/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told City and State</a> in 2022. “When they go low? We drill for oil.”</p><p>When Mr. Adams was elected mayor, several supporters advised him not to bring Ms. Lewis-Martin with him to City Hall, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/18/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-adams.html" title="">reported last year</a>, according to six people with knowledge of the conversations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Lewis-Martin was seen as combative when she worked for Mr. Adams in the Brooklyn borough president’s office and as often pushing ethical boundaries. Others worried that she would have too much power and not enough responsibility.</p><p>The federal subpoena served on Ms. Lewis-Martin seeks information related to the investigation that produced the corruption charges against the mayor, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said. The state investigation apparently grew out of an inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney’s office that led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/nyregion/eric-ulrich-surrender-bribery.html" title="">indictment last year of Eric Ulrich</a>, who had been the mayor’s senior adviser and buildings commissioner, for taking bribes.</p><p>When Mr. Ulrich was still in the administration, he and Ms. Lewis-Martin were considered friends, a former administration official said. Mr. Ulrich was a frequent presence in Ms. Lewis-Martin’s office and when he was indicted, she was upset, the official said.</p><p>Though she is not named in one of the indictments against Mr. Ulrich and three co-defendants, Ms. Lewis-Martin appears to play a small role in it. The charges accuse Mr. Ulrich of using his position to benefit his co-defendants in exchange for bribes.</p><p>The indictment features a person identified only as Mr. Adams’s “chief adviser” meeting and speaking by telephone with the co-defendants as they tried to get City Hall to help with regulatory issues affecting their business interests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The indictment did not accuse the chief adviser of wrongdoing.</p><p>Shortly before noon on Friday, Ms. Lewis-Martin was approached at the airport by the two sets of investigators after her flight had landed, the people said. The investigators from the district attorney’s office, who were accompanied by others from the city’s Department of Investigation both at the airport and during the search of Ms. Lewis-Martin’s Brooklyn home, seized her phones and told her they were simultaneously searching her house, the people said.</p><p>The investigators allowed her to call her lawyer, and she surrendered her phones in response to a warrant. At roughly the same time, the federal investigators served her with the grand jury subpoena, which was issued by one of the prosecutors overseeing the investigation into the mayor, one of the people said.</p><p>Representatives of the U.S. attorney’s office, the district attorney’s office and the Department of Investigation all declined to comment.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, reporters assembled in front of Ms. Lewis-Martin’s small redbrick house, located in East Flatbush.</p><p>Amram Amsalem, 61, a neighbor who said he was “good friends” with Ms. Lewis-Martin and her family, said the search earlier in the day had taken him by surprise.</p><p>“I feel bad, to tell you the truth, I feel bad,” Mr. Amsalem said. “It’s very nice people.”</p><p>Lola Fadulu<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
