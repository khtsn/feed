Encroaching on a densely populated part of metropolitan Los Angeles, the blaze has created a new level of fear in residents used to thinking about wildfires as a concern only for those who live in hilly communities.</p><p>It was less than a mile west of the Hollywood Bowl, which is one of the city’s biggest entertainment venues and is inside the mandatory evacuation zone set up after the Sunset fire broke out. The Dolby Theater, where the Academy Awards are held, the TCL Chinese Theater and the Capital Records building are also in the zone.</p><p>The authorities have ordered mandatory evacuations for a wealthy area bordered by Mulholland Drive and Hollywood Boulevard, names that evoke the grandeur and romance of the movies. Evacuation warnings stretched west into parts of Beverly Hills, home to many Hollywood stars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Hollywood sign is near the evacuation area, as is the Griffith Observatory. The Hollywood Hills can be tricky to navigate, full of the same kind of narrow, twisting roads that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/pacific-palisades-wildfire-evacuations.html" title="">complicated evacuations</a> in Pacific Palisades on Tuesday.</p><p>All staff at the Hollywood Bowl left safely after the venue received evacuation orders, a spokeswoman said. The TCL Chinese Theater <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DElsgrZpuFz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that it had closed for the night and sent employees home.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
