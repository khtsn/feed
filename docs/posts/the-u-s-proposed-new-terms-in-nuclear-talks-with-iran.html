    <h1>The U.S. Proposed New Terms in Nuclear Talks With Iran</h1>

Under the terms of the proposal, Iran would continue to enrich uranium at low levels while the U.S. and other countries work out a more detailed plan to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon.</p><p>The proposal amounts to a bridge between the current situation, in which Iran is rapidly producing near-bomb-grade uranium, and the U.S. goal of Iran enriching no uranium at all on its soil. It is the first concrete indication since Trump took office that the U.S. and Iran might be able to find a compromise. Officials in Tehran indicated that a response would come in several days.</p><p>A breakthrough would be an unexpected twist in the president’s diplomatic approach: After pulling out of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, he ordered the killing of Iran’s highest-ranking generals. Iran, in return, has been accused of hiring assassins to kill Trump during his 2024 campaign.</p><p>However, some details of a potential future deal remain vague, and the two sides are far apart on many issues. Just yesterday, Trump said he would “not allow any enrichment of uranium” in Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian volunteers collecting the remains of Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2f48a223">Troop casualties in Ukraine near 1.4 million, a study found</h2><p>Nearly 1 million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the war in Ukraine, according to a new study. Roughly 400,000 Ukrainian troops were also estimated to have been killed or wounded, bringing the total casualties of the three-year assault to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-troop-casualties.html" title="">a staggering 1.4 million</a>.</p><p>The group that conducted the study, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cautioned that casualty figures were difficult to estimate. But the tally still reflects the grinding nature of the conflict. Russia’s territorial gains, the study said, have hovered around 165 feet a day in some places, slower than the bogged-down and costly Somme advance of World War I.</p><p>The study came on the heels of two ambitious Ukrainian attacks. Today, Kyiv said its troops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crimea-bridge.html" title="">struck the Crimean bridge</a> for the third time, with explosives planted over the course of months. Over the weekend, remotely operated Ukrainian drones emerged from hiding inside Russia and began wreaking damage. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks.html" title="">These videos show the aftermath</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An X-ray of the skull of a patient with multiple myeloma, showing its telltale bone lesions, in dark patches.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Science Photo Library/Science Source</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3912ab4b">A potential cure was found for a deadly blood cancer</h2><p>Multiple myeloma is a painful, devastating disease.

A decade later, it’s still going. At this year’s event, the crowd was peppered with nautical attire, argyle sweater vests and movie-inspired merch.
