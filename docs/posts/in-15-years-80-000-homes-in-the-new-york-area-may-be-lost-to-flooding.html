But little progress has been made on the bay side, which floods regularly.</p><p>Throughout the city, other mitigation measures are underway or already complete, including <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/escr/about/resiliency-and-flood-protection.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flood walls and floodgates</a> on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and nature-based solutions, like <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bluebelts</a>, which connect storm sewers to lakes and ponds.</p><p>After Superstorm Sandy inundated much of Staten Island’s eastern shore in 2012, the state bought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/nyregion/hurricane-sandy-nyc-10-year-anniversary.html" title="">more than 500 damaged homes</a>, clearing most of them to return the land to a natural state in a practice known as managed retreat.

The report said the region needed 362,000 additional homes today, in part to relieve overcrowding and permanently house the shelter population, among other factors.</p><p>In 15 years, that number will more than triple to 1.2 million, when accounting for population growth, flood loss and general housing deterioration. Cities and towns should cluster growth in the parts of the region that have a relatively lower risk of flooding and are near public transit and commercial hubs, the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Warren Schreiber, the president of the Queens Civic Congress, a group of civic associations from across the borough, said he agreed that people needed to be made safe from flood risks. But he said that any new development should focus on affordable housing, which raised the question of how much that development would cost.</p><p>“Who’s going to pay for this?” he said. “Is it going to be on the backs of middle-income working-class families?”</p><p>The report also used a tool called <a href="https://www.zoningatlas.org/atlas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the National Zoning Atlas</a>, which maps local restrictions on development to see where the zoning codes might allow for more homes to be built. The report found that 580,000 homes — less than half of what is needed — could be added under today’s zoning codes (though other factors, like funding or building codes, might also prevent homes from being built).</p><p>That housing gap showed the need for nearly every city, town and village to change their zoning codes to allow for more homes to be built, said Mr. Gates, one of the report’s authors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A garage that flooded after a storm in Mamaroneck, N.Y., in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>New York officials have tried to adapt zoning codes for easier building in recent years, with mixed success.</p><p>Gov.
