At the same time, the metropolitan area is struggling to adapt to increased flooding and other extreme weather caused by global warming.</p><p>“The sooner we decide as a city to invest in resilience measures to help neighborhoods adapt — whether it’s to fortify or to move — the faster we avert leaving an even bigger crisis for the next generation,” said Amy Chester, the managing director of Rebuild by Design, a nonprofit that works to make infrastructure better able to withstand storms and climate change.</p><p>The report did not single out specific neighborhoods as at risk for flooding. But of the 82,000 homes that could be lost by 2040, more than half were projected to be on Long Island, with some Atlantic Ocean-facing towns like Babylon and Islip bearing the brunt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cities along the Long Island Sound on both the island and in Westchester County would also be vulnerable. In New York City, waterfront neighborhoods in southern Queens and Brooklyn, like the Rockaways and Canarsie, would see the most losses.</p><p>Some <a href="https://lmdevpartners.com/projects/arverne-east-phase-1/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new developments on the Rockaway Peninsula</a> in Queens, where about 125,000 people live, are focused on trying to protect against flooding while also providing dense, affordable housing.</p><p>Also in the Rockaways, a new system of <a href="https://www.nan.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/487597/fact-sheet-atlantic-coast-of-new-york-city-east-rockaway-inlet-to-rockaway-inle/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">engineered berms</a>, which look like sand dunes but have stone and steel walls at their cores, will help protect the ocean side of the peninsula. But little progress has been made on the bay side, which floods regularly.</p><p>Throughout the city, other mitigation measures are underway or already complete, including <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/escr/about/resiliency-and-flood-protection.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flood walls and floodgates</a> on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and nature-based solutions, like <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bluebelts</a>, which connect storm sewers to lakes and ponds.</p><p>After Superstorm Sandy inundated much of Staten Island’s eastern shore in 2012, the state bought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/nyregion/hurricane-sandy-nyc-10-year-anniversary.html" title="">more than 500 damaged homes</a>, clearing most of them to return the land to a natural state in a practice known as managed retreat. But a <a href="https://www.nan.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Projects-in-New-York/New-York-New-Jersey-Harbor-Tributaries-Focus-Area-Feasibility-Study/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costly, ambitious plan</a> to protect the entire city from coastal storms has yet to be approved by the federal government and is at least 20 years away from completion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The threats of global warming mean that local officials need to “rethink what a conventional home looks like,” said Max Besbris, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specializes in housing and climate change.</p><p>“That means denser housing, more energy-efficient housing, and that probably means giving up on that suburban ideal of a stand-alone home with a white picket fence,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A sea wall goes up near the Franklin D.

The report said the region needed 362,000 additional homes today, in part to relieve overcrowding and permanently house the shelter population, among other factors.</p><p>In 15 years, that number will more than triple to 1.2 million, when accounting for population growth, flood loss and general housing deterioration. Cities and towns should cluster growth in the parts of the region that have a relatively lower risk of flooding and are near public transit and commercial hubs, the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Warren Schreiber, the president of the Queens Civic Congress, a group of civic associations from across the borough, said he agreed that people needed to be made safe from flood risks. But he said that any new development should focus on affordable housing, which raised the question of how much that development would cost.</p><p>“Who’s going to pay for this?” he said. “Is it going to be on the backs of middle-income working-class families?”</p><p>The report also used a tool called <a href="https://www.zoningatlas.org/atlas" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the National Zoning Atlas</a>, which maps local restrictions on development to see where the zoning codes might allow for more homes to be built. The report found that 580,000 homes — less than half of what is needed — could be added under today’s zoning codes (though other factors, like funding or building codes, might also prevent homes from being built).</p><p>That housing gap showed the need for nearly every city, town and village to change their zoning codes to allow for more homes to be built, said Mr. Gates, one of the report’s authors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A garage that flooded after a storm in Mamaroneck, N.Y., in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>New York officials have tried to adapt zoning codes for easier building in recent years, with mixed success.</p><p>Gov.

That plan, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/nyc-housing-city-of-yes.html" title="">the City Council approved</a> in December, would reduce the New York City area’s housing needs by only 11 percent, the report found.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hilary Howard is a Times reporter covering how the New York City region is adapting to climate change and other environmental challenges.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hilary-howard">More about Hilary Howard</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
