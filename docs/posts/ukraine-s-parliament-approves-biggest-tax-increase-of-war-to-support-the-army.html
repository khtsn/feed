It also retroactively doubles taxes on bank profits, to 50 percent for this year, and raises taxes on the profits of other financial institutions to 25 percent, from 18 percent, among other provisions.</p><p>The tax increase approved on Thursday will help to fund a $12 billion military spending increase for this year. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee on finance, tax and customs policy, <a href="https://t.me/yzheleznyak/10238" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called it a “historic tax increase.”</a></p><p>The move is likely to hit hard in Ukraine, where people have already seen their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/world/europe/ukraine-economy-russia.html" title="">economic well-being plummet because of the war</a>. But the authorities argue that they have no choice if Ukraine is to sustain its fight against Russia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/russia-defense-budget-ukraine-war.html" title="">which has ramped up its own military expenditure</a>s. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is expected to ratify the bill in the coming days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Oleksii Movchan, a member of Mr. Zelensky’s party and the deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee on economic development, acknowledged that the bill was “unpopular.”</p><p>“We will be hated, but we don’t have any other option,” he said. “It’s about our survival in this war.”</p><p>While Ukraine receives substantial military aid from its allies in the form of weapons, along with significant financial support for social expenses and reconstruction, it must cover the salaries of its service members and domestic arms production from its own revenues. That military spending accounts for more than half of the state’s $100 billion annual budget, Mr. Movchan said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A supermarket near Pokrovsk, eastern Ukraine, this month.

Ukraine has a flat tax rate of 18 percent on personal income.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Instead, the government tried to raise funds by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/europe/ukraine-privatization-war.html" title="">selling off state assets as part of a privatization push</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/world/europe/ukraine-debt-deal.html" title="">reducing spending on debt</a> after striking a multibillion-dollar restructuring deal with international private creditors.</p><p>But with fighting continuing into a third year, Ukrainian officials warned this summer that raising taxes would become unavoidable.</p><p>“We need to find other ways to keep the macroeconomic situation stable, to help the army and win this war over Russia,” Oleksii Sobolev, Ukraine’s deputy economy minister, said in an interview in June. “Whatever revenue you bring that is generated domestically, through taxes, through businesses — it all goes to the army.”</p><p>The bill is projected to raise an additional $2.8 billion in tax revenues next year, about 14 percent more than in 2024, according to an <a href="https://kse.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Digest_-Draft-Budget-for-2025.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis by the Kyiv School of Economics</a>.</p><p>The analysis was made before Thursday’s vote, and it was unclear whether amendments adopted during the debate, which softened some aspects of the rise, would affect revenue collection.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The urgency to bolster the state budget has only increased in recent months as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/world/europe/ukraine-donbas-strategy-russia-war.html" title="">Ukraine’s troops are steadily losing ground on the battlefield</a> in the east of the country and as military and financial backing to Kyiv is at risk of declining because of war fatigue in the West.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky embarked on a whirlwind tour of European capitals on Thursday to urge foreign allies to increase their support. After meeting with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London in the morning, he traveled to Paris for an afternoon meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France. He is scheduled to visit Rome and Berlin on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, speaking to reporters in Paris after the meeting with Mr. Macron, said the two leaders had discussed ammunition and permission from some of Ukraine’s allies to use certain long-distance weapons. He also said that he had presented Mr. Macron with his so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/europe/zelensky-victory-plan-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">Victory Plan</a>, a strategy aimed at strengthening Ukraine’s position on the battlefield enough to force Russia to the negotiating table.</p><p>His tour comes in the wake of disappointing news for Ukraine — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/world/europe/us-ukraine-biden-ramstein.html" title="">the postponement of a meeting</a> to discuss Ukraine’s war effort after President Biden withdrew because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/08/weather/hurricane-milton-storm-surge.html" title="">a hurricane’s striking Florida</a>. That gathering would have presented Mr. Zelensky a chance to press his plan to end the war with world leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, right, met with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Thursday, part of a tour of European capitals.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tolga Akmen/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But when Mr. Zelensky returns home, he may have to face the wrath of his population over the tax increase — an unpopular measure in any nation, but especially so in a country whose economy has been ravaged by the war.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On Thursday, several residents of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, said that they strongly opposed the measure.</p><p>“We’ve all been struggling financially for a long time, and now we’ll lose even more of our salaries and income,” said Lola Kuzmina, 47, who works in a shoe store.</p><p>“Even at my job, I see how prices are rising, and people can’t afford to buy our shoes,” she added. “People are buying much less now.”</p><p>Ms. Kuzmina said that everyone around her — family, friends and colleagues — was discussing the tax increases. “There’s a lot of concern and dissatisfaction,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Anna Paskal, a 44-year-old accountant, disagreed, saying that the tax increase was “not critically high and won’t affect my quality of life.” She said she believed the bill would help the military.</p><p>But both opponents and supporters of the bill expressed a shared fear: that the newly generated revenues might fall prey to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-defense-shakeup.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">Ukraine’s pervasive corruption</a> and ultimately fail to reach the military. Those concerns have intensified recently after a series of arrests of Ukrainian officials <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-officials-exposed-on-alleged-corruption-nearly-6-million-found/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused of hoarding millions of dollars in cash at home</a>.</p><p>“I believe that this money won’t go where it’s supposed to,” said Olha Poliakova, a 46-year-old barista, referring to the tax revenue. She and other Kyiv residents pointed out that many Ukrainian brigades had been relying on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/world/europe/ukraine-war-donations-crowdfunding.html" title="">crowdfunding organized by volunteers</a> to purchase military equipment and clothing because of a lack of funding.</p><p>Those concerns were echoed during the final debate over the bill in Parliament, which stretched through the night into Thursday, with opposition members largely voting against the measure.</p><p>Solomiia Bobrovska, an opposition lawmaker and member of the Parliament’s defense and intelligence committee, said, “There is no trust that the state will properly use the money.”</p><p>“It’s been more than two years of war,” Ms. Bobrovska added. “If the state had used funds properly, we wouldn’t need volunteers to raise money for our army.”</p><p>Oleksandra Mykolyshyn<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aurelien Breeden<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/10/world/europe/ukraine-tax-hike-war.html">13</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Parliament Approves New Tax Hike:</strong> The authorities are resorting to a politically unpopular move as they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/world/europe/ukraine-tax-hike-war.html">scramble to raise funds for the grueling military effort against Russia</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russian Spies in Europe:</strong> The head of MI5, Britain’s domestic security service, said Russian intelligence agents are on a mission “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/world/europe/russian-spies-mi5-uk.html">to generate mayhem on British and European streets</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Dogs Offer Comfort in Ukraine:</strong> Dog ownership has surged over the past two years as people seek companionship. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/europe/ukraine-war-dogs.html">In Kyiv, Yorkies, poodles and bichons frisés now rule the streets</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
