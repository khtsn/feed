At the hearing, Mr. Santos is expected to give a statement acknowledging the crimes he has agreed to plead to.</p><p>Pleading guilty would allow Mr. Santos to avoid a trial on nearly two dozen charges — including wire fraud, money laundering and stealing public funds — for which he was facing as many as 22 years in prison.</p></div></div><div><p>Mr. Santos has repeatedly expressed concern about difficulty selecting an unbiased jury because of his notoriety, which has been fueled by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/nyregion/santos-baruch-volleyball.html" title="">colorful lies</a>, <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/oysterbay/disabled-veteran-george-santos-took-3k-dying-dogs-gofundme" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outrageous schemes</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/arts/television/saturday-night-live-george-santos.html" title="">memorable portrayal</a> on Saturday Night Live.</p></div><div><div><p>The plea offers a final bookend to the tale of a political underdog catapulted to Congress in 2022, who unraveled into a seemingly bottomless <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/nyregion/george-santos-lies-charges.html" title="">series of falsehoods</a>.</p><p>Shortly after his election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/nyregion/george-santos-ny-republicans.html" title="">The New York Times reported</a> that much of Mr. Santos’s biography and campaign finances appeared to have been fabricated. Additional reporting from the Times and other news organizations revealed a bizarre array of lies: from inane claims of playing volleyball in college to fundamental deceptions about his education, résumé and cultural heritage.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Santos was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/nyregion/george-santos-charges.html" title="">charged with 23 felony counts</a> for a number of schemes, including stealing money from donors and lying to the government to cover his tracks. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charges, and could still do so, should he change his mind about the plea.</p><p>Prosecutors on Friday asked Judge Joanna Seybert, who is overseeing the case, to schedule a new pretrial meeting for Monday, just three weeks before his trial was set to begin. Mr. Santos and his lawyer, Joseph Murray, did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Prosecutors painted Mr. Santos’s campaign as so desperate for cash that it turned to lying, cheating and stealing to finance its operations. But they also assert a pattern of self-dealing, which saw Mr. Santos repeatedly using his campaign account as a personal piggy bank.</p><p>Prosecutors said Mr. Santos used stolen credit card information from one donor to take $11,000 for his personal use. He convinced other donors to give money to what he said was a super PAC supporting his campaign. Instead, he used some of the money to buy designer clothing and pay his personal credit card bills.</p><p>Mr. Santos is also accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/nyregion/george-santos-nancy-marks.html" title="">falsifying campaign finance records</a> to include a $500,000 loan to his campaign that never existed in order to qualify for financial and operational support from the national Republican Party. His campaign treasurer, Nancy Marks, previously admitted to having helped Mr. Santos falsify the loan. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/nyregion/santos-accountant-nancy-marks-guilty.html" title="">pleaded guilty</a> to one felony count in October and faces between three and four years in prison.</p><p>Mr. Santos is also charged with unemployment fraud and lying on House financial disclosure documents.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Santos was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/01/nyregion/santos-expulsion-vote-congress.html" title="">expelled from Congress</a>, becoming one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/nyregion/expelled-congress-members-george-santos.html" title="">only six congressmen</a> in the nation’s history to be kicked out of office. More than two thirds of his colleagues in the House voted in favor of expelling him, including more than 100 Republicans.</p></div></div><div><div><p>For a while, Mr. Santos seemed to revel in the attention engendered by his fall from grace. He began selling short, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/us/politics/george-santos-cameo.html" title="">personalized video messages on the video app Cameo</a>, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. He also began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/nyregion/george-santos-documentary-fyre.html" title="">filming a documentary</a>. More recently, he announced that he had joined OnlyFans, a paid video streaming platform best known for its adult content.</p><p>All the while Mr. Santos dismissed the criminal case against him as a “witch hunt,” echoing former President Donald J. Trump, another former Republican lawmaker with legal troubles of his own.</p><p>But in the past week, Mr. Santos, whose <a href="https://twitter.com/mrsantosny" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bio on X</a> now describes him as an “Opinion writer at large,” signaled that he may be ready to change his tune.</p><p>Amid posts about a fragrance line and the newest Alien movie, Mr. Santos seemed to suggest that he would be stepping back from public life, writing “I’m done” with an emoji of a peace sign.</p><p>That same day he quoted the poet Maya Angelou, saying: “It may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from.”</p><p>Michael Gold<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Tragedy in the Hamptons: </strong>Candice and Brandon Miller projected an Instagram-perfect life. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/nyregion/brandon-miller-suicide-debt.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">But the money to sustain it did not exist.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Brooklyn’s Great Goldfish Heist: </strong>In Bedford-Stuyvesant, an animal lover thought she was doing the right thing by freeing fish from a sidewalk pit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/goldfish-sidewalk-pond-brooklyn.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">But was it a rescue or a robbery</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Zombie Pharmacies: </strong>Over a million square feet of prime real estate is collecting dust across New York City. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/pharmacies-vacant-drugstores-retail.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">It could stay that way for years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Street Wars: </strong>New York City bus stops without trees or shelter are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/nyregion/street-wars-hot-bus-stops.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">leaving riders sweating</a> as they wait — and wait — for buses that a transportation group says do not come fast enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine: </strong>Kai Avent-deLeon, who owns a lifestyle store and a restaurant in Brooklyn, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/nyregion/kai-avent-delon-brooklyn-che-sincerely-tommy.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-metro-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">starts and ends her Sundays with her journal</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></article></div>
