DeGioia, flagged 80 students to be added to a special admissions list — but not, apparently, for their academic or athletic prowess, documents in a lawsuit claim.</p><p>Those on Dr. DeGioia’s president’s list were virtually assured of admissions simply because of their family’s wealth and donation potential, according to a motion filed on Monday in a long-running lawsuit against a set of 17 selective universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Notre Dame, Cornell, Johns Hopkins and Caltech.</p><p>The new motion argues that the universities were supposed to be “need blind” and not take into account a family’s income when they decided who to admit and how much financial aid to offer. The plaintiffs argue that the schools gave preference to wealthy students in a way that violated provisions of a now-expired law permitting them to agree on financial aid formulas.</p><p>Defendants argued that considering student wealth in admissions was not a violation of the law, which required instead that universities would not discriminate against poorer students because they needed financial aid, and that the plaintiffs are attempting to redefine it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At M.I.T., two children recommended by a wealthy banker with ties to a university board member got special treatment, according to the documents. In a deposition, the school’s director of admissions said the two children, who appeared on a “cases of interest” list, were among those who “we would really have not otherwise admitted.”</p><p>At the University of Pennsylvania, some students designated “B.S.I.,” or bona fide special interest, had a dramatically higher rate of admission than other applicants, according to expert testimony filed in the lawsuit.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
