Homes reduced to rubble, walls pockmarked by bullet holes, roads ripped apart by bulldozers. Neighborhood after neighborhood was deserted.</p><p>But this was not Gaza, a territory devastated by the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas, where tens of thousands have been killed and hunger stalks the population. It was the occupied West Bank, another Palestinian territory where the Israeli military has been tightening control in the most sweeping crackdown on militancy there in a generation.</p><p>The contours of the new offensive were unfolding during a recent visit by New York Times reporters to the city of Jenin, among the once densely populated neighborhoods that have been cleared out since an operation began in January. In one of those areas, more than 10,000 people lived until recently. Now, it is empty — its roads blocked by mounds of dirt and flanked by piles of rubble.</p><p>This week, the Israeli military said it would be demolishing homes in Tulkarm, a city near Jenin, to make crowded neighborhoods and streets more accessible to Israeli forces and to prevent the re-emergence of militants. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They’re taking away my future,” Muath Amarne, a 23-year-old university student, said on Wednesday, the day he learned that his home in Tulkarm would be destroyed.</p><p>Israel conducted frequent military operations in this area in recent years, but its forces almost always left within hours or days. Since January, however, its military has maintained its longest-running presence in the heart of West Bank cities in decades.</p><p>The campaign has targeted Hamas and another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad. In recent weeks, however, clashes have become rare, in a sign that Israel and the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank have arrested or killed many of the militants.</p><p>The two cities most affected, Jenin and Tulkarm, have long been controlled by the Palestinian Authority, the semiautonomous body that cooperates with Israel on security and which many Palestinians hoped would evolve into the government of a future state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A roundabout in a city with low buildings around, some vehicles and a few people." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz/00int-westbank-israel-03-tkpz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/f8133cfc-515f-545c-a00f-4d1e4a3ecf1e" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The city of Jenin in the northern West Bank had long been a bastion of Palestinian militancy.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed houses in the Jenin camp, seen from an Israeli military vehicle. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Israel’s extended presence in these West Bank cities is undermining the powers of the Palestinian Authority.

Around that time, the government added a new objective to its war goals: delivering a blow to West Bank militants.</p><p>Days later, armored vehicles backed by helicopters streamed into the Jenin camp.</p><p>Israel said it has killed more than 100 militants and arrested hundreds since the operation began. It has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/world/middleeast/west-bank-palestinian-displacement.html" title="">displaced roughly 40,000 Palestinians</a> — more than any other military campaign in the West Bank since Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Middle East war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That has summoned fears among some Palestinians of a second nakba — the Arabic word for disaster that is used to describe the mass flight and expulsion of Palestinians during the war surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948.</p><p>“I’m afraid I won’t be able to go home like in 1948,” said Saleema al-Saadi, 83, a resident of the Jenin camp who said she had been displaced once before nearly eight decades ago.</p><p>In late February, Defense Minister Israel Katz told Israeli forces to prepare to remain in Jenin and Tulkarm for the next year.</p><p>If that happens, it would be a major change in the way West Bank cities have been governed since the creation of the Palestinian Authority in the 1990s.
