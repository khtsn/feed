Gov. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/desantis-gulf-of-america-executive-order-trump.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Ron DeSantis of Florida has already started using the name</a> “Gulf of America,” putting it in a winter weather warning that an area of low pressure was moving “across the Gulf of America” toward Florida.</p><p>Other countries don’t have to follow suit, though. When President Trump first announced his plan for the name changes, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico responded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/mexico-president-mexican-america-trump.html" title="">suggesting America should be renamed América Mexicana</a>, or Mexican America.</p><p>“The Gulf of America, formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico, is one of the most vital assets in the Nation’s history and economy,” the Interior Department said in a statement on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The agency on Friday also said the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a federal body that oversees standardized geographic names, is working “expeditiously” to fulfill Mr. Trump’s order to restore the name of the former president, William McKinley, to the Alaska peak.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/mount-mckinley-will-be-renamed-denali.html" title="">Obama administration in 2015 officially named the mountain Denali</a> after decades of advocacy by Alaska Native groups as well as lawmakers from both major parties. On Friday, the Trump administration called that Obama-era decision “an affront” to Mr. McKinley.</p><p>Mr. McKinley, who was from Ohio, had no known connection to Alaska and never visited the mountain. The peak was named for him by a gold prospector and was popularized after he became president and was assassinated.</p><p>Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, both Republicans, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/denali-mckinley-alaska-trump.html" title="">objected to Mr. Trump’s renaming efforts</a>. They said they felt that Denali was the rightful name of the awe-inspiring white peaks located 20,310 feet above sea level in the home of the Koyukon people and other Alaska Native groups.</p><p>Any proponent of a name change is required by law to make the case before the geographic names board, which is made up of representatives of various government agencies.
