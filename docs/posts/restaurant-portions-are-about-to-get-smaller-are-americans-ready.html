But the relationship has shifted significantly. More than 75 percent of customers say they want smaller portions for less money, according to the 2024 National Restaurant Association <a href="https://restaurant.org/research-and-media/media/press-releases/restaurant-industry-sales-forecast-to-set-1-1-trillion-record-in-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report on the industry</a>.</p><p>Restaurants sinking under rising food costs are trying to figure out how to sell smaller servings without upsetting value-minded customers. This month, the <a href="https://msb.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/POWER-OF-PORTIONSdigital-1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Portion Balance Coalition</a>, based at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, began a yearlong study to puzzle out the problem. They hope to sign on at least 10 high-volume chains like Panda Express and Chick-fil-A.</p><p>Some restaurants have already taken action. In January, Subway introduced <a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/subway-sidekicks-footlong-auntie-annes-pretzels-cinnabon-churros-cookie/704873/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a> <a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/subway-sidekicks-footlong-auntie-annes-pretzels-cinnabon-churros-cookie/704873/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snack-focused menu</a> that includes smaller bites like $3 hot wraps. Burger King’s largest franchisee shrank <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/business/burger-king-nuggets-meal-reduction/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its 10-piece chicken nugget order</a> to eight.

As much as 40 percent of food served at restaurants never gets eaten, according to <a href="https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1371&amp;context=ijamt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2020 study</a> on food waste. In an effort to slow climate change, states including California and Massachusetts <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5112435/food-waste-bans-climate-change-study" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have restricted</a> how much food can end up in landfills. And millions of people taking GLP-1 drugs are eating much less than they once did.</p><p>Then there’s what market researchers call <a href="https://www.euromonitor.com/article/snackification-can-only-grow-in-one-way-healthy#:~:text=Snackification%20describes%20the%20phenomenon%20of,their%20launches%20of%20snacking%20formats." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“snackification.”</a> Especially among younger people, traditional meals are being replaced with snacks and small assemblages of food that approximate meals. Millennials and Gen Z-ers in particular are snacking more as a way to manage schedules that vary widely day to day, to explore bolder flavors in a low-risk way and to create more nutritionally sound diets.</p><p>On average, U.S. adults describe half the occasions they eat in a day as snacks, according to data from <a href="https://www.hartman-group.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Hartman Group,</a> a market research company.</p><p>For younger diners, value is a much more complex calculus than getting the largest portion for the lowest price, said Shelley Balanko, the group’s senior vice president. They care about whether a price is fair given the quality of the ingredients and cost of labor, and how much their food impacts the environment.</p><p>“When it comes to quantity,” she said, “it’s the right size for me or for my needs at the moment.”</p><p>Customizing portion sizes should be as easy as it is for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/dining/drinks/customized-drinks.html" title="">a morning coffee</a> or a lunchtime salad, said Dana Gunders, the president of <a href="https://refed.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ReFED</a>, the nation’s leading organization fighting food waste and one of the groups working on the Georgetown portion study.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>She’d like to see restaurants offer half-bowl options or baby burritos. “I can customize everything about my order except the size,” she said. “People want this choice and they are not getting it.”</p><p>Many diners <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60b79a2f98654d062e0792d6/t/63c0647e3c391510f9e0cf6c/1673553025358/NMI+Portions+Attitude+%26+Behavior+Research_rev+web.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already navigate</a> their way around big portions by ordering kids’ meals, sticking to appetizers or embracing restaurants that offer shareable small plates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Meal bundling, with portions than can serve a group of people, became popular during the pandemic.

At <a href="https://www.olivegarden.com/menu/family-style-meals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olive Garden,</a> for example, a lasagna bundle with salad and breadsticks designed to serve four to six people costs about $59. Diners can stretch the food into several meals, or feed more people than the menu suggests.</p><p>When Abby Fammartino eats out with her husband and son, they control how much they get by under-ordering. “We may only order two things to share because we know that the portion sizes are high,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As the director of health and sustainability programs and research at the Culinary Institute of America, Ms. Fammartino is coordinating the yearlong experiment with ReFED and the <a href="https://qz.com/1691559/a-nutrition-group-sees-portion-control-as-the-next-diet-movement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Portion Balance Coalition,</a> an organization that began in 2017 and collaborates with food manufacturers, restaurant chains, researchers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><p>Among the questions they’re asking: How can restaurants shift diners’ perspectives on appropriate portion sizes? Would it help to change menu descriptions, use smaller plates or add images to show the size of each dish? How about serving fewer French fries but allowing diners to order more for free. Many diners wouldn’t, but it might feel like a good deal — and help the restaurant avoid throwing away uneaten food.</p><p>Part of the problem, researchers say, is that most people have no idea what a reasonable amount of food looks like because they have “portion distortion.”</p><p>“Once you get used to larger portions, anything that looks like a normal-sized portion seems like you are getting cheated,” said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447051/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has researched</a> the link between portion size and obesity. “I think it’s very hard to go back. It feels awful to people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor at New York University, has done extensive research on the health impact of large portion sizes.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bill Hayes</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In <a href="https://nclnet.org/standardizing-portions-stem-obesity-epidemic/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2023 experiment</a> with three independent restaurants in Southern California<a href="https://nclnet.org/standardizing-portions-stem-obesity-epidemic/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">,</a> Kaiser Permanente helped create a “balanced portions” menu that featured portion sizes that nutritionists would consider reasonable. Restaurant dinner portions average about 900 to 1,500 calories, and the balanced-portion dinners are not more than 700 calories. That might include three ounces of chicken, three-quarters of a cup of rice and a couple of cups of vegetables.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The approach proved so popular that two restaurants decided to keep it. One that didn’t want to change its larger portions marketed them as “dinner today, lunch tomorrow.” Two new restaurants have since joined the study.</p><p>“What I like about the balanced-portion menu is that I do not have to do any mental work in ordering,” one participant told the researchers. “You’ve done all of the homework.”</p><p>Deborah Cohen, the author and <a href="https://www.kp-scalresearch.org/investigator/deborah-a-cohen-md-mph/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research scientist</a> who led the study, likens the battle to shrink portions to the public health campaign to get people to stop smoking, which took years. That required limiting access to cigarettes and underscoring how addictive smoking is.</p><p>Most people lack the ability to control how much they eat when they are served too much, Dr. Cohen said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“We have to go in that direction of changing the environment, not just letting people go at it on their own,” she said. “They are not likely to succeed if everything is stacked against them. It’s like trying to swim in the tsunami.”</p><p>But many customers like portion sizes the way they are, said Kevin Hochman, chief executive officer and president of Brinker International, which owns <a href="https://www.chilis.com/locations?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwl6-3BhBWEiwApN6_krvYSnfNRx-Vhvvq9qrzTxEbIWv05ih9kMPmnj1iWXghG4qdZrD8SRoCVVQQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chili’s Grill &amp; Bar</a> and <a href="https://www.maggianos.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maggiano’s Little Italy,</a> a chain he said was built on the concept that “Grandma always wanted you to leave overly stuffed and feeling like you can’t eat any more.”</p><p>For every guest who wants the chance to customize a meal, he said, there’s another who doesn’t want to do all that work. For every diner seeking smaller portions, there’s one who wants to splurge on a hearty meal, or get the most for their money.</p><p>“There is a truth about American consumers: People want what they want,” he said. “It’s our job to meet guests where they are and not where we think they should be.”</p><p>Chipotle Mexican Grill recently learned that portion sizes matter a lot to its customers, and not because they want smaller ones. Reviewing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/keith_lee125/reel/C7Dm9nTOzib/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Chipotle in May,</a> the online food influencer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/dining/keith-lee-food-critic.html" title="">Keith Lee</a> complained that there wasn’t enough chicken in his bowl.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>His fans sprang into action, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wowdrew/video/7371911882577333547?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recording workers</a> as they assembled their bowls, and walking out if the servings seemed small. When the company’s chief executive, Brian Niccol, posted <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fortune/video/7374898437222862126?q=Chipotle%20portions&amp;t=1725931184967" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video</a> saying big portions were part of the chain’s ethos, he was <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fortune/video/7375243751783992619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">widely mocked</a>. He eventually relented and told investors in a call that at least 10 percent of his restaurants were serving portions that were too small.</p><p>Jack Goldburg, the popular globe-trotting restaurant influencer behind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxH12tSiXAE8d5qB0vOT7yA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jack’s Dining Room,</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jacksdiningroom/video/7368585190991645998" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joined the thousands</a> of Chipotle critics. He’s a fan of the restaurants, but he remembers when he could spend $14 or so there and get a feast.</p><p><strong>“</strong>No one thinks they’re going to walk into Chipotle or Sweetgreen and think, ‘Yeah, this is going to be the best meal I’ve ever had in my life,’” he said. “What you think is, ‘I’m going to spend $15 to $20 and I’m going to get the best bang for my buck.’ But now you’re like, ‘Maybe I could just go cook the same thing and get way more food for a lot less money.’”</p><p>Like others, he believes that the era of giant plates of food are over, and that quality matters more than ever.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>D</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Restaurants Are Preparing to Take Diners Down a Size<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Our reporters and editors traveled to nearly every state for our annual list of America’s best restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-restaurants-america.html">These are our 50 favorite places for 2024</a>.</p></li><li><p>We launched New York Times Cooking 10 years ago.
