</span>, in the tournament.</p>

<p>This series is the sixth time both teams have played against each other, with Paper Rex coming out on top in four of their five previous series. Additionally, both teams had placed in the top eight at every international event since LOCK//IN. </p>

<p>The map veto began with Bind and Haven off the table. EDward Gaming picked Icebox, while Paper Rex took the series to Sunset. Ascent and Abyss were banned next, leaving Lotus as the decider series. Including all of Stage 2 and previous Champions matches, the two teams had nearly identical map pools, meaning the veto did not necessarily favor either team. With both teams at a 50% win rate on Icebox, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/624/paper-rex/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2024-06-10&amp;date_end=2024-08-10" target="_blank">Paper Rex&#39;s recent results</a> on the map likely gave EDG confidence in the pick, while PRX&#39;s own 6-0 record on Sunset left it as a no-brainer for them despite <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/1120/edward-gaming/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2024-06-10&amp;date_end=2024-08-10" target="_blank">EDG&#39;s similar 3-0 streak</a>.</p>

<p>“We want to present a beautiful match to all viewers,” <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> said prior to the series. “We&#39;re always friendly, as long as KangKang doesn&#39;t [pose against us],” <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span> added. “If he does, <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17086/something">
		something	</a>
</span> will do it too.”</p>

<p>The match began on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378677/edward-gaming-vs-paper-rex-valorant-champions-2024-decider-d/?game=180411&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Icebox</a>, with an aggressive push into B backsite and a something 4K winning the opener. Paper Rex won the following two rounds with few complications, but EDG took their first round in the eco. Another Paper Rex round led to a timeout from the opposing coach, <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29401/muggle">
		Muggle	</a>
</span>. Despite keeping rounds close, PRX continued extending their lead. </p>


<p><em>A scrappy round from both sides was on of few times Paper Rex faltered on Icebox</em></p>

<p>By the end of the half, EDward Gaming had won a couple of rounds, first thanks to a Viper&#39;s Pit and then by punishing a misplaced Sage Barrier. PRX remained in the lead, converting a 3v5 on the pistol and leaving their opponents helpless for the next round and drawing out EDG&#39;s second tactical pause. Two early fights on A followed, which the Southeast Asian team won comfortably to close out map one 13-3.</p>

<p>“They always change their strategy when they play against us,” Muggle said before the second map. “So we&#39;ll just go on our instinct and reaction.”</p>

<p>Moving onto <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378677/edward-gaming-vs-paper-rex-valorant-champions-2024-decider-d/?game=180412&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a>, a rapid counter prevented EDG&#39;s plant, giving Paper Rex the pistol. PRX denied a mid play to win the anti-eco, but the rifle advantage was too strong to overcome in the bonus round. Patience paid off for the top China seed, who were able to string together three rounds and force a Paper Rex timeout. Three questionable rounds followed, but Paper Rex were able to recover and take the lead. EDG took two to hurt the opposition&#39;s economy, but the half ended 6-6 after a successful retake. </p>


<p><em>EDG&#39;s utility helps win the bonus round</em></p>

<p>The second pistol round came down to the wire, as Paper Rex were close to converting a 2v4 after a quick lurk through mid by <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9803/d4v41">
		d4v41	</a>
</span>. EDG narrowed the fight down to a 1v1, which <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13768/s1mon">
		S1Mon	</a>
</span> won. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> were key the next three rounds, as they combined their utility to prevent PRX from gaining any advantage. The duo ended the defensive half with 13 eliminations and over 230 ADR apiece, with a 1.81 and 2.16 rating, respectively. </p>

<p>The attackers finally won a pair of rounds to set the score 11-8, but Smoggy helped damage their economy, leaving Paper Rex with a half buy for the final round. With weakened opponents, EDward Gaming won Sunset 13-8 and tied the series 1-1.</p>

<p>The Chinese roster remained on track to kick off the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/378677/edward-gaming-vs-paper-rex-valorant-champions-2024-decider-d/?game=180413&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">decider map</a>. They punished an early defensive push to win round 1, and eased into A to take the next pair of rounds. A timeout helped Paper Rex get a read on their eco, but their weaponry was too weak to win the round. Their low credits forced them to save a round later, which left <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9804/alecks">
		alecks	</a>
</span> dissatisfied. He burned the team&#39;s second tactical pause, a much needed reset for his squad. </p>

<p>Paper Rex finally showed up on the scoreboard with two comfortable round wins, but <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> and ZmjjKK returned momentum to the attacking team, forcing Paper Rex onto a half buy for round 10. Eventually, an indecisive round from EDG helped PRX win a third round, but the China representatives recovered in their last attack round, baiting out important utility to set the score 9-3 ahead of the break. </p>

<p>nobody and Smoggy continued their dominance in the second half, with CHICHOO cleaning up the crumbs. They found back-to-back quadruple kills to reach 11-4. f0rsakeN found his own multikill to win a consolation round, but it was quickly answered by EDG herding the offense into C, where the duo-of-the-match laid in wait to shut down a late execute. </p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3017/nobody">
		nobody	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> were the highlight of the series, crucial in their recovery the final two maps</em></p>

<p>As if coordinating through match chat, both teams decided to fight EDG&#39;s match point outside of A. Paper Rex were able to draw out defensive utility, in exchange for better positioning for EDG.  A second fight ensued, costing PRX three players but breaking through their first obstacle. nobody&#39;s quick flank was shut down, leaving a 2v1 and A free to plant. Smoggy remained unaccounted for, however, and he used a Meddle on default, leaving the plant weak enough to be sprayed down through the smoke. This ended the map 13-4 and the series  2-1, sending EDG to playoffs.</p>

<p>Following the series, Paper Rex have now been eliminated from Champions 2024. This is the first time they have failed to make it out of a group stage since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1015/valorant-champions-2022/group-stage" target="_blank">Champions 2022</a>, and only the third time they have been unable to reach playoffs since <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/466/valorant-champions-tour-stage-3-masters-berlin/group-stage" target="_blank">their international debut</a>.</p>

<p>“We adjusted quickly on map two and map three,” CHICHOO said after the match. “We&#39;ve played Paper Rex so many times that we were able to fix our mistakes on the last two maps.” </p>

<p>CHICHOO confirmed they were expecting Paper Rex&#39;s comp change to counter EDG&#39;s agent pick on Lotus. “We predicted they would try this comp,” he stated. </p>

<p>Before <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/389508/champions-playoffs-matches-revealed" target="_blank">the draw show</a>, he said he did not want to play against the fellow Chinese squad, <span data-ref-id="15">
