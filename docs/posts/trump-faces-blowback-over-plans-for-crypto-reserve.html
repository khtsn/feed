reserve</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are again riding high, after President Trump announced that he would create a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114093946326587357" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national crypto reserve with five tokens</a>, including three lesser-known and highly volatile ones.</p><p>It’s the latest boost that Trump has given the crypto industry, which spent some $130 million <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/technology/crypto-industry-spending-election.html" title="">backing him and other Republicans</a>. But the news drew criticism from many, including conservatives and even ardent crypto backers, over many concerns: giveaways to an already wealthy community, delegitimizing the digital currency industry and more.</p><p><strong>“I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World,”</strong> Trump declared on his Truth Social network on Sunday in announcing the reserve, which would involve the federal government stockpiling five tokens: two well-established ones (Bitcoin and ether) and three newer and more thinly traded ones (XRP, solana and cardano).</p><p>Proponents say a reserve would help taxpayers benefit from crypto’s price growth. It’s still not clear how such a reserve would work or when it would be introduced, though a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912/all-info" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republican-authored bill in the Senate</a> would direct the government to buy one million Bitcoins — worth about $92.6 billion at today’s prices — over five years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>The plan is music to the ears of many in the crypto industry,</strong> who have already benefited significantly from Trump moves like picking regulators who will go easier on digital currencies. The price of Bitcoin alone has jumped 36 percent since the election in November.</p><p><strong>Critics of all political stripes decried the move. </strong>Some Republicans raised questions about spending taxpayer money on risky assets instead of paying down the national debt. <a href="https://x.com/jtlonsdale/status/1896245689488920748" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joe Lonsdale</a>, a friend of Elon Musk’s, wrote on X: “It’s wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it’s also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes.”</p><p>Some protested the seeming latest conflict of interest involving Trump and crypto, noting that Trump profited from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/politics/trump-meme-coin-crypto.html" title="">promoting the so-called memecoin $Trump</a> before his inauguration. (The S.E.C. last week said memecoins wouldn’t be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/sec-memecoins.html" title="">subject to regulatory oversight</a>.) “This is getting egregious,” the software developer <a href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1896267267123687482" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikita Bier</a> replied to Lonsdale’s post. “Every 2 weeks there is a kickback to the family. Completely delegitimizes all the work DOGE is doing.”</p><p>Others questioned whether David Sacks, the investor who is Trump’s crypto czar, also <a href="https://x.com/dmartkc/status/1896260059640025113" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stands to benefit</a> from such a reserve. Sacks wrote on X that he had <a href="https://x.com/GeorgeNHammond/status/1896390160260153619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold his cryptocurrency holdings</a>, but didn’t address any holdings his investment firm has in crypto start-ups. Sacks will chair a first-of-its kind crypto White House summit on Friday intended to discuss ways to <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/trump-to-host-first-ever-white-house-crypto-summit-in-march-202503030747" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spur innovation and growth</a> in the sector.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>This poses a longer-term question. </strong>Judging by Sunday’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c18e66d-6ab4-45b2-9d86-51909de2db92" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rally in crypto assets</a>, this could vastly benefit crypto investors, who showed that they’re willing to inject huge sums into politics.

That could test E.U. cohesion, analysts say — but might be welcomed by those interested in seeing a divided Europe.</p><p>“Trump, Putin (and possibly Elon Musk?) all seem to dislike the European Union,” Holger Schmieding, an economist at the German bank Berenberg, wrote in a research note this on Monday. “They would prefer to deal one-by-one with a panoply of minnows and middling countries than with a union that represents the second biggest market in the world.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Valuing world-beating companies in revolutionary times is not an easy thing to pinpoint,” Alex Clavel, who oversees SoftBank’s Vision funds, said of investing in artificial intelligence companies.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-4c8c9ef0">A peek inside SoftBank’s Vision Funds</h2><p>In recent years, SoftBank of Japan had sought to make its Vision Fund unit — home to three large financial vehicles that defined a once-heady era of tech investing — more conservative.</p><p>But the desire of Masa Son, SoftBank’s C.E.O., to become a lead investor in the artificial intelligence race is driving the company to spend heavily again, and raises questions about how the Vision Funds fit into that vision.</p><p>The funds’ C.E.O., Alex Clavel, gave DealBook’s Michael de la Merced his first interview since assuming sole leadership of the unit in January about that, and more.</p><p><strong>The new vision:</strong> The funds, which gained notoriety for pouring hundreds of millions into companies like WeWork and the robot-aided-pizza-maker Zume, are now meant to make minority investments in start-ups where someone else is in control, Clavel said. (SoftBank’s $3.5 billion investment in OpenAI is part of Vision Fund 2.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>How the Vision Funds are doing:</strong> The division reported a nearly 310 billion yen ($2 billion) loss in the fourth quarter, as the paper value of holdings like the e-commerce company Coupang fell. But Clavel noted that the division over all grew last year, with its fair value rising by $5 billion and distributing about $66 billion via I.P.O.s and other cash-out events.</p><p><a href="https://visionfund.com/survey/ceos-q4-2022?q=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A survey</a> of the Vision Funds’ hundreds of portfolio companies, whose results were shared first with DealBook, found that many of their C.E.O.s were:</p><ul><li><p>more optimistic about the economy and their businesses’ prospects compared with a year ago — though they’re also feeling more stressed;</p></li><li><p>worried about inflation, high interest rates and ongoing market volatility;</p></li><li><p>and focused on organic growth, but also on conserving cash and stabilizing their companies.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The A.I. factor:</strong> A majority of Vision Fund portfolio company C.E.O.s are using the technology in their core products, a reflection of the overall focus of SoftBank on becoming a leader in the field. “We do see A.I. as a secular trend, a revolution,” Clavel told DealBook.</p><p>That has meant investing in prominent A.I. companies like OpenAI and the data intelligence provider Databricks at increasingly soaring valuations. (The Databricks C.E.O., Ali Ghodsi, told DealBook that “we’re at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/business/dealbook/elon-musk-national-security-risk.html#link-7dd73cb2" title="">peak bubble territory</a> for A.I.”)</p><p>Clavel acknowledged that “valuing world-beating companies in revolutionary times is not an easy thing to pinpoint.” But, he added, paying up big was the cost of entry. “We’re really convinced that this is a revolution,” he added.</p><p><strong>What’s next:</strong> The Vision Funds are betting that it will become easier to take companies public this year, allowing the SoftBank funds to start selling their holdings and locking in gains. “We’re looking forward to the I.P.O. market opening back up,” Clavel said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>One thing not to expect anytime soon, he added, was outside investors returning to the Vision Funds. (While the first Vision Fund counted Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi as investors, the second Vision Fund is all SoftBank money.) “We don’t have any plans to do that,” Clavel said, noting that SoftBank itself has added money to Vision Fund 2 when required.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-607c2df0">The week ahead </h2><p>A major presidential address, jobs, and tariffs — here’s what’s in focus this week.</p><p><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> President Trump will address Congress, outlining his policy agenda.
