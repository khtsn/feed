One of the season’s stalwarts, however, is feeling a little less cozy for some people: Coca-Cola, known for its nostalgia-filled holiday commercials, is facing backlash for creating this year’s ads with generative artificial intelligence.</p><p>The three commercials, which pay tribute to the company’s beloved “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X13N-Bx17Oc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Holidays Are Coming</a>” campaign from 1995, feature cherry-red Coca-Cola trucks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtD4fHgkrqI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">driving</a> through sleepy towns on snowy roads at night. The ads <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RSTupbfGog" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">depict</a> squirrels and rabbits peeking out to watch the passing caravans and a man being handed an ice-cold bottle of cola by Santa Claus.</p><p>“’Tis the season,” a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-J0MwvBSI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jingle</a> chirps, “it’s always the real thing.” The tag line, pushing Coke’s “real thing” slogan, is juxtaposed with a disclaimer: “Created by Real Magic AI.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RSTupbfGog" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The <a href="https://www.today.com/video/coca-cola-slammed-for-using-artificial-intelligence-in-holiday-ad-224736837540" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">internet pile-on</a> arrived swiftly as consumers decried the commercials as uncanny valleyesque perversions of the company’s <a href="https://www.historyoasis.com/post/holidays-are-coming" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">classic</a> ads.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Coca-Cola just put out an ad and ruined Christmas,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dylanpearcee/video/7437993107943066926" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dylan Pearce</a>, one of the campaign’s many critics, said on TikTok, adding, “To put out slop like this just ruins the Christmas spirit.”</p><p>“This is legit heartbreaking,” another user, <a href="https://x.com/LordDexHinton/status/1857642496362189209" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">De’Vion Hinton</a>, posted on X. “Coca Cola has been the gold standard in branding and advertising for decades.”</p><p>Alex Hirsch, an animator and the creator of the Disney series “Gravity Falls,” <a href="https://x.com/_AlexHirsch/status/1857847598054518921" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed</a> a sentiment that other creative professionals have shared online, noting that the brand’s signature red represented the “blood of out-of-work artists.”</p><p>The company, however, is sticking by the ads.</p><p>“The Coca-Cola Company has celebrated a long history of capturing the magic of the holidays in content, film, events and retail activations for decades around the globe,” a spokesman for the company said in a statement provided to The New York Times. “This year, we crafted films through a collaboration of human storytellers and the power of generative A.I.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Coca-Cola will always remain dedicated to creating the highest level of work at the intersection of human creativity and technology,” the statement added.</p><p>Pratik Thakar, a vice president of Coca-Cola and the company’s global head of generative A.I., discussed the project in a recent <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/coca-colas-first-ai-tv-commercials-holidays-christmas/2591886" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with Ad Age, which previewed a screening of one of the spots at its Emerging Tech Summit last week. He cited the budgetary advantages of the project along with the speed at which the work could be created.</p><p>“We keep our roots in our heritage and what Coke is all about as a brand, but then connect the dots with the future and technology,” Mr. Thakar told Ad Age. “And that was kind of a starting point.”</p><p>“A.I. is always good at creating fantastical, hyper-realistic stories, and that’s where the whole imagination went into next level,” he added in <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/coca-colas-ai-holiday-tv-ads-creatives-consumers-react/2592076" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a follow-up story</a> about the consumer reaction. “If I want to go very realistic, maybe it’s difficult, but if I want to go hyper-realistic and fantastical, A.I. is actually a much better tool.”</p><p>Coca-Cola <a href="https://www.silverside.ai/projects/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worked</a> with three A.I. studios to produce the ads: Secret Level, Silverside AI and the Wild Card.</p><p>Coca-Cola is not the first legacy brand to draw backlash for using generative A.I. in its ads. Toys “R” Us received <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/all-ai-ad-from-toys-r-us-inspires-debate-over-the-future-of-marketing-fbecc05b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism</a> in June for a commercial created with OpenAI’s tool Sora that portrayed a boy walking through a toy aisle with wonderment until he was joined by the company’s mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But Coca-Cola, which is a major force in advertising, appears to be pushing headlong into A.I. despite any ruffled feathers.</p><p>Last year, the company <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/09/13/coca-cola-drops-new-drink-created-by-ai-taste-the-future/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released</a> a limited edition drink, Coca-Cola Y3000, that boasted on the can’s label: “Co-Created with AI.”</p><p>“We hope that Coca-Cola will still be as relevant and refreshing in the year 3000 as it is today,” the company said in a statement at the time. “So we challenged ourselves to explore the concept of what a Coke from the future might taste like.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Vadukul is a features writer for the Styles section of The Times, specializing in stories about New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alex-vadukul">More about Alex Vadukul</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Sculpture Turned Necklace: </strong>Sophie Thatcher, the star of “Heretic,” doesn’t always wear <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/style/sophie-thatcher-heretic-necklace.html">the piece made by her twin sister</a>, but keeps it close.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emma Chamberlain’s Next Phase: </strong>The YouTube star, who has a coffee company, a podcast and a new collaboration with Warby Parker, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/style/emma-chamberlain-warby-parker.html">isn’t doing much posting</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dressing America: </strong>Aaron Levine has designed for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Club Monaco and Madewell. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/style/aaron-levine-mens-wear.html">Now, he’s introducing a brand of his own</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A New Face of Girl Power: </strong>The dancehall artist Shenseea’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/style/shenseea-dancehall-music-style.html">seductive songs about the pursuit of female pleasure</a> are making women “feel free.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of Zyn: </strong>The nicotine pouches have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/style/zyn-nicotine-pouch-masculinity.html">a new symbol of American masculinity</a> — and a surprising political lightning rod.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
