A surge in home prices that started a decade ago has been accelerating as vacation rentals, real estate speculation and a shortage of home building have put the goal of affordable housing out of reach for many.</p><p>Nearly 45 million people, or a tenth of European Union residents, spend more than 40 percent of their income on housing. Cities from Barcelona to Berlin are working to combat the problem, which has spread beyond urban areas. Throughout the year, I will be talking to residents, activists, developers and government officials in cities throughout Europe to explore why the crisis is so tough to beat, what solutions are being tested and what people want to see done.</p><p>I’ll read every response to this questionnaire and reach out to you if I’m interested in learning more. I won’t publish any part of your response without contacting you first. And I won’t share your contact information outside The New York Times newsroom or use it for any reason other than to get in touch with you.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about economic, social and policy developments around Europe.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
