That view, demanded by the Trump administration, has increasingly caught on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/13/business/corporate-america-dei-policy-shifts.html" title="">in corporate America</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/trump-dei-executive-orders-schools.html" title="">academia</a>, as well as among <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/politics/democrats-dei-trump.html" title="">some Democrats</a>.</p><p>“I thought he wanted to learn,” said former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, the country’s first Black elected governor and a moderate Democrat who served on Mr. Youngkin’s transition team after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/us/elections/youngkin-wins-virginia-governor.html" title="">his 2021 victory</a>.</p><p>But Mr. Wilder, <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-05-09/doug-wilder-governor-youngkin-martin-brown-dei" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has</a> <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/education/virginia-governor-glenn-youngkin-review-dei-courses-vcu-george-mason/291-b57b5ab7-ca10-4527-86e7-d2f08650361f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since criticized</a> the Youngkin administration’s approach on issues concerning diversity and equity, called him “a disappointment to a lot of people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Certainly, plenty of Americans say they support the notion of diversity, while also thinking that some formal D.E.I. programs, or a Democratic focus on identity more broadly, have gone too far. At some colleges, for instance, D.E.I. programs that began as initiatives to diversify the student body turned into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/education/university-of-michigan-dei.html" title="">vast, lightning-rod bureaucracies</a> that critics said chilled free speech and were overly focused on left-wing ideology.</p><p>In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Youngkin suggested that there was no inconsistency between his support for workplace diversity at Carlyle, and his opposition to D.E.I. programs more broadly now.</p><p>Mr. Youngkin, who <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/22/youngkin-considers-budget-proposal-to-redirect-diversity-office-funds/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">renamed</a> Virginia’s D.E.I. office “the Office of Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion,” suggested that calls for “equity” amount to prescribing “equal outcomes” rooted in identity politics, rather than ensuring access to opportunities. But he still believes that “diversity of thought, diversity of experiences, contribute to that best talent,” he said, and that there must be “pathways for that talent to come work for your organization.”</p><p>“It has been the radicalization of those concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion that have so fundamentally changed,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Virginia and a fan of Mr. Youngkin’s, cautioned against comparing private-sector stances with records in public office, noting that those are “two completely different roles.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But in American politics broadly, he said, “‘diversity,’ ‘inclusion,’ all of that is left-wing vocabulary. That’s not Republican vocabulary.”</p><p>Yet for a time, it was for Mr. Youngkin.</p><h2 id="link-93f3fda">Progress in Diversity Despite ‘a Long Way to Go’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“At Carlyle we believe that diverse teams and experiences bring tremendous value to our firm,” read an S.E.C. filing signed by Mr. Youngkin.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Francis Specker/Alamy Stock Photo</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Youngkin rose through the ranks at Carlyle over 25 years to lead the company during a period of sweeping cultural change.</p><p>He <a href="https://ir.carlyle.com/news-releases/news-release-details/carlyle-group-names-new-executive-leadership-team" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became a co-chief executive in 2018</a>, when many corporations were racing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/business/starbucks-closing-racial-bias-training.html" title="">emphasize</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/business/dealbook/blackrock-laurence-fink-letter.html" title="">their</a> social justice and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html" title="">diversity</a> credentials.

Mr. Lee declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Internally, Mr. Youngkin was not known for throwing around diversity-related buzzwords, but he was seen as promoting the careers of senior women.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“One of the big steps we needed to take was to make diversity and inclusion not a program at Carlyle, but to embed it in the way we think about how to grow,” <a href="https://www.walkerdunlop.com/webcast/willy-walker-conversation-glenn-youngkin-co-ceo-carlyle#:~:text=So%2C%20we%20felt%20that%20one,made%20really%2C%20really%20good%20progress" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a> in a May 2020 webcast, adding that half of the people who had joined Carlyle the previous year were women. “We’ve still got a long way to go, but I think we’ve made really, really good progress. And the key to this is, it’s about diversity of experience and diversity of thought, not box-ticking.”</p><p>During his time as co-chief executive, Carlyle also received a 100 percent rating on the Corporate Equality Index, an assessment from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation focused on workplace policies for L.G.B.T.Q. employees. Criteria that <a href="https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/CEI-2019-FullReport.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carlyle met</a> included “equal health coverage for transgender individuals without exclusion for medically necessary care.”</p><p>That coverage, Mr. Youngkin noted, <a href="https://www.littler.com/news-analysis/asap/understanding-new-york-regulations-regarding-prohibited-discrimination-basis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reflected state-level</a> requirements. But the rating was also plainly a point of pride for his company, which <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/media-room/news-release-archive/carlyle-group-names-kara-helander-chief-diversity-officer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promoted it</a> <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/sites/default/files/2020-06/2020CarlyleImpactReview_20200623.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frequently</a>.</p><p>Asked if he was comfortable with that coverage, Mr. Youngkin said it was management’s job to maintain “an inclusive environment that believed in seeking talent and complied with the law.”</p><p>As governor, however, Mr. Youngkin has rolled <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-transgender-students-schools-youngkin-ba073a1e8a9286456a7509688f40115b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">back some accommodations for L.G.B.T.Q.</a> students and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-order-transgender-athletes-womens-sports.html" title="">attended Mr. Trump’s signing</a> of an executive order aimed at blocking transgender women and girls from competing in women’s sports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p><h2 id="link-727a6843">Standing Against George Floyd’s ‘Senseless’ Killing</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Robert E.
