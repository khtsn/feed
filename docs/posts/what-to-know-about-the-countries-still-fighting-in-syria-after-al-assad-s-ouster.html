The country is also hosting nearly four million Syrian refugees who fled persecution by the Assad government, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would like them to leave and return home.</p><p>Turkey, which was once the seat of the vast Ottoman Empire that included much of Syria, has backed an array of different rebel groups that hold territory<span>  </span>along the Syrian-Turkish border.<span>  </span>One of those groups, Hayat Tahrir al Shams, which led the offensive that toppled Mr. al-Assad, had benefited from Turkey’s military presence in the area.</p><p>However, it is unclear whether Turkey approved the group’s decisive offensive. </p><p>Ankara’s closest ties are with the Syrian National Army, which has functioned almost as a proxy force for Turkey — in the past the army’s leadership <a href="https://tr.euronews.com/2018/08/12/-suriye-milli-ordusu-maasimiz-ve-gerektiginde-silahimiz-turkiye-den" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said</a> it received funding and weapons — and in turn it has pushed the Syrian Kurds, whom the Turks view as a security threat, back from the border. Even as the rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham<span>  </span>took control of the capital, Damascus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-kurds.html" title="">fighting flared between the Syrian National Army and the Kurds</a> in northeastern Syria, centered on Manbij, a Kurdish-controlled city near the border with Turkey. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Turkey now seems to be the foreign power with the most access and influence with the armed groups now in charge and in a prime position to pursue its own goals in Syria. That could mean further attacks against the Syrian Kurds, and the return of refugees who are currently in Turkey.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli soldiers in the Golan Heights in 2015.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Uriel Sinai for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-689da09">Israel</h2><p>Israel has fought three wars with Syria, and has had many more armed confrontations. It holds the mountainous territory in the southwest of Syria known as the Golan Heights, an annexation that is not recognized by the United Nations and many other countries. </p><p>During the civil war, Israel regularly conducted airstrikes against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s weapons stores and personnel in Syria. In April, it bombed an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus, killing senior Iranian military and intelligence officials</p><p>Within hours of the fall of the Assad regime, Israel moved troops into the Golan Heights, advancing beyond the demilitarized zone in its first overt entry into Syrian territory since the 1973 October War. It has also been carrying out airstrikes on stockpiles of chemical weapons inside Syria, along with air defense and missile sites.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Israel has touted its actions against Hamas and Hezbollah as instrumental in the overthrow of the Assad government. But it is not clear that a new government in Damascus, dominated by militant Islamists, will make Israel any safer. </p><h2 id="link-1b81f">Iran</h2><p>Iran’s relationship with Syria dates back almost 50 years, when Syria’s president at the time, Hafez Assad, supported Iran in its eight-year war with Iraq. As Iran built a network of like-minded groups across the Middle East as a counterweight against the United States and Israel, Syria was the only state to become part of what became known as the “Axis of Resistance.” </p><p>Syria became Iran’s main overland supply route to transport weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. In return, Iran sent military advisers to support the Assad regime during the civil war, along with fighters from its ally Hezbollah and two brigades under the command of Iran’s Quds Forces that was made up of refugees from Pakistan and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/world/middleeast/us-strike-afghans-iran.html" title="">Afghanistan</a> who had fled to Iran.</p><p>With Mr. al-Assad forced to flee Syria, Iran will lose much of its military leverage in<span>  </span>Lebanon and Syria. Its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/irans-syria-axis-of-resistance.html" title="">hopes for an “Axis of Resistance” that reached the Mediterranean have unraveled</a> — at least for now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jet at an air base in Syria in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxime Popov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-6a6c16d">Russia</h2><p>The Russian relationship with Syria dates to the days of the Soviet Union. At the end of the Cold War, with the United States asserting its presence in Arab countries, Russia saw the Assad government as a crucial ally in the Middle East, one that could provide a counterweight to the American presence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>During the Syrian civil war, Russia made it a priority to keep its ally in power. It also saw the Syrian leader as a bulwark against Islamist extremism from Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Russia sold weapons to the Assad government, deployed fighters from Russia’s Wagner group, expanded its naval base in Tartus, Syria, and opened an air base near Damascus.</p><p>With the demise of the Assad regime, Russia could lose much of its influence in Syria,<span>  </span>but analysts say it probably will try to keep its Tartus base, which is its only Mediterranean port<span>  </span>for its Black Sea fleet<span>  </span>It is making conciliatory gestures toward the rebel forces who now control the country, and has said it is too soon to make any decisions about the fate of its military bases in Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>American Special Forces troops outside the northern Syrian city of Manbij, in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mauricio Lima for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-3405d786">United States</h2><p>The U.S.-Syria relationship with<span>  </span>has never been particularly friendly. The United States<span>   </span>severed diplomatic relations in 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war, and <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-islamic-state-five-years-later-persistent-threats-u-s-options/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">placed</a> Syria on its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1979.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The main<span>  </span>U.S. interest in Syria is the defeat of the Islamic State, which maintains a presence in the northeastern and central parts of the country. In 2019, during Donald Trump’s first term as president, he pulled most U.S. forces out of Syria, but about 1,000 U.S. Special Operations troops remain, and they<span>  </span>work closely with Syrian Kurdish troops trained by the United States. </p><p>President Biden said on Sunday that the U.S. military has been conducting airstrikes in Syria to keep the Islamic State from reasserting itself in the power vacuum created by Mr. al-Assad’s ouster. He said the United States would support the region “should any threat arrive from Syria during this period of transition.”</p><p>“We’re cleareyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to re-establish its capability, to create a safe haven,” Mr. Biden said. “We will not let that happen.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alissa J.
