But with two offhand responses to questions from reporters, the American president offered an unusual glimpse into the targeting and timing of a military attack being prepared by an ally.</p><p>First, Mr. Biden said that the United States was “in discussion” about the possibility that Israel might strike Iran’s vast oil fields, a move that would dramatically escalate the conflict. He seemed to indicate some concern about that military option, saying that “I think that would be a little — ” but quickly stopped himself midsentence and said, “Anyway.”</p><p>Responding to another question about possible Israeli attacks on Iran, he said: “There’s nothing going to happen today. We’ll talk about that later.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was a moment that underscored the power of the presidency — or at least the power of a president’s words. It has always been the case that everything the Oval Office occupant says is transcribed and parsed as it bounces around the world. But now it does so at the speed of social media, and there is nowhere to hide.</p><p>Both of Mr. Biden’s comments on Thursday quickly became headlines in Israel because leaders there have so far remained vague about where and when they might be striking Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “we will stand by the rule we established: Whoever attacks, we will attack them.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has also added that Iran’s decision to fire more than 200 ballistic missiles at Israel this week was “a big mistake” and that Iran “will pay for it.” But he has avoided offering any specifics.</p><p>The response to Mr. Biden’s surprising bout of clarity?</p><p>Oil prices rose more than 4 percent on Thursday, reflecting a queasiness among investors that a broader war in the Middle East could disrupt oil supplies.</p><p>It is far from certain that Israel is preparing to strike Iran’s oil-producing capabilities. But even the hint of it from Mr. Biden was enough to send a jolt of concern around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The president’s comment about the timing of a possible strike was not a great surprise. Military experts had predicted Israel would not attack Iran until after the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, which started at sundown on Wednesday and continues through most of Friday.</p><p>But Mr. Biden is among the people who might actually know the answer to that question. So to hear him casually tell everyone what he knows was striking.</p><p>The disclosures on Thursday were nowhere near top secret, and Mr. Biden is not the only president who has blurted out information that his aides or others might have preferred he keep to himself. (Former President Donald J. Trump, for example, has been known to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/world/middleeast/trump-iran-missile-explosion-satellite-image.html" title="">post confidential information on social media</a>.)</p><p>Mr. Biden, who has only a few months left in his presidency, has a long history of making off-the-cuff comments — and sometimes they get him into trouble. In a speech in Warsaw in 2022, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-biden.html" title="">ad-libbed his thoughts</a> about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” The comment immediately triggered concerns about whether the United States was calling for his ouster. His aides spent hours arguing that he had simply misspoken.</p><p>On Thursday, White House officials declined to comment about Mr. Biden’s latest comments to a group of reporters who had gathered at the White House to observe his departure on Marine One.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>With the engine of the helicopter roaring just feet away, Mr. Biden took a few questions, including one on the recent vice-presidential debate and another on whether he planned to talk to Mr. Putin at an upcoming summit.</p><p>He was also asked about the possibility that the United States might find other ways to punish Iran for the missile attack.</p><p>“What kind of sanctions are you considering on Iran?” a reporter asked. “What kind of sanctions are you considering?”</p><p>In that instance, at least, Mr. Biden thought better of revealing much.</p><p>“I’ll tell them before I tell you,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
