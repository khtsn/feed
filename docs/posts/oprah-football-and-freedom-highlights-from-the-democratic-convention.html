So the next time you hear him, don’t count the lies. Count the “I”s.

Nomination</h2><h4>Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota introduced his family and rallied the crowd to get behind Kamala Harris in “the fourth quarter” of the election.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“It’s the honor of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We also protected reproductive freedom because in Minnesota we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. And even if we wouldn’t make those same choices for ourselves, we’ve got a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. It took Gwen and I years, but we had access to fertility treatments. And when our daughter was born, we named her Hope. Hope, Gus and Gwen, you are my entire world. And I love you. I’m letting you in on how we started a family because this is a big part about what this election is about: freedom. So here, this is the part — clip and save it and send it to your undecided relatives so they know — if you’re a middle-class family or a family trying to get into the middle class, Kamala Harris is going to cut your taxes. If you’re getting squeezed by prescription drug prices, Kamala Harris is going to take on big pharma. If you’re hoping to buy a home, Kamala Harris is going to help make it more affordable. And no matter who you are, Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead. You know, you might not know it, but I haven’t given a lot of big speeches like this, but I have given a lot of pep talks. So let me finish with this team.” Crowd chanting: “Coach.” “It’s the fourth quarter. We’re down a field goal, but we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field. And boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced and Kamala Harris is ready.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/21/multimedia/21election-live-takeaways-walz-kgth/21election-live-takeaways-walz-kgth-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Gov.

He kept it short, and, even as he introduced himself to millions of Americans for the first time, heeded the cardinal rule of vice-presidential protocol: never upstage the boss.</p></div></div><div><div><p>His speech ran for a crisp 16 minutes, about half the length of Mr. Clinton’s expansive address. He knew his role, and was sure to praise the woman who had plucked him from semi-obscurity and brought him to the biggest stage in global politics.</p><p>“No matter who you are, Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead because that’s what we want for ourselves,” he said, adding: “Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced. And Kamala Harris is ready.”</p><p>Ms. Harris calls her running mate “Coach Walz” and he signaled his understanding of the role, with his sole focus getting his star quarterback, Ms. Harris, to the end zone.</p><p>“Our job for everyone watching is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling,” he told the crowd. “We’re going to leave it on the field.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J.

But the Harris team, perhaps worried about complacency, appeared to go out of its way to lace at least some speeches with reminders that Mr. Trump remains a stubborn and fierce opponent. The good times most certainly would not, could not, last forever.</p><p>“We feel like a lot is off our shoulders, we are happy,” Mr. Clinton said. But, he added, “We’ve seen more than one election slip away from us when we thought it couldn’t happen when people get distracted by phony issues or overconfident.”</p><p>He knew this much: “This is a brutal, tough business.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Rutenberg is a writer at large for The Times and The New York Times Magazine and writes most often about media and politics.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/bill-clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/22/us/politics/dnc-takeaways-tim-walz.html">1</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
