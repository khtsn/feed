Today it’s betting that Kim Kardashian can help it do the same for women’s activewear.</p><p>On Tuesday, Nike is announcing the creation of NikeSkims, a new brand in partnership with Skims, the shapewear Goliath co-founded by Ms. Kardashian. NikeSkims marks the first time that Nike has joined with an existing, outside company to introduce a new brand.</p><p>“It’s this great clash of performance product — athlete tested, athlete inspired — with Skims’s incredible attention to the female form of the body and inclusivity,” said Heidi O’Neill, the president of consumer, product and brand at Nike.</p><p>The brand, she said, will “serve women so they can feel strong and sexy.”</p><p>The two companies have been working on NikeSkims since October 2023. Skims, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/style/kim-kardashian-skims-swarovski.html" title="">conquered the shapewear market</a> with its curve-accentuating leggings, bodysuits and tops, first reached out to Nike about working together.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The initial crop of products will hit Skims and Nike websites and select stores in the United States in spring 2025. NikeSkims will roll out globally next year.</p><p>If Skims’s shapewear is designed for everyday wear, NikeSkims will be targeted toward hourlong HIIT classes and sweaty treadmill sessions. It will utilize existing training-tested textiles, like Dri-Fit, as well as “innovations that are built more uniquely for Skims,” according to Ms. O’Neill. She did not share specifics on pricing, but a pair of Nike’s high-waist Dri-Fit leggings sells for $60, just a smidgen more than Skims’s $56 cotton leggings.</p><p>NikeSkims will focus on women’s apparel, with plans to add footwear and accessories in the future. Jens Grede, the chief executive and co-founder of Skims, said it was not out of the question for it to expand into men&#39;s wear. NikeSkims, similar to Air Jordan, will have its own dedicated staff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The first crop of NikeSkims products will hit Skims and Nike stores this spring.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NikeSkims</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>NikeSkims arrives at a moment of soaring interest in women’s sports, like basketball. Skims, coincidentally, is already the official underwear partner of the W.N.B.A., as well as the N.B.A. and U.S.A. Basketball.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Women’s sports, Ms. O’Neill said, aren’t a trend but “a transformation.” The company, she noted, saw double-digit growth in its women’s sports business over the last two years.</p><p>In working with Skims, Nike also gets instant access to one of the most visible women on planet. Ms. Kardashian has more than 358 million Instagram followers and gamely stars in many of Skims’s promotional clips. In a video uploaded to Skims’s Instagram last week, Ms. Kardashian, dressed in a tonal tan bodysuit, assumed the role of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DF8gXA4Tyse/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fairy Butt Mother</a> to a hapless gymgoer.</p><p>Nike and Skims were mum on how their new partnership would be marketed, but Ms. O&#39;Neill praised Ms. Kardashian as an “incredible business leader” in a way that reminded her of Mr. Jordan.</p><p>Mr. Grede went further in talking up his co-founder: “It’s hard not to think of her as the Michael Jordan of influencers,” he said.</p><p>For Skims, the Nike pairing is another avenue of expansion for a company that in its six years has risen from a striver in the shapewear industry to its key player.</p><p>In 2023, Skims was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/business/dealbook/skims-kim-kardashian-fundraise.html" title="">valued at $4 billion</a> and today has six stores across the United States. “Skims deserves to be a public company one day,” Mr. Grede said, acknowledging investor speculation, but for now the company is “very much enjoying what we’re doing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In Nike, Skims found a partner offering not only field-researched materials and production capabilities, but an expansive distribution network. The aim is for NikeSkims products to be sold through Nike’s retail partners in the near future.</p><p>“We didn’t want to go into this very large category and do something small,” Mr. Grede said. Skims, he said, wanted to do something grand and unexpected, and “Nike gave us the opportunity to do it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Style Coverage</h2><h3>The latest in fashion, trends, love and more.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Ankle Monitor?
