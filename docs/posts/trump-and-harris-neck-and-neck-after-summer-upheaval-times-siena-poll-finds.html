Both candidates have scant opportunity to shift the electorate, but for Mr. Trump, opinions are largely fixed. Ms. Harris is still unknown to many.</p><p>In that sense, the new poll underscores the risks and potential rewards, particularly facing Ms. Harris, on Tuesday night, when she and Mr. Trump will face off on ABC News. The survey found that 28 percent of likely voters said they felt they needed to know more about Ms. Harris, while only 9 percent said they needed to know more about Mr. Trump.</p><p>These voters, when taken with the 5 percent of voters who said they were undecided or did not lean toward either major-party candidate, paint a portrait of an electorate that could be more fluid than it seems. Some who are considering Ms. Harris said they still hoped to learn more before solidifying their decision, and two-thirds of those who want to know more said they were eager to learn about her policies, specifically.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="table-national" data-id="100000009676246" data-source-id="100000009676246"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">How the Times/Siena poll compares</h2></header><div data-sourceid="100000009676246" id="embed-id-100000009676246">

She continues to struggle to build a solid lead with Latino voters, a crucial demographic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-8"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>If November is about change, Ms. Harris will need to make the case that she can deliver it. More than 60 percent of likely voters said the next president should represent a major change from Mr. Biden, but only 25 percent said the vice president represented that change, while 53 percent said Mr. Trump, the former president, did.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I don’t see how Kamala Harris instead of Trump would bring change,” said Steven Osborne, a 43-year-old plumber and Trump supporter in Branson, Mo. “I mean, she’s Joe Biden’s vice president. How can she be seen as different?”</p><p>Another warning sign for Democrats: 47 percent of likely voters viewed Ms. Harris as too liberal, compared with 32 percent who saw Mr. Trump as too conservative.</p><p>On the plus side for Ms. Harris, the Democrats’ hammering away at Project 2025 as a blueprint for another Trump presidency has sunk in. The former president has tried hard to distance himself from the document, drafted by the conservative Heritage Foundation with input from Trump allies, which lays out plans for a second Trump presidency.</p><p>Among the many recommendations in the <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">900-page document</a>, Project 2025 proposes to criminalize pornography, disband the Commerce and Education departments, reject the idea of abortion as health care and shred climate protections.</p><p>Three-quarters of likely voters said they had heard about Project 2025, and of those, 63 percent said they opposed it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It’s a horrible affront to American democracy,” said John Fisher, 71, a retiree in the pivotal swing area of Delaware County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, and a registered Republican who is supporting Ms. Harris. “It’s a disgrace.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s distancing aside, 71 percent of those who have heard of Project 2025 said they believed that the former president would try to enact some or most of the policies that it espouses.</p><p>Working in Mr. Trump’s favor is the fact that voters remain largely pessimistic about the direction of the country. Just 30 percent of likely voters said the country was on the right track, largely unchanged since July. But among voters who thought the country was headed in the wrong direction, 71 percent were optimistic that things would get back on the right track, an improvement since 2022, when voters were more pessimistic about the nation’s direction.</p><p>Democrats do have a slight edge when it comes to enthusiasm for voting: 91 percent of Democrats said they were enthusiastic, compared with 85 percent of Republicans.</p><p><em>[Follow </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title=""><em>the latest polls</em></a><em> and see updated </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title=""><em>polling averages of the Harris vs. Trump matchup</em></a><em>.]</em></p><p>“Oh, heavens, when it was Biden and Trump, it was the first time in my entire life I was like, I don’t know if I can vote this year,” said Carol Ploeger, 68, of Provo, Utah, who added that she would be voting for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in her life. “I feel like she’s got new blood, she’s younger, she knows what the American people need because she came from humble beginnings.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump holds a 13-percentage-point advantage on the issue that remains most important to voters: the economy. Ms. Harris holds a 15-percentage-point advantage on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/us/elections/abortion-polls-women-trump-harris.html" title="">another leading issue</a>: abortion.</p><p>Ms. Harris faces a challenge with voters who hold her responsible for the Biden administration’s handling of some issues. About half of voters, largely Republicans, said Harris bore at least some blame for rising prices and problems during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And nearly two-thirds of voters, from across the political spectrum, said she bore at least some blame for problems at the southwestern border.</p><p>Matthew Tucker, a 31-year-old vaccine scientist in Cambridge, Mass., said he intended to vote for Ms. Harris and he did not vote in 2020. But he said he felt that the vice president bore responsibility for the problems at the border.</p><p>“It’s not like I’d lay it all on her,” he said, “but I’m not sure that I heard enough about her trying to deal with that. And I would like to hear more from Democrats or Republicans on more creative solutions to that problem, rather than just putting up walls.”</p><p>On abortion, Mr. Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, has muddied the waters a bit. It is Ms. Harris’s strongest issue, with 54 percent of voters trusting her to handle it, compared with 39 percent who trust Mr. Trump. Yet 16 percent of Democrats and nearly half of independents said they did not think the former president would try to pass a law restricting abortion access nationwide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-17"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="traits" data-id="100000009676248" data-source-id="100000009676248"><div data-sourceid="100000009676248" id="embed-id-100000009676248">

Voters were only slightly more likely to view the former president — who was impeached twice and convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a sex scandal that threatened his 2016 presidential campaign — as a riskier choice for the country than Ms. Harris. Fifty-four percent viewed Mr. Trump as a risky choice, compared with 52 percent who said the same about Ms. Harris.</p><p>The survey found that 70 percent of voters said that Mr. Trump had said something they found offensive. Nearly half of Trump voters said that they had been offended by him at some point but that they would still vote for him.</p><p>There was a sharp division on when voters found Mr. Trump’s comments offensive. Ninety-four percent of Ms. Harris’s voters said that Mr. Trump had said something they found offensive, with 78 percent saying that he had offended them recently.
