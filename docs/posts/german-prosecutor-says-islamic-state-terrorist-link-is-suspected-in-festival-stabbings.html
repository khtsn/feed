The man, wearing bloodstained clothes, approached a police car and gave himself up after 11 p.m. Saturday, according to law enforcement officials.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/world/europe/solingen-germany-knife-attack.html" title="">The police said the assailant</a> aimed for his victims’ necks to inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, the federal prosecutor’s office said it believed the suspect, identified only as Issa Al H. in keeping with strict German privacy rules, had joined the Islamic State. Officials are also investigating him on possible charges of murder and attempted murder, though so far no official charges have been filed.</p><p>The suspect “shared the ideology” of the terrorist organization and “joined the group at an undeterminable” time before Friday’s attack, Ines Peterson, spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor, said in a statement Sunday.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Islamic State took responsibility for the attack, praising the attacker as a “soldier of the Islamic State,” <a href="https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-Threat-Statements/is-takes-credit-for-knife-attack-in-solingen-germany.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to Site Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist organizations.</p><p>On Sunday, the site of the attack was still cordoned off and guarded by the police, but mourners gathered at an adjacent church to light candles, lay flowers and leave condolence messages on a large white banner.</p><p>“This is the first year we skipped the festival and then this happens,” said Tanya Zastrov, 50, a resident of Solingen, referring to the town’s 650th birthday festival that the attack so tragically upended. “I’m shocked and speechless,” she added.</p><p>Solingen, a city of over 150,000, is ethnically diverse and some condolence messages were written in other languages besides German, such as Turkish and Greek. During its boom years in the 1960s and 1970s, the city relied on foreign workers to fill its production plants.</p><p>“If someone opens the door for you, then you should be grateful,” said Ahmet Kalayci, 58, who moved to Solingen from Turkey when he was 16. He added: “Then you should behave.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The attack on Friday occurred less than three months after a similar attack by an Afghan refugee in Manheim, another ethnically diverse city in the country’s west, about 130 miles south of Solingen. In that case, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/europe/activist-officer-stabbing-germany.html" title="">an Afghan refugee attacked an anti-immigrant rally</a> with a knife and killed a police officer who tried to intervene.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/arts/music/taylor-swift-concert-terror-plot-vienna.html" title="">three Taylor Swift tour dates were canceled</a> in Vienna after U.S. intelligence officials warned their Austrian counterparts that two teenagers were planning on attacking the crowds gathered for the event. The main suspect in that plot had radicalized online, officials said, and had filmed himself swearing allegiance to the Islamic State.</p><p>The far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has campaigned largely on an anti-immigrant platform and is poised to make significant gains in three state elections next month, jumped on the news of the Solingen attack. Even before the identity of the attacker was confirmed by the police, one of its leaders called for changes to <a href="https://x.com/Tino_Chrupalla/status/1827245563395379374" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“migration and security policy.”</a></p><p>The authorities had earlier arrested two people who were later determined unlikely to have been the actual attackers, Herbert Reul, the state interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Solingen is, said in an interview on Saturday with a German broadcaster, ARD.</p><p>A 15-year-old boy, who was arrested early Saturday, is being investigated for not having alerted the police when he learned about imminent plans to attack, prosecutors said. A man arrested by a heavily armed police unit on Saturday evening in the refugee housing facility where the main suspect also lived is being treated as a witness, the police and Mr. Reul said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>On Saturday, Solingen’s mayor, the state governor and other political leaders gathered on a downtown square several hundred yards from where the attack took place to mourn the victims. It was an eerie repeat of a similar impromptu service held in Mannheim after the attack there.<span>  </span></p><p>On Sunday, which was supposed to be the final day of joyous festival celebrating a city best known for making knives and scissors, the downtown was mostly deserted.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
