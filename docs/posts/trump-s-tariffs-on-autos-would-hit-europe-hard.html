And their first wave, meant to hit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/business/economy/whiskey-tariffs.html" title="">American whiskey</a> and motorcycles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/us-tariffs-eu-whiskey.html" title="">was delayed</a> to allow for more negotiating time and over fears of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-tariff-european-union-whiskey.html" title="">stark American response</a> that could crush <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/business/france-champagne-wine-tariffs-trump.html" title="">European wine and Champagne exports</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The latest U.S. move may intensify the urgency for the European Union to retaliate. Automotive tariffs could squeeze an industry that is already vulnerable — especially in Europe’s biggest economy, Germany, which sends American consumers <a href="https://www.jato.com/resources/media-and-press-releases/trump-tariffs-would-impact-nearly-20-percent-of-cars-sales-in-the-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cars from companies like</a> Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW. That makes the tariffs a serious escalation in a trade war that has already left Europe scrambling.</p><p>“I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on European automotive exports,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>The European Union will “assess this announcement, together with other measures the U.S. is envisaging in the next days,” she added, and will “continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.”</p><p>The United States is the European Union’s largest export market for cars, accounting for nearly a quarter of all its exported vehicles.</p><p>In 2024, European automakers sent 38.4 billion euros’ worth of cars across the Atlantic, <a href="https://www.acea.auto/files/Economic_and_Market_Report-Full_year-2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">down 4.6 percent</a> from the previous year, according to the European automobile makers association, ACEA.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Auto tariffs “will definitely be a big bummer for the recently returned optimism in Europe,” said Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro for ING Research. In particular, they could “hurt German exports and increase chances of a continued stagnation.”</p><p>The biggest three German carmakers make up <a href="https://www.jato.com/resources/media-and-press-releases/trump-tariffs-would-impact-nearly-20-percent-of-cars-sales-in-the-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 73 percent</a> of the European Union’s automotive exports to the United States, according to the research firm JATO Dynamics.</p><p>And the United States is the most important export market for Germany’s auto industry. Nearly one of every three Porsches is exported to the United States, while one of every six BMWs is shipped there. Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi (a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group) have production sites in the United States and Mexico, but they would be hard hit by the increase in tariffs.</p><p>BMW warned this month that it expected that the growing trade conflicts would cost the company $1 billion this year.</p><p>“If you overdo it with tariffs, it sends a negative spiral to all market participants,” Oliver Zipse, the chairman of BMW, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/bmw-expects-to-take-1-billion-hit-from-growing-tariff-war?sref=zVYYYI5e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a>. There are “no winners in that game.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cars are just one sector facing steep tariff increases. On top of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_740" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tariffs on steel and aluminum</a>, the United States is planning to announce what the administration calls “reciprocal” tariffs next Wednesday.</p><p>The goal of those, the administration says, is to equalize tariff rates between various nations and America.</p><p>Maros Sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the European Commission, and Bjoern Seibert, the head of cabinet for the commission’s president, visited Washington on Tuesday to talk to their American counterparts — Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative.</p><p>On Wednesday, European ambassadors heard an account of those meetings, according to three diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.</p><p>The takeaway was that reciprocal tariffs could be in the double digits, two of the diplomats said — perhaps even 20 percent or higher, one added, though the figure was uncertain and the range of estimates wide. The tariffs would apply across the board for E.U. countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The EU’s priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs,” Mr. Sefcovic said on X <a href="https://x.com/MarosSefcovic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after his meetings</a> this week. “We share the goal of industrial strength on both sides.”</p><p>Although the European Union has a relatively low tariff rate on average, the United States has signaled that it will take other factors into account when calculating reciprocal tariffs — including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/business/economy/trump-vat-tax-europe.html" title="">value-added taxes</a>. Those are consumption taxes added to a good or service at each stage of production, and they are given back to the exporter if a product is exported. Mr. Trump has been a longtime critic of those policies.</p><p>Mr. Trump said while announcing the auto tariffs on Wednesday that the coming reciprocal tariffs would be “lenient” and that “we’re going to be very fair.” He offered few concrete details.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>March 26, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the value of the cars that European automakers sent across the Atlantic last year. It was 38.4 billion euros, not €38.4 million.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
