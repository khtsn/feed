Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese bicycles in 2018, Arnold Kamler, then the chief executive of the bike maker Kent International, saw a curious trend play out in the bicycle industry.</p><p>Chinese bicycle factories moved their final manufacturing and assembly operations out of China, setting up new facilities in Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and India. Using parts mostly from China, those companies made bicycles that they could export directly to the United States — without paying the 25 percent tariff had the bike been shipped straight from China.</p><p>“The net effect of what’s going on with these tariffs is that Chinese factories in China are setting up Chinese factories in other countries,” said Mr. Kamler, whose company imports some bicycles from China and makes others at a South Carolina factory.</p><p>Pushing those factories into other countries resulted in additional costs for companies and consumers, without increasing the amount of manufacturing in the United States, Mr. Kamler said. He said he had been forced to raise his prices several times as a result of the tariffs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“There’s no real gain here,” said Mr. Kamler, whose bikes are sold at Walmart and other retailers. “It’s very inflationary.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Arnold Kamler said he had to raise prices at Kent International several times as a result of President Donald J. Trump’s 2018 tariffs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kate Thornton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As Mr. Trump prepares to return to office with sweeping plans to impose more levies on foreign goods, economists and business owners are pointing to unintended consequences that resulted from his tariffs the first time around. Beginning in 2018, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign metals, washing machines, solar panels and products from China. His administration said the levies would force companies to set up factories in the United States.</p><p>Some industries that compete with cheap Chinese products — like apparel and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/us/politics/trump-harris-tariffs.html" title="">cabinet makers</a> — credit Mr. Trump’s tariffs with keeping American manufacturers in business.</p><p>But for many other industries, the tariffs simply spurred a global reshuffling of manufacturing operations, one that did little to strengthen U.S. production or reduce ties with Chinese firms. Companies have merely shifted their factories to other low-cost countries in Asia or Latin America instead, and U.S. imports <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/briefing/vietnam-china-us-trade-war.html" title="">from those countries have surged</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some companies have severed their ties with China. But others have retained close connections, even as they have moved their operations out of China. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/29/business/economy/china-us-trade-supply-chain.html" title="">Economists</a> <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/as-the-u-s-is-derisking-from-china-Other-foreign-u-s-suppliers-are-relying-more-on-chinese-imports-20240802.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a> many companies, both Chinese and multinational, have continued to rely on Chinese products and parts, which are now flowing into the United States from factories set up outside China’s borders.</p><p>In other words, some Chinese products are merely taking a longer trip around the world on their way to the United States, in an attempt to avoid tariffs. Rather than making global supply chains stronger and more diversified, economists say, this may be weakening them — while adding costs for companies and consumers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Factory workers heading to a night shift in Vietnam, which has served as a “connector country” through which trade and investment have been rerouted.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linh Pham for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/05/07/sp-geopolitics-impact-global-trade-and-dollar-gita-gopinath#:~:text=The%20emergence%20of%20these%20%E2%80%9Cconnector,resilience%20remains%20an%20open%20question." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a speech in May</a>, Gita Gopinath, the first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said trade and investment were being rerouted through what she called “connector countries,” partly offsetting the erosion of more direct links between the United States and China.</p><p>The role of these connector countries, most notably Mexico and Vietnam, “may have helped cushion the global economic impact of direct trade decoupling between the U.S. and China,” Ms. Gopinath said. “But whether it has helped to diversify exposures and increase supply chain resilience remains an open question.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Brad Setser, an economist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the main effect of U.S. levies on China was to encourage companies to “find a way around the bilateral tariff.”</p><p>“It reduces bilateral trade; it doesn’t impact global trade,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Setser added that China’s role as a global exporter had not diminished, and that neither had the United States’ role as an importer. It was just the countries through which trade was being routed that had shifted.</p><p>“Even though we have less direct bilateral trade, in a global sense, there’s one surplus country, China, and there’s one deficit country, the U.S.,” Mr. Setser said. “We are still interconnected indirectly.”</p><p>Trade data reflects this: The gap between the goods the United States exports to and imports from China narrowed to $278 billion in 2023 from $417 billion in 2018. While that level is set to rebound this year, economists say U.S. imports of goods from China that are covered by tariffs have clearly dropped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Port of Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province, China.

Economists say exports to the United States from some of those countries now contain more Chinese parts and raw materials than they did before.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump and his advisers are eyeing these new back doors that Chinese products are using to enter the United States. Mr. Trump has proposed an additional 60 percent tariff on U.S. imports from China, as well as a “universal” tariff of 10 to 20 percent on goods from elsewhere.</p><p>He and his advisers also appear to have doubts about the trade deal they renegotiated with Mexico, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A. They want to adjust its rules to try to ensure that more Chinese cars and auto parts will not find their way to the United States through Mexico.</p><p>But it is unclear how effective their efforts will be against the creativity of global companies that are driven by strong financial incentives to maintain access to the U.S. market.</p><p>In industry after industry, Chinese companies have found footholds abroad that allow them to bypass trade barriers with the United States. After the United States put hefty tariffs on Chinese solar panels, for example, many Chinese companies opened solar factories in Southeast Asia. U.S. solar companies have initiated trade cases, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/business/economy/tariffs-solar-industry-china.html" title="">successfully appealing</a> to the government for more protection from these factories.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A car dealership in Mexico City.

But economists and business owners say some of it is undoubtedly an effort to circumvent Mr. Trump’s 2018 China tariffs, which the Biden administration has kept in place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In some cases, global companies have also used accounting and tax tricks to make it appear that their shipments from China are lower, and thus pay fewer tariffs, without making major changes to their supply chains.</p><p>Lynlee Brown, a partner in Ernst &amp; Young’s global trade practice, said there were many strategies that companies could pursue to reduce the tariffs they paid, having to do with the way U.S. customs officials assign tariff rates to different products.</p><p>For example, an electronics company might move one important stage of its supply chain out of China and into Vietnam. That could allow the company to report to U.S. customs agents that the export came from Vietnam, even if the good is still finished in China and exported from China to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A factory under construction in Hai Phong, Vietnam.

They can officially lower the value of the import by stripping out certain “intangible” costs, like payments for intellectual property, royalties, brand or research and development, and recording those to other global subsidiaries. By lowering the value of the import, they then pay a lower tariff.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>It is unclear how much tactics like this have lowered the recorded value of trade between the United States and China, without really changing physical trade flows. U.S. customs duties spiked after the tariffs went into effect, but <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B235RC1Q027SBEA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have fallen back</a> since the beginning of 2022, possibly reflecting some of these changes.</p><p>But Ms. Brown said tax and accounting methods had allowed some companies to lower their tariff burden without changing “their physical supply chain at all.”</p><p>“They did some fancy footwork within the customs regulations that impacts the value they declared for the products,” she said.</p><p>Alan Wm. Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former deputy director general of the World Trade Organization, said he anticipated an attempt by the Trump administration to follow Chinese trade further down the path it was taking through other countries to the United States.</p><p>But ultimately, those trade measures would not affect the U.S. economy much if the United States and China did not make bigger economic changes, he said.</p><p>“The U.S. has a trade deficit of a trillion dollars,” he said. “If we don’t change our macroeconomic policies, we’re going to have a trade deficit of a trillion dollars rearranged.”</p><p>Claire Fu<!-- --> contributed reporting from Seoul.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
