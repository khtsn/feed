The authorities said that they believed the attack was deliberate, but that the driver, who was arrested shortly after the attack, acted alone.</p><p>The German authorities said the driver of the SUV was a male, 50-year-old citizen of Saudi Arabia who had lived in Germany for decades on a visa that granted him permanent residency. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Video broadcast on German television showed a man with a trim beard and round, wire-rimmed glasses lying prone on the ground beside a BMW with a crumpled front fender and grill, as officers pointing pistols at him shouted at him not to move.</p><p>The police searched an apartment in a town 25 miles south of Magdeburg where the man was reported to have lived and worked as a psychotherapist. He first came to Germany in 2006, the authorities said. They have not released the man’s name.</p><p>The doctor had an active social media presence that included postings criticizing Germany for what he called the authorities’ tolerance of radical Islam, German news media reported. A security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that those reports were accurate.</p><p>In his social media, the man also expressed support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party and reposted comments by party leaders warning of the threat of Islamic law being imposed in Germany.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, accompanied by several of his ministers, on Saturday visited the site of the attack in Magdeburg.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronny Hartmann/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This year, knives were banned at holiday markets across the country, after an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/world/europe/germany-festival-attack.html" title="">armed man killed three people at a street festival</a> in August.</p><p>In Magdeburg, a line of large concrete blocks painted red and green had been placed at the entrance to the Christmas market, which was set up in narrow streets holding wooden stalls decorated with twinkling lights and selling hot mulled wine, sausages and gifts. But the driver appeared to have taken advantage of a gap along a tramline to plow into the crowd.</p><p>“It is not 100 percent possible to protect such events,” said Andreas Rosskopf, the head of the federal police union.</p><p>After Friday’s attack, cities across Germany sent extra patrols to the thousands of Christmas markets that remained open on Saturday. In Cologne, the authorities banned suitcases and larger bags at the market around the city’s cathedral. In Leipzig, the police set up extra barriers at the entrances to the market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We will need to speak about security, but not today,” Reiner Haseloff, the governor of Saxony-Anhalt state, told reporters on Saturday. “Today we are mourning.”</p><p>Germany needed to have an “intense discussion” about what it would take to “give citizens the feeling that in Germany, we not only have secure Christmas markets, but that we are able to live our lives how we want to,” Mr. Haseloff said.</p><p>Magdeburg, which is the capital of Saxony-Anhalt and has a population of about 240,000, was part of Communist East Germany. The annual market is set up in the center of the city, in front of City Hall. On Saturday, people came to lay flowers at a memorial set up on the steps of the Johanniskirche, or St. John’s Church, near the attack site.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial was set up on Saturday on the steps of the Johanniskirche, or St. John’s Church, near the attack site.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The pile of flowers at the steps of the church grew throughout the day on Saturday as visibly shaken people stopped by to pay their respects and to mourn.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Marko Heyer, 49, of Magdeburg, came with his wife to the church, both of them fighting back tears. Mr. Heyer recalled visiting the market — with its fairy-tale section with figures that recounted stories to children, as well as with the usual stands selling food and gifts — when he was a boy.</p><p>“In my opinion, it was the nicest Christmas market in Germany,” he said. “It will never be the same again.”</p><p>Surveillance footage circulating on social media and verified by The New York Times on Friday shows a car plowing into a large crowd at the market shortly after 7 p.m. The car then turns right onto another crowded street. Video of the aftermath shows people helping the wounded as cries are heard.</p><p>A couple who were at the market during the attack told a German television station that a black SUV suddenly careened into an alley packed with people who had come to celebrate the start of the last weekend before Christmas. The car drove some 1,200 feet before it stopped, officials said.</p><p>“It all happened so quickly,” the couple said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
