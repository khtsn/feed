The news provided more fuel for the polarizing debates over uncontrolled immigration that have swept Germany in recent years and as the country faces snap elections in February.</p><p>Of the people injured, 41 were severely hurt, the police in Magdeburg said. The authorities said that they believed the attack was deliberate, but that the driver acted alone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The police searched an apartment in a town 25 miles south of Magdeburg where the man was reported to have lived and worked as a psychotherapist. He first came to Germany in 2006, the authorities said. They have not released the man’s name.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, accompanied by several of his ministers, on Saturday visited the site of the attack in Magdeburg.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ronny Hartmann/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/europe/berlin-christmas-market-attack.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">an Islamic extremist rammed a semi truck into a crowd in at a Christmas market in central Berlin</a>, killing 13. Since then, bollards blocking the entrances to street festivals and holiday markets in Germany have become standard, as have security cameras and increased police presence, including plainclothes officers circulating among the crowds.</p><p>This year, knives were banned at holiday markets across the country, after an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/world/europe/germany-festival-attack.html" title="">armed man killed three people at a street festival</a> in August.</p><p>In Magdeburg, a line of large concrete blocks painted red and green had been placed at the entrance to the Christmas market, which was set up in narrow streets holding wooden stalls decorated with twinkling lights and selling hot mulled wine, sausages and gifts. But the driver appeared to have taken advantage of a gap along a tramline to plow into the crowd.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It is not 100 percent possible to protect such events,” said Andreas Rosskopf, the head of the federal police union.</p><p>After Friday’s attack, cities across Germany sent extra patrols to the thousands of Christmas markets that remained open on Saturday. In Cologne, the authorities banned suitcases and larger bags at the market around the city’s cathedral. In Leipzig, the police set up extra barriers at the entrances to the market.</p><p>“We will need to speak about security, but not today,” said Reiner Haseloff, the governor of Saxony-Anhalt state, told reporters on Saturday. “Today we are mourning.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial was set up on Saturday on the steps of the Johanniskirche, or St. John’s Church, near the attack site.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Magdeburg, which is the capital of Saxony-Anhalt and has a population of about 240,000, was part of Communist East Germany. The annual market is set up in the center of the city, in front of City Hall. On Saturday, people came to lay flowers at a memorial set up on the steps of the Johanniskirche, or St. John’s Church, near the attack site.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On Saturday morning, the wooden stands and their decorative stars along the alley that the driver plowed through appeared untouched, but with their lights extinguished. Paper was scattered on the ground and a table overturned.</p><p>Surveillance footage circulating on social media and verified by The New York Times on Friday shows a car plowing into a large crowd at the market shortly after 7 p.m. The car then turns right onto another crowded street. Video of the aftermath shows people helping the wounded as cries are heard.</p><p>A couple who were at the market during the attack told a German television station that a black SUV suddenly careened into an alley packed with people who had come to celebrate the start of the last weekend before Christmas. The car drove some 1,200 feet before it stopped, officials said.</p><p>“It all happened so quickly,” the couple said.</p><p>Immediately after the attack on Friday, emergency medical workers set up tents along the main road beside the market where they treated the injured who were later taken to the city’s main medical clinic. Others were flown to hospitals in nearby cities.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
