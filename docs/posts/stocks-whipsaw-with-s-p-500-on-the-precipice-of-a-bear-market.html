    <h1>Stocks Whipsaw With S&amp;P 500 on the Precipice of a Bear Market</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><div><p>A brutal day for markets around the world added to the pain of last week’s turmoil. The S&amp;P 500 ended nearly 18 percent below its February peak on Monday.</p><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="markets-embed-sp" data-id="100000008938528" data-source-id="100000008938528"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">S&amp;P 500</h2></header></section><div><ul><li><time datetime="2025-04-07T16:29:18-04:00"><span>Published <!-- -->April 6, 2025</span><span>Updated <!-- -->April 7, 2025, <span>4:29 p.m. ET</span></span></time></li></ul></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Wall Street weathered another chaotic day of trading on Monday, with false reports about a potential tariff reprieve briefly sending stocks higher before the White House rebuffed the idea and brought the prospects of a severe economic downturn back to the forefront.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 swung from a loss of as much as 4.7 percent, to a gain of as much as 3.4 percent in morning trading, the biggest intraday swing for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic. Volatility surged. The CBOE Vix Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, also rose to levels last seen during the pandemic-induced sell-off in March 2020.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 ended the day with a drop of 0.2 percent and 17.6 percent below its February peak. The index is on the precipice of a bear market — a rare marker of extreme market pessimism when stocks fall 20 percent from their peak.</p><p>The overarching concern for investors hasn’t changed. They are worried that steep tariffs imposed by the United States on huge swaths of imports, and the tit-for-tat response from China and other countries, will sink global growth and fuel inflation. Analysts noted that the cause of Monday’s brief rally — a false report that President Trump is considering delaying the new tariffs — showed just how desperate investors are for any sign that the White House is hearing their concerns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And it means turmoil in the markets won’t end any time soon, said <a href="https://www.yardeni.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edward Yardeni</a>, an independent Wall Street economist.</p><p>Asked earlier in the day about the possibility of a ninety day pause on the expansive tariffs announced by Mr. Trump last week, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on Fox News: “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.”</p><p>It appeared the comments, aired live, were then misinterpreted as Mr. Hassett saying the president is considering a pause, before the false information gathered steam on social media.</p><p>The hedge fund manager Bill Ackman had said on Sunday that he supported Mr. Trump’s attempt to fix global tariffs, but implored the president to call a “90-day time out” on Monday. Otherwise, “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down,” he said. “May cooler heads prevail.”</p><p>Analysts have warned that the damage to the economy will depend on how long tariffs remain at elevated levels.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders on Monday.</p><p>Some bank economists are already forecasting that the economy will slip into recession later this year. Others hold out hope that the strength of the economy before Mr. Trump took office can withstand the current turmoil ahead of being boosted by more business friendly policies later this year.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Trump doubled down, threatening China with a 104 percent tax on its exports to the United States starting later this week if it doesn’t rescind its tariffs on American products. After Mr. Trump announced last week that he would impose a new 34 percent tariff on China, Beijing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/china-trump-tariffs-retaliation.html" title="">responded</a> by threatening to impose a 34 percent tax on U.S. imports.</p><p>China’s levies are set to go into effect later this week, shortly after the Trump administration’s “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries are imposed. On Saturday, a 10 percent “baseline” tariff came into effect on nearly all goods coming into the United States.</p><p>Stocks in Europe fared far worse than those on Wall Street. A benchmark pan-European index fell 4.5 percent. Among the markets hardest hit in Asia were Hong Kong, where stocks plunged 13 percent, and Taiwan, where they tumbled 10 percent. Stocks in mainland China were down 7 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Over the weekend, analysts had circulated notes warning that Asia could be particularly vulnerable to a tit-for-tat exchange of retaliatory tariffs between China and the United States. Many countries in the region, including Japan and South Korea, count both nations as their top trading partners.</p><p>Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell more than 7 percent. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/economy/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-delay-tariffs.html" title="">Nintendo</a>, which cited tariffs when it delayed pre-orders for the sequel to its best-selling Switch video game console, declined more than 7 percent.</p><p>Oil prices fell about 2 percent, adding to steep losses last week and coming off their worst declines of the day.</p><p>The 10.5 percent drop in the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday and Friday was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-stocks-tariffs-trade.html" title="">worst two-day decline for the index</a> since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.</p><p>The only other instances of a worse two-day drop came during the 2008 financial crisis and the 1987 stock market crash, according Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. In dollar terms, the more than $5 trillion that was wiped out in the S&amp;P’s value in the two days last week stands unmatched.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even more unusual is that last week’s sell-off stemmed directly from presidential policy.</p><p>“If they’re maintained, the tariff hikes announced April 2 represent a self-inflicted economic catastrophe for the United States,” Preston Caldwell, a senior U.S. economist for Morningstar Research Services, <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/economy/tariffs-are-self-inflicted-economic-catastrophe" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a blog post</a> on Friday.</p><p>Chief executives have begun warning consumers that they should expect prices to increase on some groceries, clothes and other products. Consumers have said they intend to rein in spending on big-ticket items. Some auto companies have already announced production pauses overseas, as well as job losses domestically. Bank economists have raised the odds that a recession will hit the United States over the next 12 months.</p><p>Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said on Sunday on the NBC program “Meet The Press” that he saw “no reason” to expect a recession.</p><p>But analysts are worried.</p><p>“We remain very cautious,” said Stuart Kaiser, an equity analyst at Citi. Even with last week’s drop, he said, markets may have further to fall because earnings and economic growth expectations remain “well above levels consistent with announced tariff levels.”</p><p>Tony Romm<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.</p></div><div><p>Eshe Nelson is a reporter based in London, covering economics and business news for The New York Times.</p></div><div><p>River Akira Davis covers Japan, including its economy and businesses, and is based in Tokyo.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Framing the Past by Erasing Parts of It: </strong>As the Trump administration pulls government websites and data offline, it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/technology/trump-history-websites.html">selectively stripping away the public record</a>, letting President Trump declare his own version of history, archivists and historians said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weakened Cyberdefenses, Rising Danger:</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/nsa-director-haugh-trump-loomer.html">firing of the head of the National Security Agency</a> was only the latest move that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/trump-loomer-haugh-cyberattacks-elections.html">eroded the country’s fortifications against cyberattacks</a>, especially those targeting elections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loomer’s Role in Firings:</strong> The firing of national security officials on the advice of Laura Loomer, a far-right agitator and conspiracy theorist, unsettled even some veteran Trump officials.
