Some were in hits and some were in flops; they experienced joy and (in one case) trauma. A few have appeared onstage with regularity, while others pursued music or film and are now returning. Here they reflect on those early experiences.</em></p><hr/><p>☆ ☆ ☆</p><h2 id="link-32fb4a36">Nick Jonas</h2><p>Nick Jonas was just 8 when he landed a part as a Tiny Tim understudy in a 2000 production of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/09/theater/theater-review-a-holiday-standard-by-you-know-who.html?smid=url-share" title="">A Christmas Carol</a>” at Madison Square Garden (Frank Langella was Scrooge). A year later, at 9, he made his Broadway debut as Little Jake in a revival of “Annie Get Your Gun” then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/28/theater/new-star-fills-balcony-doin-what-comes-natur-lly-familiar-face-can-rejuvenate.html?smid=url-share" title="">starring Reba McEntire</a>.</p><p>He did two more Broadway shows in rapid succession: At 10 he played Chip, a teacup, in “Beauty and the Beast,” and at 11 he played Gavroche, a street child, in “Les Misérables.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Though he became a successful pop star in the years that followed, the stage kept calling: At 19, he returned to Broadway in “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.” And this spring, at 32, he is returning in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/16/theater/nick-jonas-adrienne-warren-broadway.html?smid=url-share" title="">the first Broadway production</a> of Jason Robert Brown’s much-loved “The Last Five Years.”</p><p>Like many of the actors interviewed here, Jonas said that in theater he found a group of peers who understood him in a way that classmates often did not. At school, Jonas said, “I definitely felt like I was strange to them.” But onstage, he said, “I finally felt like I was around my people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After several roles on Broadway, Nick Jonas, above center, became famous as part of the Jonas Brothers, performing with his brothers Joe and Kevin.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Krista Schlueter for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jonas, who was born in Texas and raised in New Jersey, said an adult who influenced him was the actor Rob McClure, who was an understudy in “I’m Not Rappaport” in 2002 when Jonas was in “Beauty and the Beast.” McClure, who lived near the Jonas family, would drive Nick to the city when they both had shows, and they would talk about acting, do improv bits and listen to tenors.</p><p>They would also watch videos of Broadway bloopers — comforting, because Jonas has long clung to the memory of missing a cue while in “Annie Get Your Gun.” “I literally had to bolt down from my fourth-story dressing room down to the stage and left Reba McEntire and Brent Barrett waiting for little Jake to arrive, and he didn’t,” Jonas said. “But, in the theme of that show, the show must go on. We have to adapt.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Now, as he prepares for the intense theater schedule, he says he wants to reconnect with the “joy and freedom” he felt as a child actor. “Back then it was just fun — I just got to do a thing I loved,” he said. “I think that for me to do my best work and to have the best experience I need to be loose and as carefree as I was then.”</p><p>Nick Jonas will star in “<a href="https://thelastfiveyearsbroadway.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Last Five Years</a>” starting March 18 at the Hudson Theater.</p><hr/><p>☆ ☆ ☆</p><h2 id="link-40ccdc6e">Sadie Sink</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sadie Sink landed a gig as a standby in the 2012 Broadway production of “Annie.” “But that ended up extending, and then that turned into being Annie,” she said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">WENN/Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The 2012 Broadway revival of “Annie” was underway when cast members started to get sick, and the production needed more understudies. That’s how Sadie Sink, at 10, landed a gig as a standby on Broadway — she was a Texan, but she was in New York because her brother was performing in “Elf,” and she knew “Annie” because she had starred in a production in Houston at Theater Under the Stars.</p><p>“I remember being at the Palace Theater, doing the same old ‘Annie’ songs I’d been singing my whole life at that point, and they cast me just to join for a bit as a placeholder while they needed extra coverage, but that ended up extending, and then that turned into being Annie,” she said. “It was a lot on my family, because moving from Texas to New York is not easy financially and logistically, but it just kind of happened, and I just remember it being this huge whirlwind of excitement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For a while, she was home-schooled, but she made plenty of friends because the “Annie” cast was filled with young girls who also loved theater.

In 1978, when he was 13, he played Anna’s son in a revival of “The King and I,” and in 1979 he starred in “Peter Pan” as John Darling.</p><p>That period of his life was traumatic because, he said, he was being sexually abused by someone he has not named. “During the ‘King and I’ era I ended up in a really bad, predatory situation that was prolonged, that took some work to get through,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He still considers his early childhood career a positive. “These are societal, systemic issues,” he said. “They’re not showbiz issues.
