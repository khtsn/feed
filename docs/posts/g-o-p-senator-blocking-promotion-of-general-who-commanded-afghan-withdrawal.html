Gen. Christopher T.

Trump has selected as his defense secretary, has indicated that he wants to fire Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., an Air Force fighter pilot who is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump transition officials have said they plan to go after generals in the Pentagon for a list of perceived crimes, including taking part in the Afghanistan evacuation and promoting diversity in the ranks.</p><p>And NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-transition-team-compiling-list-current-former-us-military-office-rcna180489" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Trump transition team is exploring whether generals who were involved in the Afghanistan evacuation can be court-martialed, although it is unclear how they could be held culpable for following lawful orders from the commander in chief.</p><p>But if that purge includes General Donahue, 55, who is known throughout the military as “C.D.” and who led the Army’s successful rush to speed aid to Ukraine in the early days of the Russian invasion, then the American military may soon see a wholesale change in leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I fought alongside C.D. in some of the most dangerous fighting along the Syrian border and can personally vouch for his individual bravery and leadership,” said Doug Philippone, who spent 18 years in the Army and was deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan and is a co-founder of the venture capital firm Snowpoint Ventures.</p><p>General Donahue, Mr. Philippone said, “is one of the few generals that are pushing full steam against the bureaucracy to innovate and modernize our military.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Mr. Mullin’s office declined to comment.</p><p>The Oklahoma senator has been a vocal critic of the Afghanistan evacuation, a process that began during the first administration of Mr. Trump, who signed an agreement with the Taliban in February 2020 stipulating that American troops would leave Afghanistan by May 1, 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Afghans trying to leave the country were gathered outside the perimeter fence of the international airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But Mr. Mullin has reserved his criticism for the Biden administration, which carried out the Afghan withdrawal. In 2021, as a GOP congressman, Mr. Mullin posted a photo of himself on Instagram saying he was headed home from “helping get Americans out of Afghanistan.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He wrote then: “President Biden and his administration are absolutely lying to the American people about Americans and our friends being left behind.”</p><p>For his part, General Donahue arrived at Kabul international airport on Aug. 18, three days after the Afghan capital fell to the Taliban. In front of him was an impossible puzzle: a sprawling airport besieged by desperate people trying to flee and not enough troops to carry out an orderly end to America’s longest war.</p><p>Days later, on Aug. 26, 2021, a suicide bombing at the airport’s Abbey Gate killed 13 U.S. service members and scores of Afghan civilians. General Donahue was not responsible for that part of the airport when the attack occurred.</p><p>His soldiers from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division held the airport for the final 48 hours of the U.S. mission and managed to evacuate Afghan and American citizens despite limited resources.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>General Donahue was the commander on the ground on Aug. 29 when an American <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/us/politics/drone-civilian-deaths-afghanistan.html" title="">MQ-9 Reaper drone shot a Hellfire missile</a> at a white Toyota Corolla in a neighborhood near the airport.
