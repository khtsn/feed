She voted for former President Donald J. Trump twice, holds more conservative views on border security and is wary of Vice President Kamala Harris’s spending plans.</p><p>But this week — appalled by Mr. Trump’s record of election denialism, worried about women’s rights and disgusted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/trump-msg-rally.html" title="">displays of racism</a> at his recent Madison Square Garden campaign rally — she cast her ballot for Ms. Harris.</p><p>“I felt like I was betraying my party, but country has to come first,” said Ms. Wolfe, who works in municipal government. “Even if our country is not better off in four years because of her policies, in four years, we’re still going to have a country where I have sovereignty over my body, and my ability to be the same level of citizen as somebody who has a different gender.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a politically tribal and closely divided nation with vanishingly few undecided Americans left, Ms. Wolfe is the rarest of rare voters.</p><p>Democrats are betting that she is not alone.</p><p>As Ms. Harris faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/michigan-harris-arab-muslim-jewish-voters.html" title="">alarming</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-young-men.html" title="">signs</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/politics/2024-campaign-las-vegas-nevada-housing.html" title="">erosion</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/us/politics/latinos-trump-harris-poll.html" title="">several</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html" title="">traditionally</a> Democratic groups, her ability to win over a few more Trump-weary moderate or right-leaning Americans like Ms. Wolfe could play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of a razor-tight election. </p><p>“What percentage of them are going to revert to party? Probably most,” acknowledged former Representative Jim Greenwood, a leader of a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/guest-columns/2024/09/04/pennsylvania-republicans-for-harris-trump-greenwood-womble/stories/202409040015" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republicans for Harris</a> effort in Pennsylvania. “But we’re counting on it being the case that enough Republicans, something like 7, 8, 9, percent, will not vote for Trump, but will vote for Kamala Harris.”</p><p>From suburban Philadelphia to upscale Phoenix neighborhoods, interviews with more than 50 voters in critical battleground areas made clear that these voters indeed exist, and tend to be particularly bothered by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" title="">far-reaching abortion bans</a> and the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. </p><p>Ms. Harris, fueled by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/harris-trump-election-gender.html" title="">notable support from women</a>, has a chance to maintain and even expand the advantages Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/06/upshot/suburbs-shifted-left-president.html" title="">have built</a> in such places in the Trump era. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But whether Democrats can capitalize on that opening is far from assured in the face of deep political polarization, widespread <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/economy/inflation-prices-economy.html" title="">concerns about the cost of living</a>, realities of racism and sexism, and the fact that Ms. Harris serves with an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unpopular Democratic president</a>.</p><p>“I want to support her,” said Meredith Smith, a Republican from Phoenix who was still struggling with her decision earlier this week. But, she said, Ms. Harris has not been clear enough about how she would distinguish herself from Mr. Biden.</p><p>“I just wish there were better choices,” she said.</p><h2 id="link-6ed8350c">‘I don’t think she’s as nutty as Trump’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bob Straw supported President Biden in 2020 but has not decided whom he will vote for this year. “I might end up with Harris, I think,” Mr. Straw said. “I don’t think she’s as nutty as Trump is.” </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caroline Gutman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Harris and her allies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/harris-democratic-coalition.html" title="">made persuasion</a> of moderate and even right-leaning voters a central aspect of their closing strategy.</p><p>In the final stretch, Ms. Harris has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/us/politics/harris-liz-cheney-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin.html" title="">campaigned across swing states</a> with former Representative Liz Cheney, the conservative Republican Trump critic. Democrats are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/politics/trump-harris-campaign-ads.html" title="">running ads featuring two-time Trump voters now backing Ms. Harris</a>, an effort to offer a permission structure for voters to change their mind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And the campaign constantly highlights new endorsements from onetime Republican leaders and elected officials alienated by Mr. Trump.</p><p>The point of such messaging is not just to pursue the daunting task of flipping Republicans. Across the battlegrounds, only 5 percent of Republicans in the suburbs say they’re planning to vote for Ms. Harris, according to polling last month from The New York Times and Siena College. Just 10 percent of suburban Republican women view Ms. Harris favorably.</p><p>According to Ms. Harris’s campaign, it is also intended to signal to undecided voters who dislike both parties that Ms. Harris is not a pure partisan. </p><p>“We’re pretty cleareyed about peeling off self-described Republican voters,” said Molly Murphy, a Harris campaign pollster. “Those messages certainly appeal to the handful of anti-Trump Republicans who are still considering their choice in this election, but it is a far bigger swath than just that narrow universe.” </p><p>The message, she said, is both “‘These are conservatives who trust her, and you should, too,’ but also, much more broadly, ‘This is someone who does not play Dem team versus Republican team. This is someone who is willing to bring people together.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Murphy added that the messaging also signals that Ms. Harris “will take the temperature down in this country.”</p><p>In 2020, Mr. Biden campaigned effectively on a unity message, outperforming Hillary Clinton’s 2016 margins in many key swing counties. But not all of those Biden voters are staying in the Democratic tent this election.</p><p>Susan Kondraske, 66, of Doylestown, Pa., is dismayed to know that firsthand. Her husband, who supported Mr. Biden last time, is now backing Mr. Trump, she said in an interview from a manicured outdoor shopping district outside Philadelphia.</p><p>“He doesn’t particularly like Trump, but he believes in the Republican policies,” said Ms. Kondraske, who said she supports both her Republican congressman, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, and Ms. Harris. “It’s a tough subject in my house.”</p><p>Further up the street in Doylestown, Bob Straw, 68, was sparring with his Democratic sister over his choice. As he recalled, he supported Mr. Biden in 2020, but was undecided now. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I kind of like Trump a bit on the military,” Mr. Straw said, even as his sister, who declined to share her name, noted that some of Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/us/politics/trump-administration-criticism.html" title="">former advisers</a> had spoken out against him. “I know he’s aggressive.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Straw said, “I might end up with Harris, I think. I don’t think she’s as nutty as Trump is.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voters lined in Bucks County, Pa., last week.

I never realized everything that Roe versus Wade was protecting,’” she said.</p><p>Sharon Baechtle, 64, of Kintnersville, Pa., said she voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 — “biggest regret of my life” — but backed Mr. Biden in 2020 and would support Ms. Harris this year.</p><p>“Didn’t realize the importance of the Supreme Court,” she said.</p><p>Polling shows that the economy, not abortion, is the most important issue for voters, an issue on which Mr. Trump had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/elections/trump-harris-economy-poll.html" title="">narrowing edge</a> in the latest Times/Siena polling. </p><p>There are also Americans who support abortion rights and are backing Mr. Trump, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/28/upshot/trump-abortion-words.html" title="">tried to soften his rhetoric on abortion</a> in this campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>But in half a dozen conversations with women in purple neighborhoods of Phoenix and surrounding suburbs, most of them self-described moderates, protecting abortion rights and stopping Mr. Trump from pulling the country toward authoritarianism were the two main issues.</p><p>“I’m so outraged, I can’t even sleep,” said Jayne Berkes, 63, a registered Democrat who described herself as politically independent.
