He noted that the ruins had not yet been inspected for damage. On Thursday, Mr. Khodr <a href="https://x.com/BachirKhodr/status/1854450553499091228/photo/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted an image</a> showing the damaged lot adjacent to the ruins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The ruins were designated a protected World Heritage Site in 1984 by the United Nations. Last week, the U.N. agency that designates cultural landmarks said that it was “monitoring the impact of the ongoing conflict on Lebanese cultural sites” and working with Lebanon’s antiquities authority on preservation efforts.</p><p>While the city, near the Syrian border in the Bekaa Valley, was largely spared during the early weeks of the campaign, Israeli <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-evacuation-baalbek.html" title="">military warnings</a> in late October prompted much of its population to flee. Since then, Israel’s military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-evacuation-baalbek.html" title="">repeatedly struck</a> Baalbek.</p><p>The Israeli military also said that it had struck Hezbollah “command centers and terrorist infrastructure sites” near Beirut overnight. Residents reported hearing at least four large airstrikes near the Lebanese capital, with smoke rising over the Dahiya, an area south of Beirut where Hezbollah holds sway.</p><p>One hit so close to Beirut’s international airport that stones fell on a runway, according to local news reports. Lebanon’s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said on Thursday that the airport was operating normally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>More than 3,100 people have been killed in Lebanon since October of last year, most in the weeks since Israel ramped up its campaign against Hezbollah.

It said on Thursday that it was expanding ground operations there to include Beit Lahia, an agricultural area on the Israeli border that has been targeted by repeated airstrikes.</p><p>Separately on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had conducted a strike on a former school that had been run by UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency for Palestinians. The Israeli military said the school was being used by Hamas operatives as a command and control center.</p><p>Ground operations were also continuing in Jabaliya, a large town that has been the focus of the northern offensive. The Palestine Red Crescent Society <a href="https://x.com/PalestineRCS/status/1854558264023036185" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Thursday</a> that an Israeli strike on homes adjacent to one of its locations in Jabaliya killed four people and injured 13.</p><p>The United Nations has warned of a humanitarian crisis that threatens hundreds of thousands of people trapped by the fighting in the north. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency rescue organization, said on Thursday that it had been unable to operate in the north for the last 16 days due to the fighting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The International Rescue Committee said on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-calls-essential-supplies-urgently-enter-northern-gaza-amid-killing-eight-partner" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“intensifying” strikes on hospitals</a> in northern Gaza had “made it almost impossible to deliver lifesaving care,” adding that eight of its medical staff workers had been killed.</p><p>The Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that Israeli military operations had killed at least 78 people in Gaza over the last two days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An ambulance that was part convoy evacuating patients from southern Gaza on Wednesday.

Austin III, on Thursday. Mr. Gallant was abruptly fired by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday, and was viewed by some Biden administration officials as a more reliable interlocutor than the prime minister. The ousted defense minister thanked Mr. Austin and the United States for their “extraordinary support during Israel’s darkest hour.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Polio vaccinations:</strong> The United Nations said it completed the final round of its polio vaccination campaign in Gaza on Wednesday, with about 94 percent of campaign goals reached and more than 556,770 children under the age of 10 getting the needed booster. It called the vaccination rate “a remarkable achievement given the extremely difficult circumstances.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Medical evacuations:</strong> The World Health Organization said on Thursday that it had carried out the largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the war began, with 229 patients and their escorts traveling to Romania and the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients, who left Gaza on Wednesday, included 38 children and 52 adults, including 37 people with cancer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israeli deportations:</strong> Israel’s Parliament passed a law on Wednesday allowing the deportation of close relatives of convicted terrorists if they are believed to have known about an attack in advance without informing the authorities. The law authorizes the Interior Minister to deport those relatives to Gaza or another “specified destination.” The law was condemned as discriminatory by Rawhi Fattouh, a Palestinian leader in the West Bank.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
