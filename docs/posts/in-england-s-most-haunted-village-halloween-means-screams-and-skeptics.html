Ancient enough to feature in the Domesday Book, a survey of landholdings compiled around 1086, its church has seen nine centuries of history. With no street lighting, nighttime here can be distinctly eerie.</p><p>“People prefer old ghost stories,” said Neil Arnold, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Neil-Arnold/author/B005J4U0I4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">several books about haunted Britain</a>. “A ghost story of a guy vaping hasn’t really got the same atmosphere.”</p><p>The villagers in Pluckley have passed the haunted tales down since the early 20th century, embellishing and distorting them along the way, Mr. Arnold said.</p><p>Around half of the stories are rooted in documented incidents — usually murders, grisly deaths or suicides. These include the “screaming man,” whose legend began after a fatal accident at a brickworks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But folklore can be complicated, Mr. Arnold added, describing how he had set out to investigate the origins of the myth that Satan can be summoned by dancing around Pluckley’s “devil’s bush.”</p><p>The dance must be completed backward, 13 times, at midnight under a full moon, Mr. Arnold said, “and you have to be naked, unfortunately.”</p><p>Mr. Arnold has found the bush that the tales refer to, but not in Pluckley, rather, about 10 miles away. The devil, as far as he knows, has yet to appear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A traffic sign in the village offering a warning to visitors. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An actual horse in a field in Pluckley, not one of the phantom ones said to roam the village.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>By the light of day, some of Pluckley’s reputedly scariest spots don’t elicit so much as a shiver, including the bridge where a woman who sold watercress is said to have set fire to herself while smoking a pipe and drinking gin. The nearby spot where a highwayman supposedly suffered a gruesome death is an unremarkable road junction. There is no specific place, frightening or otherwise, to try to spot the phantom coach and horses said to roam the village.</p><p>Pluckley’s ghostly reputation was spread by books like “<a href="https://canterley.co.uk/product/pluckley-was-my-playground/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pluckley Was My Playground</a>,” a memoir written in 1955 by Frederick Sanders, and later by a local broadcaster, Desmond Carrington. Then, a mention by Guinness World Records in 1989 as Britain’s most haunted village consolidated Pluckley’s supernatural status.</p><p>Skeptics include Chris French, an emeritus professor of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, who said the main factors influencing ghost sightings are whether the witness already believed in the supernatural, as well as the context and location.</p><p>“When you’ve got a place like Pluckley,” Professor French said, “with the reputation it has now got, any kind of anomaly, no matter how trivial or how easily explained in other terms, is going to be seen as evidence of a ghost because that’s what people want.”</p><p>Pluckley residents can give firsthand testimony of this phenomenon. Sitting at the bar in the Black Horse, Andy Gooding, 53, who moved to the village in March, recounted waking up one morning to discover that a table placed on a rug was not as he had left it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“The coffee table was upside down with its legs sticking in the air, which panicked me a little,” Mr. Gooding said, instantly assuming this was the work of a Pluckley poltergeist. “It actually turned out it was my partner who had deliberately turned the coffee table the wrong way to get rid of the folds in the rug.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A skeptic about the supernatural, Nick Leggett, an owner of a bed-and-breakfast, admitted to one uncomfortable experience at the property. “I just felt a presence,” he said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dering Woods, known as the “screaming woods,” for the shrieks that are said to be heard there.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At Elvey Farm, a bed-and-breakfast that once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDu1wKXWoZs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">featured in a TV show</a> about the supernatural, the ghost is said to be Edward Brett, who shot himself after falling on hard times.</p><p>Elvey Farm’s current owners, Nick Leggett, 64, and Sonja Johnson, 59, prefer not to exploit that story in their marketing. Still, their guests often confess to being ghost hunters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>A skeptic about the supernatural, Mr. Leggett admitted to one uncomfortable experience in the property’s dark, unlit old house. “I just felt a presence,” he said. “My hair went all up on end; it was a strange experience. I didn’t smell anything, I didn’t see anything, I just felt something.”</p><p>At the Dering Arms, Mr. Buss, who has lived in the area for 40 years, described the hype around ghosts as “generally a load of rubbish.”</p><p>Not all of the customers at the pub’s upscale restaurant have agreed. One refused to use the downstairs bathroom because that meant passing the spot where she once saw a ghost in Victorian shooting dress.</p><p>Mr. Buss is “not a believer” and can explain away 99 percent of odd events, he said, but “every now and then, there is something I can’t,” like mysterious knocks that have awakened him twice in one month.</p><p>Still, he is not afraid to upset any supernatural spirits. “We are supposed to have a ghost in the corner there,” he said, gesturing to an empty space to his right, adding that he recently put the chair she supposedly sat on up for sale in an auction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The moon over Pluckley.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Testa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephen-castle">More about Stephen Castle</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/guinness-world-records">Guinness World Records</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/28/world/europe/pluckley-england-haunted-ghosts-halloween.html">4</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/28/world/europe/pluckley-england-haunted-ghosts-halloween.html">4</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
