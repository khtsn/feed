</span> yesterday and instantly banned the map, to which ZETA responded by removing Abyss from the veto.</p>

<p>Against NRG, it felt as if ZETA were locked out of the game on both maps, but Home Ground&#39;s underdogs entered G2&#39;s map pick of Sunset with a convincing pistol that they were able to convert in the bonus round.</p>

<p>What looked like a potential snowball was immediately shut down by a hospital flick from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> onto <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/34776/absol">
		Absol	</a>
</span>, allowing G2 to put itself on the board and rack up three rounds.</p>


<p><em>What do you even do against that?</em></p>

<p>One timeout resulted in just one more round for ZETA on its attack, as G2 shut down many plays early on off the back of <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2170/babybay">
		BABYBAY	</a>
</span>&#39;s critical operator positioning to end the half up 8-4.</p>

<p>Despite guessing correctly where G2 would end on its attack pistol, ZETA&#39;s B stack could not come out on top, allowing the Americans to reach double digits earlier than they would have liked.</p>

<p>Eager to close out Sunset, G2 stormed B once again and converted its bonus off a <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> 1v1 against <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6668/sugarz3ro">
		SugarZ3ro	</a>
</span>, which brought out <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6717/xqq">
		XQQ	</a>
</span>&#39;s final timeout in response.</p>

<p>Once again, ZETA&#39;s earlier series against NRG felt almost mirrored as its opponents overwhelmed with ease in the second half. An opener from BABYBAY was all G2 needed in Round 17 to capitalize off of and take the series 13-4.</p>

<p>Now one map away from elimination, ZETA entered Split with a nail-biting spike defuse from SugarZ3ro on 7 HP to steal away the pistol. <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span> instantly answered back with a thrifty to even the scoreline and rile up the crowd, setting his team up for an economical advantage.</p>


<p><em>The 2023 world champion.</em></p>

<p>Down 5-1, ZETA looked to its coaching staff for answers once again and were able to convert a thrifty after leaf forgot to plant the spike on an empty A site. SugarZ3ro was able to maneuver through waves of Breach utility to bring ZETA to three, but G2 quickly stabilized.</p>

<p>The American squad won fight after fight, and each G2 player stepped up when needed. A 1v2 clutch from BABYBAY ended the first half in roars from the crowd as G2 cruised along at 9-3.</p>

<p>A final pistol round from G2 prompted a desperate ZETA to force, but to no avail. Utility, positioning, and shots seemed perfect from 2025&#39;s regional kings as ZETA were slowly forced to cede from the tournament 13-3.</p>

<p>Statistics could only tell so much of the story for G2, but each and every player performed exceptionally well to shut down another long run from ZETA.</p>

<p>A North American grand final in New York will poetically play out tomorrow to crown Red Bull Home Ground&#39;s newest champion.</p>
