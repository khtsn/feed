    <h1>Biden’s Cancer Diagnosis</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Questions about Joe Biden’s cancer diagnosis have been among the most searched on the internet since he announced his illness Sunday morning. How could the disease have gone undetected in the former commander in chief, a man with access to the best medical care? Why does the government advise men over 69 not to get annual prostate scans? Does the diagnosis explain Biden’s occasionally doddering affect? Did the White House hide it when he was running for re-election?</p><p>We have (some) answers. For today’s newsletter, I spoke with <strong>Gina Kolata</strong>, a science reporter who writes about diseases and treatments.</p><p><strong>What do we know about Biden’s form of cancer?</strong></p><p>It’s aggressive. The cells have an ugly, disordered appearance under a microscope. Pathologists gave them a Gleason score of 9 (out of 10) for their likelihood to advance quickly. The cancer has already moved from Biden’s prostate to his bones, which means it cannot be cured — only controlled with drugs.</p><p><strong>What about his prognosis?</strong></p><p>Patients with a Stage 4 diagnosis typically live five to 10 years. That’s much better than it would have been just a few years ago. Doctors will likely give him a drug that stops his testes from making testosterone, which fuels the cancer, plus another drug that mops up any testosterone in his bloodstream. He might also get chemotherapy, radiation or other drugs that are specific for his cancer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>President Trump and others have suggested (without evidence) that there might have been a cover-up.</strong></p><p>I don’t have reporting about that. But Biden aides told our colleague Tyler Pager yesterday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/biden-prostate-cancer-psa-test.html" title="">physicians stopped testing Biden’s P.S.A.</a> — his prostate-specific antigen, which surges with cancer — after 2014. The president’s doctors likely didn’t know there was a problem.</p><p><strong>Why didn’t they test him? Isn’t the president one of the most medically scrutinized humans on the planet?</strong></p><p>Guidelines advise that men ages 55 to 69 consider being checked yearly. Biden was already 78 when he entered office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Maryland last year. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>What happens after 70?</strong></p><p>About half of men over that age have <em>some</em> cancer in their prostates but no symptoms. Cancer there grows slowly and usually causes no harm if it’s left alone. If all of these men were screened, the theory goes, many would then be treated with surgery or radiation that wouldn’t prevent their deaths from prostate cancer — and could have devastating side effects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But plenty of men over 70 — including Trump — continue to get regular P.S.A. tests. Which might be reasonable, some doctors say, especially if they are healthy and have a life expectancy of at least 10 more years.</p><p><strong>Biden isn’t just some guy over 70. He was the leader of the free world, and his health was a matter of national interest. Should he have been tested? If he had been, could the cancer have been caught before it metastasized?</strong></p><p>Not necessarily. Dr. Otis Brawley of Johns Hopkins University tells me he has treated about half a dozen men in the last year who had routine P.S.A. results — and then suddenly found metastatic prostate cancer. “How the hell did I get metastatic disease?” he said they ask him. “Whose fault is this?” Some cancers go from nonexistent to metastatic in the year between screening tests. Others don’t even show up on a P.S.A. test.</p><p><strong>Must presidents disclose their health records?</strong></p><p>No. They can tell us — or keep from us — whatever they want to. Trump, for instance, has never released extensive medical files. Biden did, but the paperwork never mentioned a P.S.A. score.</p><p><strong>My grandfather lived for 11 years after a Stage 4 prostate cancer diagnosis. And that was more than 40 years ago. I assume the therapies have come a long way since then. Is Biden likely to die from prostate cancer?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Therapies are totally different now. In the old days, men would have their testicles removed to deprive their tumors of testosterone. Now meds do the trick. Other therapies teach the immune system to fight the cancer or target specific cancer mutations. They don’t just add months to a patient’s life. “We are talking years,” Dr. Judd Moul of Duke University told me. But metastatic cancer remains a fatal disease. Biden will die of prostate cancer unless another condition kills him first.</p><p><strong>Could his cancer explain anything about his speech or cognition during the campaign last year?</strong></p><p>No. The cancer is not in his brain.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-69c6a086">Trump’s Megabill</h2><ul><li><p>Speaker Mike Johnson is closer to unifying House Republicans around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-big-beautiful-bill.html" title="">a bill to deliver Trump’s agenda</a>. </p></li><li><p>Trump met with House Republicans and portrayed the bill as a loyalty test.</p></li><li><p>Chip Roy, a representative from Texas, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/roy-spending-cuts-trump.html" title="">leading the conservative revolt</a> against the legislation.

It was sending novices to Brazil to build their cover identities — to <em>become</em> Brazilian — before deploying them elsewhere. Then, after the Ukraine invasion, more countries began sharing intelligence about Russian agents. That’s when Brazil noticed what was happening.</p><p>My colleague Michael Schwirtz and I got wind of the scheme last year as Brazilian authorities quietly unraveled the operation. Federal agents painstakingly peeled back fake identities, unmasking nine deep-cover Russian spies pretending to be locals. And they turned to Interpol, the international police body, to broadcast details about those operatives — effectively burning them, making it all but impossible for them to work abroad again. The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/world/americas/russia-brazil-spies-deep-cover.html" title="">published our investigation this morning</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>When we landed in Brazil in search of people who had known the spies, we found that they had started businesses, built relationships and fallen in love. When they fled or were arrested, they left behind friends who knew them as completely different people.</p><p>Brazil found them by searching for what they called “ghosts”: people with Brazilian birth certificates who spent their lives without any footprint in the country. They appeared suddenly as adults and began hastily collecting identity documents. One spy had started a jewelry business. Another was a blond, blue-eyed model. A third was admitted into an American university. One, a researcher, had landed work in Norway.</p><p>It’s an odd thing as a reporter, telling people the true identity of their friends. We spent hours with Felipe Martinez, talking about the man he knew as his friend Daniel Wittich. Martinez said Wittich loved 3-D printing and CrossFit. The friends had a joint birthday party, and Martinez showed us a video of Wittich awkwardly blowing out candles. The spy hated having his picture taken.</p><p>When we told Martinez that Wittich was actually a Russian named Artem Shmyrev, he paused, sounded out the unfamiliar syllables a couple of times and shrugged. To him, the spy was just Daniel.</p><h3 id="link-21d9b780"><span><strong>OPINIONS</strong></span></h3><p>As president, Biden had a duty to face the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/opinion/biden-cancer-diagnosis.html" title="">realities of his age, illness and cognitive decline</a>.
