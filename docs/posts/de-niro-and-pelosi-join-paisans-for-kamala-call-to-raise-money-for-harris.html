Tell us a dish!”</p><p>“I guess the closest thing I have is Marty Scorsese’s mother,” Mr. De Niro replied from a neighboring Zoom box. “She makes great pizza. She did. She passed away years ago.” He warned Democrats against complacency — “We know what’s coming, we see it coming”— and then excused himself to attend a Harris fund-raiser with Nancy Pelosi, who popped up in her own Zoom window later in the evening.</p><p>The streamed fund-raiser was the latest of several dozen similar efforts that have raised millions of dollars on behalf of Ms. Harris since the group Win With Black Women hosted the first on July 21. Subsequent events have included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-white-dudes.html" title="">“White Dudes for Harris”</a> (featuring the actor Jeff Bridges, in character as the Dude from “The Big Lebowski”), “Cooking for Kamala” (hosted by Padma Lakshmi and featuring celebrity chefs like José Andrés and Giada de Laurentiis), “Deadheads for Kamala” (Ben and Jerry, inevitably), and many more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The events are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/how-2024-became-the-zoom-election.html" title="">a very post-pandemic spin on the small-donor fund-raising</a> that powered the campaigns of Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders in recent cycles, a sort of telethon adapted to the technologies Americans learned to know and tolerate during years of remote work and school. (On Sunday night’s stream, both Leon Panetta, the former secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A., and Steve Buscemi, the actor, struggled briefly with the mute button.)</p><p>The relative ease of participating, as well as Democrats’ sense of urgency around the election, have meant that even small groups have assembled significant wattage for their calls. Besides Mr. De Niro and Mr. Buscemi, Sunday night’s stream featured Marisa Tomei, John Turturro, Mark Ruffalo and Lorraine Bracco.</p><p>“It’s a much cheaper format, to just put together a group of people who might be interesting and fun to watch on Zoom, and have people come in and go, ‘Hey, I want to give $5 to this,’” said Lisa Ann Walter, the comedian and actor on the ABC sitcom “Abbott Elementary,” who appeared on Sunday’s Zoom.</p><p>As the events have lost their novelty, they have lost some of their fund-raising potency. The first few drew millions of dollars each, but more recent efforts have fallen far short of that.</p><p>The “Paisans for Kamala” event was billed as a virtual red-sauce Sunday family dinner. Some of the participants took the dinner theme more literally than others, including Mr. De Blasio, who defiantly ate a slice of pizza onscreen with a fork and a knife to the performative outrage of Tim Ryan, the former Ohio congressman.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When Ms. Pelosi appeared in her own Zoom window later in the evening, the emcee, the comedian Paul Mecurio, commended her for standing up to Mr. Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. “That’s an Italian right there,” he said.</p><p>“An Italian grandmother,” Ms. Pelosi said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
