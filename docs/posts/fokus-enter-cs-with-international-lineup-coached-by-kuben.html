                  <p>Rounding out the roster are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/24332/matheos" data-tooltip-id="uid433488523">Mateo <span>&#34;⁠Matheos⁠&#34;</span> Prišlin</a>, who played alongside <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/24203/jorko" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid680383259">Jorko</a> on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/4548/cph-wolves" data-tooltip-id="uid268104034">CPH Wolves</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20625/banjo" data-tooltip-id="uid1475761785">Matias <span>&#34;⁠Banjo⁠&#34;</span> Kivistö</a>, who most recently played for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12960/fire-flux" data-tooltip-id="uid81004514">Fire Flux</a>.</p>
                  <p>The project marks <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/162/kuben" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid381259287">kuben</a>&#39;s return to activity after nearly 18 months on the sidelines following his August 2024 benching by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/4869/ence" data-tooltip-id="uid1877405804">ENCE</a>.</p>
                  <p>&#34;During this time, I was quietly waiting for the right moment to return to work,&#34; the Polish coach told HLTV. &#34;However, I have the impression that being benched in a tier-2 team makes some team owners think I&#39;m not competent enough.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Fortunately, there are those who do in-depth research, invite me for an interview, and only then open their eyes to the values I follow when taking over or building a team from scratch. This is exactly what happened with FOKUS, who waited a long time to enter the CS2 scene, and after several hours of conversations, we decided we wanted to work together.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I have only positive feelings about the roster. We interviewed many players. Once we decided to go international, we had a plan of how to build it correctly, by getting a great mixture of players who have played big events and Majors in the past, as well as players who have an extremely high ceiling but have not yet played in a more professional environment.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Erik [ztr] and I have known each other for some time as he tried out for Apeks over three years ago when I was looking for a new IGL to complete the lineup. I knew he was definitely the person we should get if that option arose. He has grown so much over that time, and it seems like we both understand CS the same way. So far, it’s been a pleasure working together.&#34;</p>

                  <p>FOKUS&#39; unveiling of an international lineup signals a major shift in their initial plans for the scene.</p>
                  <p>In November, FOKUS completed the signing of ESC&#39;s lineup, a Polish lineup ranked 42nd in the world at the time. The team even attended two DraculaN events and Urban Riga Open Season 2 under the name <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13547/friendly-campers" data-tooltip-id="uid1910213353">Friendly Campers</a> with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/162/kuben" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid381259287">kuben</a> as the coach. But in the end, FOKUS decided to go in a different direction.</p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/43212/esc-bid-farewell-to-cs-team">

                  <p>&#34;Over the course of two months and at several LANs, they had the chance to prove themselves before being announced as FOKUS players in early 2026,&#34; Max &#34;Eggo&#34; Eickhoff, Senior Team and Project Manager at FOKUS, told HLTV. &#34;However, it became apparent relatively early on that this roster wasn&#39;t working, so we trusted the coaches and started building from scratch again.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We have been working for many years to finally see FOKUS in Counter-Strike, and it is important to us to do it in a way that we can identify with.</p>
                  <p>&#34;The players in question are therefore under contract with the company in the background, but are not an active or official part of FOKUS. We are working with them and their agents to resolve this situation as quickly as possible. We will not stand in the players&#39; way and will seek solutions so that they can continue their careers as quickly as possible.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We are currently discussing various scenarios, including one in which another organization takes over the core, which is equipped with some great VRS points, or even the full team.&#34;</p>
