Today, 96 hostages in Gaza have been held for nearly the same amount of time. As the American White House changes hands, I implore President Biden and President-elect Trump not to forget about them.</p><p>Among the hostages are two young children: Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who were just 4 years old and 9 months old when they were kidnapped from the south of Israel along with more than 240 others, including an estimated 40 other children. I know the filth, the fear, the torture they endure because one year ago, I was one of them.</p><p>On Oct. 7, 2023, my 9-year-old son, Ohad, and I were visiting my parents in Kibbutz Nir Oz. We woke to sirens shortly after 6 a.m.</p><p>From television and WhatsApp groups, we learned the terrorists were near. I started to panic. I told Ohad to turn off the TV and get under the bed. I heard the sound of machine guns. We turned off the lights and locked the front door. My parents joined us in the safe room; it had no lock.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Then we heard the terrorists’ voices. My father, who walked with a cane, tried to hold the safe-room door shut. Suddenly, there were five armed men with us in the room. They took our mobile phones and led us outside. There I saw a line of cars was on fire; terrorists were driving golf carts filled with looted possessions. It was chaos.</p><p>Our captors put Ohad, my mother and me in a golf cart. My father had fallen as we left the house. He was still on the ground as we were driven away.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
