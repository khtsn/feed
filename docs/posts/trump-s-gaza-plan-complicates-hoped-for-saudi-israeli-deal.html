name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump touted the 2020 Abraham Accords that established formal ties between Israel and four Arab countries as one of the biggest foreign policy achievements of his first term.</p><p>Now he is pursuing his long-desired goal of getting Saudi Arabia to join the accords — but he may have just dealt himself a serious setback. Mr. Trump’s proposal to transfer all two million Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and then rebuild the enclave as the “Riviera of the Middle East” has antagonized some of the very people he needs to seal the deal.</p><p>The Gaza idea was swiftly rejected by Arab countries, among them Saudi Arabia. The Gulf powerhouse released a pre-dawn statement right after Mr. Trump floated the proposal on Tuesday evening alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in Washington.</p><p>The kingdom made clear that it is standing by its demand that a Palestinian state first be established before it will normalize relations with Israel. The precondition, which the Saudis have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/saudi-arabia-palestine-trump-gaza.html" title="">insisted on</a> for the past year, is “nonnegotiable and not subject to compromises,” the Foreign Ministry said in <a href="https://x.com/KSAmofaEN/status/1886953044484473007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> on Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The statement directly contradicted Mr. Trump, who had just told reporters in Washington that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/llp6xBPX2pk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia had dropped the precondition</a>. One senior Saudi royal said what the American leader was proposing would be tantamount to an “ethnic cleansing” of Gaza.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians have been returning to the devastated north of Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By proposing to “clean out” Gaza, Mr. Trump has earned little but suspicion and anger in Arab countries. Efforts by the American administration to soften the stance, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggesting that Gazans would be relocated only temporarily, have done little to mollify them.</p><p>The issue of Palestinian statehood is at the heart of the controversy over Mr. Trump’s Gaza proposal. For many Arabs, displacing Palestinians is anathema because it would shred their hopes for an independent state.</p><p>Egypt and Jordan, the countries Mr. Trump has suggested could be persuaded to take in Gazans, have publicly remained adamant that they would never accept a mass displacement of Palestinians. Officials, journalists and analysts in both countries said history spoke for itself: When Palestinians have been forced from their homes, they have not been allowed back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Since the war in Gaza, both countries have been taking in Palestinians in need of medical attention. Egypt has accepted at least 100,000 medical evacuees and others who fled the neighboring enclave. Jordan, much of whose population is of Palestinian descent, is treating dozens of injured people from Gaza.</p><p>But participating in any forcible or permanent displacement of Palestinians from Gaza would be “morally and legally horrifying,” said Abdel Monem Saied Aly, a pro-government Egyptian political analyst and columnist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators in Egypt last month, protesting previous comments by Mr. Trump in which he suggested moving Palestinians out of Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kerolos Salah/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Given the Saudi population’s broad support for the Palestinians, it would be difficult for the government to accept any agreement that does not address their aspirations for statehood. Public outrage in the kingdom over the war, and now over Mr. Trump’s proposal to empty Gaza, has complicated the prospects of a deal with Israel that was already going to be difficult to pull off.</p><p>Before Mr. Trump took office for his second term, there was some cause for modest optimism that Saudi-Israel normalization might move forward. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire.html" title="">cease-fire</a> between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas was reached on the eve of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. And the new American president has for years fostered a good working relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But now, some strains seem to be emerging in that relationship.</p><p>Prince Turki al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia’s former spy chief and former ambassador to the United States, told CNN on Wednesday that Mr. Trump “will get an earful from the leadership here” not only about the lack of wisdom in what he is proposing but also the injustice of “ethnic cleansing.”</p><p>As if to underscore his point, he wore a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/style/kaffiyeh-palestine-israel-hamas-war.html" title="">Palestinian black-and-white checked kaffiyeh</a> in lieu of his traditional white headdress.</p><p>The four Arab governments that signed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-israel-united-arab-emirates-uae.html" title="">Abraham Accords</a> — the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan — did so despite criticisms that they were giving up on what had for decades been the Arab precondition for any ties with Israel, the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Waiting to sign the Abraham Accords at the White House in 2020.

Period,” Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was quoted as saying by Israel’s army radio last month.</p><p>The Saudis sat out the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/world/middleeast/bahrain-israel.html" title="">historic signing</a> of the Abraham Accords, but when the deal expanded to include Morocco and Sudan, the Saudi crown prince called Israel a <a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/617738" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“potential ally”</a> in a 2022 interview with The Atlantic.</p><p>In September 2023, the crown prince became the first leader of the kingdom to openly discuss the possibility of establishing relations with Israel in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/us/politics/saudi-arabia-israel-united-states.html" title="">exchange for a defense pact</a> with the United States and help with developing a civilian nuclear program. He did not mention Palestinian statehood as a condition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In an interview with Fox News at that time, the crown prince said such an agreement would require “a good life for the Palestinians.” The indications back then pointed to the possibility that Saudi Arabia, too, might be willing to scale back its insistence on a Palestinian state before forging ties with Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A billboard depicting Mr. Trump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia in Israel on Tuesday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Then came the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. The 15-month Israeli military campaign that followed killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The war devastated the densely populated and impoverished territory.</p><p>Since the war, the Saudi government has shifted its tone, saying that the region needs to be on an irreversible path to statehood for the Palestinians.</p><p>“We do have some red lines,” Prince Khalid bin Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the United Kingdom, said late last month. “And for us to end the last 75 years of pain and suffering caused by one problem has to include a Palestinian state.”</p><p>It is possible that both Mr. Trump and the Saudi leadership are laying out maximalist positions as starting points in a negotiation, and will shift at some point to reach a compromise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Many people in the four countries that normalized ties with Israel have been horrified by the war in Gaza and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-war-bahrain.html" title="">publicly protested</a> the accord.
