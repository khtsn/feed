He has said that Israel has a right to defend itself, although he has from time to time publicly expressed some of his frustration with Mr. Netanyahu. Privately, the president <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/stop-bullshitting-me-biden-said-to-scold-netanyahu-in-call-on-truce-hostage-deal/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has reacted far more explosively</a>, sometimes with expletives, to Israel’s moves, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/biden-reportedly-fed-up-with-netanyahu-calls-him-asshole-over-conduct-of-gaza-war/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as multiple news reports have indicated</a>.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu and the president last <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/21/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-call-with-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-8/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke on Aug. 21</a>, according to a White House statement.</p><p>Mr. Woodward’s book, obtained by The New York Times and other news outlets on Tuesday, adds additional, inside-the-room details to those previous accounts, including direct quotes from Mr. Biden speaking with his staff or with the prime minister.</p><p>In April, for instance, the president questioned Mr. Netanyahu’s conduct in the war in a phone call, asking, according to the book, “What’s your strategy, man?”</p><p>When Mr. Netanyahu insisted that the Israeli military needed to push deeper into southern Gaza and invade the southern city of Rafah, a key border crossing with Egypt, the president, using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname, dismissed this response.</p><p>“Bibi, you’ve got no strategy,” Mr. Biden replied, according to Mr. Woodward.</p><p>In May, Mr. Biden halted a shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel out of concern that they would be used in the Rafah operation and cause excessive civilian casualties. After Mr. Netanyahu proceeded with the invasion of Rafah anyway, Mr. Biden told advisers that Mr. Netanyahu was a liar, using an obscenity, and added that “18 out of 19 people who work for him” were also liars, the book says.</p><p>He questioned Mr. Netanyahu’s motivations, saying that “he doesn’t give” a damn about Hamas but gives a damn “only about himself,” although he used an earthier term than “damn.”</p><p>Mr. Biden has also occasionally expressed his irritation with Mr. Netanyahu directly with the prime minister as the relationship has frayed.</p><p>“Bibi, what the fuck?” the president yelled at Mr. Netanyahu in July, the book says, after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/beirut-explosion-hezbollah-stronghold-intl-latam/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an Israeli airstrike</a> killed a top Hezbollah military commander, Fuad Shukr, and several civilians in an airstrike near Beirut and an Israeli bomb killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political leader, during a visit to Iran.</p><p>“You know the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor,” Mr. Biden told him, the book reports.</p><p>“This is Haniyeh,” Mr. Netanyahu replied, according to the book, “one of the leading terrorists. A terrible guy. We saw an opportunity and took it.”</p><p>Now, as efforts at a cease-fire in Gaza have all but collapsed, the war has reached the one-year mark and conflicts with other Iranian proxy groups like Hezbollah have escalated, threatening to draw Iran directly into the conflict. Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu are facing a situation not unlike one they have faced in the recent past.</p><p>In April, Israel conducted a strike in Syria that killed a top general in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, and Iran responded with a salvo of about 300 ballistic missiles, rockets and drones at Israel. The United States and its allies helped intercept most of the projectiles and, as The New York Times has previously reported, Mr. Biden urged Mr. Netanyahu not to respond, telling him to “do nothing” and “take the win.”</p><p>But Israel launched a limited, calibrated strike against Iran in response, and Mr. Biden told his advisers he had anticipated as much. “I know he’s going to do something but the way I limit it is tell him to ‘do nothing,’” he said, according to Mr. Woodward.</p><p>That statement may foretell what lies ahead in the fraught relationship. Last week, Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in what it said was retaliation for the Israeli assassinations of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader; Mr. Haniyeh; and a commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.</p><p>Mr. Biden has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-weapons-biden-israel.html" title="">warned Israel against striking Iranian nuclear sites</a>, saying any response should be “in proportion.” But based on the recent past, the president may not expect Mr. Netanyahu to take U.S. advice.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
