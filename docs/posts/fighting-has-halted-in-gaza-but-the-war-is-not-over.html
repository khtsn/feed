And yet, as a cease-fire took hold on Sunday after 15 months of massive destruction and death, Hamas — badly wounded and diminished — has survived and, at least for now, will remain in charge in Gaza.</p><p>Thousands of Hamas fighters have already re-emerged from hiding and fanned out to reestablish control.</p><p>“In blunt terms, Hamas are not only still standing, but they remain the most significant force in Gaza,” said Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator and president of the U.S./Middle East Project, a research organization based in London and New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The situation underlines the fragility of a deal reached with Mr. Netanyahu, who is facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-cease-fire.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">tremendous political pressure</a> at home. It also comes as Donald J. Trump is set to become president again amid great uncertainty over how he plans to deal with a landscape in the Middle East that is much altered since his first term.</p><p>And the war is not over. The three-phase cease-fire deal, largely unchanged from a plan President Biden announced eight months ago, is extremely fragile, as evidenced by the tension-filled delay in starting it on Sunday morning. There will be 16 days before talks are expected to begin on the second phase.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
