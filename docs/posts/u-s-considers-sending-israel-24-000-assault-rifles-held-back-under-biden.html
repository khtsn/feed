    <h1>U.S. Considers Sending Israel 24,000 Assault Rifles Held Back Under Biden</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the time, Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right Israeli politician, was the minister of national security. He has supported the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and the annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel. Some Democratic lawmakers were concerned that his police forces would use the American weapons to support settlers engaged in violence against Palestinians, which has become increasingly common in recent years, or to carry out acts of violence themselves.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Gvir said in October 2023 that he would give arms to settlements and create civilian militias for the protection of settlers.</p><p>When asked then about concerns about how the rifles would be used, a State Department official said the weapons would go only to “I.N.P.-controlled units,” referring to the Israeli National Police. But the official, Jessica Lewis, who runs the bureau in charge of arms transfers, did not define such units.</p><p>Mr. Ben-Gvir and his party recently left the government to protest a new series of Israeli-Palestinian prisoner swaps.</p><p>In December 2023, Democratic lawmakers informally approved the order of rifles on the condition that Israel provide proper assurances for their use, said the U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive weapons orders. Lawmakers then continued to express concerns to Mr. Blinken, who eventually ordered the rifles held.</p></div></div>
