At least 37 people were killed and more than 2,900 others injured in those explosions on Tuesday and yesterday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/here-is-the-latest-on-the-attacks-in-lebanon?smid=url-share" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>In his televised speech, the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said, “Indeed, we have endured a severe and cruel blow.” He also warned that Israel would “face just retribution and a bitter reckoning.”</p><p>Shortly after he spoke, the Israeli military carried out more than 70 airstrikes across southern Lebanon, according to three senior Lebanese security officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions, but a dozen current and former defense and intelligence officials who were briefed on the attack involving pagers on Tuesday said the Israelis were behind it.</p><p><strong>An elaborate ruse</strong>: The operation was complex and long in the making, according to the officials. Israel established a shell company posing as an international pager producer which began shipping to Lebanon in the summer of 2022.
