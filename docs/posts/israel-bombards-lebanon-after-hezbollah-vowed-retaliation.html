At least 37 people were killed and more than 2,900 others injured in those explosions on Tuesday and yesterday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/here-is-the-latest-on-the-attacks-in-lebanon?smid=url-share" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>In his televised speech, the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said, “Indeed, we have endured a severe and cruel blow.” He also warned that Israel would “face just retribution and a bitter reckoning.”</p><p>Shortly after he spoke, the Israeli military carried out more than 70 airstrikes across southern Lebanon, according to three senior Lebanese security officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions, but a dozen current and former defense and intelligence officials who were briefed on the attack involving pagers on Tuesday said the Israelis were behind it.</p><p><strong>An elaborate ruse</strong>: The operation was complex and long in the making, according to the officials. Israel established a shell company posing as an international pager producer which began shipping to Lebanon in the summer of 2022. These pagers contained batteries laced with an explosive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" title="">Read the full story behind the Israeli operation</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephanie Keith/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-37769c16">The stock market hit a record high </h2><p>The S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/business/stock-market-federal-reserve.html" title="">rose 1.7 percent today</a> after the Fed’s big cut to interest rates sparked a global market rally, crossing above its last closing record, reached in mid-July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Stocks had been butting up against the high for the past two weeks, after recovering from a round of turmoil in late July and early August.
