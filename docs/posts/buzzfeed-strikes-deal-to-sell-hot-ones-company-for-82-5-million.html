Mythical Entertainment, the media company created by the YouTube stars Rhett and Link, is also an investor.</p><p>The deal will allow BuzzFeed to pay down tens of millions of dollars in debt that was scheduled to come due this month. The company is reducing its debt load of nearly $124 million by $88.8 million, using proceeds from the sale and funding from its operations, leaving the company with more cash than debt on its books.</p><p>The deal is also a new chapter for the company behind “Hot Ones,” a show in which Mr. Evans stoically interviews celebrities while they eat progressively hotter chicken wings. Scarlett Johansson, Megan Thee Stallion, Sydney Sweeney, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele have all appeared as guests. Campaign officials for Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wanted her to go on the show</a>, but First We Feast demurred, saying that “Hot Ones” didn’t want to delve into politics, an adviser to Ms. Harris, Stephanie Cutter, said during an interview last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The sale unwinds the vestiges of a deal, struck three years ago, to acquire Complex, a rival company that owned First We Feast and is known for its coverage of pop culture. The deal helped BuzzFeed go public, but the company’s stock has since fallen, as investors grew increasingly bearish on digital media.</p><p>BuzzFeed has since pared back its investment in expensive original content, telling investors that it is focusing on using technology such as artificial intelligence to create and deliver content to users. The company shuttered its news division in 2023, and this year, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/business/buzzfeed-complex-sale.html" title="">sold</a> Complex for $108.6 million, though it held onto First We Feast.</p><p>Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed, said in a statement that selling “Hot Ones” would help BuzzFeed transform into “a media company positioned to fully benefit from the ongoing A.I. revolution.”</p><p>The deal is another high-profile investment for Soros Fund Management, which has backed media and entertainment companies in recent years. In 2022, the firm, founded by the billionaire George Soros, invested an undisclosed sum in Crooked Media, the company created by the former Obama administration staff members behind the podcast “Pod Save America.”</p><p>First We Feast, which has more than 14 million subscribers on YouTube, will be led by its existing team and continue to publish episodes of “Hot Ones” without major changes. The company is planning to use its investment from the consortium of investors to create new shows and strike deals with other creators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I’m excited to continue hosting ‘the show with hot questions, and even hotter wings’ for years to come,” Mr. Evans, who will become chief creative officer of First We Feast, said in a statement. “The future is spicy, and I can’t wait to see what’s next.”</p></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Media Industry</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Onion:</strong> A judge said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/business/media/the-onion-infowars-alex-jones.html">not approve the sale of Infowars</a>, the website founded by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to the satirical publication, prolonging a messy tug of war between two high-profile suitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fox News and News Corp.:</strong> A Nevada commissioner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/media/rupert-lachlan-murdoch-family-trust.html">ruled against Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to change his family’s trust</a> to consolidate his eldest son’s control of his media empire and lock in Fox News’s right-wing editorial slant, according to a sealed court document.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Observer:</strong> Shortly after a 48-hour strike by journalists ended, the Guardian Media Group said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/guardian-observer-sale.html">struck a deal to sell The Observer</a>, the U.K.’s oldest Sunday paper, to the digital start-up Tortoise Media.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Los Angeles Times:</strong> Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the newspaper’s billionaire owner, said that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/media/la-times-owner-bias-meter.html">planned to introduce a “bias meter”</a> next to the paper’s news and opinion coverage as part of his campaign to overhaul the publication.</p></li><li><p><strong>DirecTV:</strong> The company is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/dealbook/directv-dish-network-deal-collapse.html">calling off its plans to acquire the rival satellite TV giant, Dish Network</a>, after Dish’s lenders refused to agree to the terms of the deal.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
