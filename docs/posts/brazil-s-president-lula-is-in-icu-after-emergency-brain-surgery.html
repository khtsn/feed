He has said he received several stitches to close a wound on the back of his head from the Oct. 19 fall and had been undergoing periodic M.R.I. exams to check for signs of bleeding.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Doctors advised him to stop traveling by plane after the incident, so he canceled trips to Russia and Azerbaijan for<span>  </span>conferences in October and November.</p><p>“I’m taking preventive medicine.
