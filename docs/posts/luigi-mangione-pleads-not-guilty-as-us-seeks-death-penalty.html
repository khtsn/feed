Trucks with his image circled around.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Inside the packed courtroom, Judge Garnett directed prosecutors to convey her caution against public commentary to the interim U.S. attorney, Jay Clayton, and asked that he pass on the message to Ms. Bondi “and any of her subordinates at Main Justice.”</p><p>Mr. Mangione’s lawyers had already complained about Ms. Bondi’s public statements. On April 1, even before he was indicted, Ms. Bondi said that the government would pursue the death penalty to carry out Mr. Trump’s agenda.</p><p>A few days later, in an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” she again discussed the decision, saying, “The president’s directive was very clear: We are to seek the death penalty when possible.”</p><p>Judge Garnett’s caution Friday came at Mr. Mangione’s arraignment in Manhattan federal court, where he was indicted on April 17 on a charge of using a firearm to commit murder, for which he could receive the death penalty if he is convicted.</p><p>Asked by the judge how he pleaded to the four-count indictment, Mr. Mangione said, “Not guilty.” He was dressed in jail garb and seated with his lawyers at the defense table. He appeared attentive, consulting quietly with his legal team and at least once appearing to write in a notepad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The case stems from the early morning shooting of Brian Thompson, 50, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare on Dec. 4.</p><p>The killing occurred outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel where Mr. Thompson’s firm was hosting an investors conference. The authorities say that Mr. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland family, was masked and armed with a 9-millimeter, 3D-printed ghost gun equipped with a silencer when he approached Mr. Thompson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some supporters of Mr. Mangione waited for hours to gain entry to his hearing in Manhattan federal court.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Mangione was arrested on Dec. 9 at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., where the authorities said he was found with a handwritten manifesto condemning the American health care system.</p><p>Two discharged shell casings found at the scene of the killing had the words “DENY” and “DEPOSE” written on them, and “DELAY” was written on a bullet also found there, the authorities have said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In addition to the federal charges, Mr. Mangione has been indicted by the office of Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, on a count of first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, which carries a potential life prison sentence. Mr. Mangione has also pleaded not guilty to the state charges.</p><p>Federal prosecutors on Friday filed legal papers giving formal notice that the government was seeking the death penalty against Mr. Mangione, and listing factors supporting their decision.</p><p>They said that the killing was intentional and involved substantial planning and premeditation, and that Mr. Mangione posed a “future danger because he expressed intent to target an entire industry, and rally political and social opposition to that industry, by engaging in an act of lethal violence.”</p><p>They also said that he had fled New York to evade law enforcement immediately after the murder.</p><p>Mr. Mangione’s lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo told Judge Garnett that Mr. Mangione’s phone conversations with his lawyers had been inadvertently recorded in jail and provided to the U.S. attorney’s office. She said she was told the recordings would not be shared with the prosecutors in federal and state court involved in Mr. Mangione’s case. The judge asked the government to look into the matter and provide her an update by May 2.</p><p>As the process ground forward methodically in court, the events outside were more informal.</p><p>John McIntosh, 43, had been in line since 7:30 p.m. Thursday. He was fifth and he was hawking his seat: “For only $350, it’s yours,” he said loudly, waiting for someone to bite.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The name “Luigi” seemed to be on everyone’s tongues. People swapped stories about their connections to him, however tenuous — a friend might have played against him in lacrosse; someone went to a party years earlier that he might have attended.</p><p>Sandra Ministro, 33, a software engineer who traveled from New Jersey Friday morning to attend the arraignment, said, “I think everyone does truly deserve health care.”</p><p>She carried a piece of white poster board with the words “Healthcare is a human right,” “Lives over profit” and “Free Luigi” scrawled in colorful marker.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>April 25, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article described incorrectly when Luigi Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania. It was Dec. 9, not April 9.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>20</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Suspect in the Slaying Of a Health-Care Chief Offers a Not Guilty Plea<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
