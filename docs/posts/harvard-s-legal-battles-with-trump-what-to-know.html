Burroughs, an appointee of President Barack Obama, is presiding over both cases. She has often sided with Harvard, including on June 5 when she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/harvard-response-trump-international-students.html" title="">issued a temporary restraining order</a> against the administration’s latest move to bar international students.</p><p>On both fronts, the Trump administration has said that it is punishing Harvard because it has failed to keep Jewish students safe by allowing antisemitism to flourish. It has added on to these accusations as the court fights have drawn on, saying that the university has used racial preferences in admissions in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling and that it has broken rules related to foreign gifts.</p><p>Harvard has denied the accusations. It says the administration is ignoring its efforts to protect the civil rights of its Jewish students, for example. And Harvard has argued that the federal government has violated its First Amendment rights and has ignored due process as it pursues its vendetta against the university.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what to know about the two court battles.</p><h2 id="link-72172212">One lawsuit is focused on international students.</h2><p>In May, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html" title="">said that it would halt</a> Harvard’s ability to enroll international students, an announcement that prompted fear across higher education. Current students must transfer or lose their legal status, Kristi Noem, the U.S. homeland security secretary, wrote in a letter to the university.</p><p>About 5,000 international students are currently enrolled at Harvard, and an additional 2,000 recent graduates are in the United States on visas permitting them to remain temporarily after graduation to work.</p><p>Harvard immediately sued. Judge Burroughs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/harvard-sues-trump-international-students-garber.html" title="">issued a temporary restraining order</a> against the federal order, agreeing that Harvard demonstrated the move would cause “immediate and irreparable injury.”</p><p>On June 4, the Trump administration escalated its attack, this time with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-student-visas.html" title="">decree from the president himself</a>. Mr. Trump ordered that effective immediately, any foreign national who tried to enroll at Harvard would be barred from entering the United States.</p><p>Judge Burroughs issued another temporary restraining order blocking the move. She also extended the previous temporary restraining order against Ms. Noem’s directive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h3 id="link-7f9e4ac8"><span><strong>Current status</strong></span></h3><p>The judge has scheduled a June 16 hearing to discuss a longer-term block to the administration’s actions, known as a preliminary injunction, which would prevent enforcement of the federal orders as the case works its way through the courts.</p><h2 id="link-8d334ff">Another lawsuit is focused on federal funding.</h2><p>Before the Trump administration targeted Harvard’s ability to enroll international students, it started gutting its research enterprise.</p><p>In April, the university sent Harvard a list of intrusive demands that would have reshaped aspects of the university that it holds dear, including how it chooses its faculty and students.</p><p>The university <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">rejected the demands</a> on April 14, setting off the extraordinary two-month battle. The Trump administration retaliated that night by announcing it would be terminating more than $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to the university.</p><p>Harvard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/harvard-lawsuit-trump-administration.html" title="">sued the next week</a>, arguing that the administration did not take the necessary steps before canceling federal funds and that it was using “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>From April 14 to May 6, the university received seven stop-work orders for research awards. The orders then ramped up, and 950 followed, totaling $2.4 billion, the university wrote in court documents that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/harvard-argues-cutting-off-its-government-funding-is-wasteful.html" title="">painted a dark picture</a> for research at Harvard if the Trump administration prevailed.</p><p>The government began terminating federal funding to Harvard on May 5, starting a 120-day clock, the university wrote in court documents. On June 2, the university filed a motion requesting summary judgment, or a quick victory, no later than early September, arguing that time was critical.</p><p>“Once that closeout occurs, Harvard anticipates the government will take the position that no restoration of funds is possible,” the university wrote.</p><h3 id="link-7f9e4ac8"><span><strong>Current status</strong></span></h3><p>The two sides will meet in person for the first time in this case in a hearing scheduled for July 21.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vimal Patel writes about higher education with a focus on speech and campus culture.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
