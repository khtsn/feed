But that rally stalled in recent weeks as anxiety about the inflationary impact of new tariffs began to grow. A slump in technology stocks this week also weighed on the broad market.</p><p>The pullback was driven, in part, by renewed concerns about the inflationary effects of sweeping tariffs, which Mr. Trump has already imposed on China and has said he will broaden to Canada and Mexico next week. As recently as late 2024, investors had expected the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates several times this year, moves that would be positive for stocks and the economy, but that view has shifted quickly amid concerns that inflation will linger longer than expected. With rates set to remain elevated, worries have extended to the broader impact on the economy.</p><p>Recent economic surveys showing a sharp <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/trump-tariffs-spending-cuts-economy.html" title="">decline</a> in consumer sentiment, in part because of pessimism about employment prospects, as well as expectations that prices could start to climb again, have fueled caution among investors too.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The market had shown great enthusiasm around the election, and it was predicated on the likelihood of favorable taxation, of a lighter regulatory climate, and just general enthusiasm,” said Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “The problem is, those expectations got a bit ahead of the reality.”</p><p>Here’s what else to know about the recent retreat:</p><ul><li><p>Concerns about the economic outlook have been evident in other markets too. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.24 percent on Friday, its lowest level since December. Oil prices also fell on Friday, with Brent crude down more than 1 percent to just over $73 a barrel and trading close to its lowest levels since late 2024.</p></li><li><p>Excitement about prospects for artificial intelligence had fueled a rally in tech stocks over the past year, but investors’ expectations may have stretched too far. The chipmaker Nvidia released quarterly results on Wednesday that exceeded analysts’ expectations but still left investors wanting more. Nvidia’s stock dropped more than 9 percent this week, dragging down the tech-heavy Nasdaq.</p></li><li><p>The Nasdaq is about 3.8 percent lower for the month, in what would be its biggest monthly decline since last April.</p></li><li><p>Tesla was a standout in February, falling nearly 30 percent for the month after a 14 percent decline this week. This week’s losses were in part a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/tesla-stock-elon-musk-trump.html" title="">reaction</a> to a steep decline in Tesla’s European sales. More broadly, the company, led by Elon Musk, last month reported a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html#:~:text=Increased%20competition%20and%20Tesla&#39;s%20relative,slightly%20less%20than%20in%202023." title="">sharp drop</a> in profit for 2024. Mr. Musk’s role in the Trump administration is also giving investors pause about his priorities.</p></li><li><p>A slide in cryptocurrencies is also weighing on stocks. Bitcoin, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/technology/bitcoin-price-record.html#:~:text=It%20has%20turned%20out%20to,those%20pizzas%20today%3A%20%241%20billion." title="">rose</a> to a milestone $100,000 in December, has fallen more than 20 percent from its high last month and is trading closer to $80,000. The drop has come even though the Trump administration has ushered in a lighter regulatory approach on cryptocurrencies, and as Bitcoin has fallen so have shares of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/business/bitcoin-crypto-company-treasury.html#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20sharp%20pivot,rather%20than%20chasing%20higher%20returns.&amp;text=David%20Yaffe%2DBellany%20reports%20on,financial%20markets%20from%20New%20York." title="">companies with exposure to it like Coinbase and MicroStrategy</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Despite major stocks weighing on overall indexes this week, some analysts remained bullish about the long-term outlook, noting that the S&amp;P 500 remains near a record high — and the mood on Wall Street is far from set in stone. Investor sentiment could “change on a dime,” Mr. Sosnick said.</p><p>How long Mr. Trump’s economic policies will weigh on the stock market remains to be seen.</p><p>“It’s certainly possible that stocks experience some additional policy-driven downside risk in the near term,” said David Lefkowitz, head of equities for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. “But ultimately, we don’t think the Trump administration will take measures that have long lasting negative impacts on economic growth or inflation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-reserve-the-fed">Federal Reserve (The Fed)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tariffs and Oil Companies:</strong> The cost of steel pipe used to line oil and gas wells rose after President Trump said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/energy-environment/trump-oil-steel-tariffs.html">impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Competing Goals:</strong> The president has promised big results, from raising revenue to reviving domestic manufacturing. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/economy/trump-tariff-goals-contradictions.html">But many of his goals undermine one another</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Alaska Gas Project:</strong> As President Trump pressures countries to buy more American energy, Asian officials and investors are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/trump-tariffs-alaska-lng-japan.html">reconsidering the $44 billion plan that has been stalled for decades</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Tariffs on Copper?:</strong> Trump signed an executive order directing his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to begin an investigation into whether foreign production of copper and imports of the material into the United States pose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-tariffs-copper.html">risks to America’s economic and national security</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Crackdown on China:</strong> A close look at Trump’s recent decisions shows that he is considering a wide set of economic restrictions on Beijing, ones that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/trump-china-crackdown.html">could hasten America’s split from a critical trading partner</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
