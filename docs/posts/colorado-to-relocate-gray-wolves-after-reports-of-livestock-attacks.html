That a pack was formed and three pups were born within the first year of the program was an incredible feat, and that’s why he’s concerned that relocating the pack could harm the wolves.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“There’s some good scientific evidence that breaking up a pack, especially removing the leader, can lead to the dissolution of the group,” he said, warning against trapping the wolves individually and then releasing them into a new home in the wild.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At this early stage, any intrusion on the “integrity of the pack could be really damaging,” he said. If they must be relocated, it has to happen as a group — a difficult task.</p><p>Dr. Bekoff called the Copper Creek pack “the promise for the future of Colorado wolves,” and he said he was dismayed that it was already potentially being derailed by human intervention.</p><p>“My concern is that the wolves haven’t had time to adapt, habituate,” he said. “People might disagree with me, but this is really a sign that maybe Colorado isn’t ready for wolves<em>.”</em></p></div></div></section></article></div>
