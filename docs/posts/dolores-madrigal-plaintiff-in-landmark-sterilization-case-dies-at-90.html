She was 90.</p><p>The death, at a hospice facility, was confirmed by her son Oren Madrigal.</p><p>Ms. Madrigal was among several hundred Spanish-speaking women who said they were pressured into signing consent forms — written in English — agreeing to have their fallopian tubes tied during cesarean section deliveries. Ten of them filed a federal class action lawsuit against the Los Angeles County-U.S.C. Medical Center in 1975.</p><p>The sterilizations occurred amid political hysteria about overpopulation: In 1970, President Richard M. Nixon had established the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/17/archives/nixon-signs-bill-creating-commission-on-population.html" title="">Commission on Population Growth and the American Future</a>, led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/11/archives/john-d-rockefeller-3d-philanthropist-72-aided-arts-and-population.html" title="">John D. Rockefeller III</a>. The plaintiffs argued that the hospital, which received state and federal funding for family planning programs, was trying to lower the birthrate of Mexican American women — a charge hospital administrators and medical staff denied.</p><p>After a bench trial in 1978, Judge <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/curtis-jesse-william-jr" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jesse W. Curtis Jr.</a> of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ruled against the plaintiffs, writing in his decision that their “ability to understand and speak English is limited,” that the case was “essentially the result of a breakdown in communications” and that “one can hardly blame the doctors.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Ms. Madrigal’s experience showed otherwise, her attorneys had argued, and ultimately led to state and national reforms, including mandatory waiting periods for the procedure, known as tubal ligation, for women in labor, and requirements that doctors provide patients with consent forms in their native language.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The coerced sterilizations brought news coverage and protests by women.

A nurse came into her room offering an extra procedure that could be done during her delivery.</p><p>“She told me that if I wanted to be taken care of so I would not have any more children, and that for them not to come as often because this child had come too fast after the one I had had first,” Ms. Madrigal testified. “I said, ‘no,’ that my husband did not want to.”</p><p>Other nurses and doctors came into the room, each asking the same question. At least one member of the medical staff spoke to her in Spanish.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“They would be around my bed,” Ms. Madrigal testified. “I didn’t even know what to do.”</p><p>The doctors and nurses then spoke separately to Ms. Madrigal’s husband, telling him that if his wife had another child she would die. In a panic, she testified, he agreed to the tubal ligation.</p><p>Ten minutes later, a nurse returned to Ms. Madrigal’s bedside and said, “Your husband said yes.” According to Ms. Madrigal, the nurse, who was laughing, threw the consent form at her, telling her to write “no más hijos por vida” — no more children for life — alongside her signature.</p><p>Ms. Madrigal, in the throes of labor, said she could not understand what the form said.</p><p>“I was very sick,” she testified. “I felt the pains. I was very frightened, also.”</p><p>She delivered her baby, but had no idea that doctors had sterilized her.</p><p>Around the same time, Dr. Bernard Rosenfeld, a resident in the obstetrics unit, began providing copies of documents about the sterilizations to newspapers and public interest groups, eliciting outrage in the Latin community.</p><p>In 1974, Ms. Madrigal was listening to the radio when a news report aired about women protesting at the hospital about the sterilizations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I thought that perhaps they had done the same, to sterilize me, as they were saying,” she testified, “and that I wanted to find out.”</p><p>Ms. Madrigal went back to the hospital the next day. An examination by a doctor confirmed her fear — she had been sterilized. She left in tears.</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep, just thinking of the papers that had been thrown at me, and it would come to me at night,” she testified. “Very sad. I couldn’t believe what they had done to me, because I know I didn’t need that operation because I felt perfectly well.”</p><p>She joined the lawsuit brought by Charles Nabarrete and Antonia Hernández, lawyers at the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice.</p><p>Despite losing in court, the case became a cause célèbre in the reproductive rights movement. A 2015 documentary about the women, <a href="https://www.nomasbebesmovie.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“No Más Bebés,”</a> was directed by Renee Tajima-Peña and produced by <a href="https://irle.ucla.edu/portfolio-item/virginia-espino/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Virginia Espino</a>, a professor at U.C.L.A. who wrote her dissertation about the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I like to call them the Madrigal 10,” Professor Espino said in an interview. “I would like for them to be seen for their courage and not for the abuse that took place.”</p><p>She added: “And it doesn’t matter that they lost because they brought this issue out into the public.”</p><p>Dolores Nuñez Arriola was born on April 8, 1934, in the town of Villa Purificación in Jalisco State, Mexico.</p><p>She moved to the United States in 1965 and eventually settled in the Los Angeles area, taking night school classes to learn basic English. In 1971, she married Orencio Madrigal, a mechanic. Ms. Madrigal worked as a teacher’s aide.</p><p>After the Madrigals learned about the tubal ligation, their household became unstable. Mr. Madrigal became an alcoholic. Both of their sons, Oren and Sergio, joined gangs. They survive her, along with a sister, Antonia Nuñez, and four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1994. Ms. Madrigal moved to Las Vegas several years ago to live with Oren.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>For decades, the couple kept the sterilization a secret. Oren learned about it as an adult, when producers for the documentary contacted him while trying to reach his mother for an interview.</p><p>“She was dealing with my father, her kids getting in trouble, and at the same time she had her own trauma — this injustice,” Oren said in an interview. “We never really knew that. But she turned to God, to her Catholic faith.”</p><p>In 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors issued an apology to the women who had undergone coerced sterilizations. Four years later, the hospital installed a <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/southern-california/human-interest/2022/08/18/art-piece-at-la-county-usc-medical-center-tells--dark-past--of-sterilizations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">circular monument</a> in a quiet garden to honor them.</p><p>“Yo, por dentro, siento mucha tristeza,” reads a quote on the wall surrounding the monument. “Se me acabó la canción.”</p><p>The translation: “I feel very sad inside. The song has ended for me.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
