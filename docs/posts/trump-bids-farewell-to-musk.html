    <h1>Trump Bids Farewell to Musk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump welcomed television cameras into the Oval Office this afternoon for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/trump-elon-musk.html" title="">a goodbye event for Elon Musk</a>, the billionaire whose short time in Washington was both exceptional and turbulent.</p><p>Musk, after years of drifting to the political right, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get Trump elected. He then wielded enormous power from an unpaid advisory role, traveling with the president and attending meetings with foreign leaders. Musk’s central effort in Washington was aimed at gutting the government bureaucracy. He often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">inflated the results of his cost-saving measures</a> and never came close to his goal of $1 trillion in cuts, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/federal-workers-musk-doge.html" title="">his chain-saw approach to cutting spending will be lasting</a>. Workers were fired, contracts were canceled and programs were eliminated.</p><p>Ultimately, Musk’s departure — which he attributed to the end of the 130-day legal limit for “special government employees” — came as his influence inside the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-doge.html" title="">appeared to be waning</a>. He has faced friction with the president, with whom he has clashed on tariffs and budget issues.</p><p>Still, Trump heaped praise today on Musk, describing him as “one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.” He gave Musk a golden key emblazoned with the White House insignia and said he would remain an adviser.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Musk, too, vowed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/politics/musk-washington-efficiency-departure.html" title="">not to fully leave Trump’s orbit</a>. He told Trump’s advisers this year that he would give $100 million to political groups controlled by the president’s team before the 2026 midterm elections.</p><p>Musk showed up to today’s event <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/elon-musk-black-eye.html" title="">with a black eye</a>. He said that his 5-year-old son had punched him when the two were “horsing around.”</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>My colleagues reported today that during Musk’s time on the campaign trail last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/elon-musk-drugs-children-trump.html" title="">he used drugs far more intensely than previously known</a> and faced increasing family turmoil. Musk brushed off questions about the article during his White House farewell.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A port in Shanghai this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-fc3cfcd">Trump accused China of violating a trade truce</h2><p>Trump said today that Beijing was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html" title="">not honoring the terms of a trade truce</a> that the U.S. and China brokered this month, which temporarily rolled back tariffs that the countries had imposed on each other.
