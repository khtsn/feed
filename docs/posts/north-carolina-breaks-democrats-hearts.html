How much hope they invested in my state. How many reasons they found to argue that Vice President Kamala Harris could emerge victorious, succeeding where every Democratic presidential candidate this century — with the sole exception of Barack Obama in 2008 — had failed.</p><p>By all indications and reports, the Democratic turnout effort here was not only better staffed and better organized, by far, than the Republican one, but it was also, according to prominent North Carolina Democrats and seasoned political analysts, superior to anything that any Democratic presidential nominee put together in North Carolina in the past. And the state’s brisk population growth since 2020, when Joe Biden lost the state to Donald Trump by only about 1.3 percentage points, favored Harris, making the state’s metropolitan areas bigger and turning them bluer.</p><p>But in this fiercely contested and potentially prophetic battleground, that wasn’t enough. After several furious months of nonstop television commercials, countless yard signs, door knocking galore, cold calling ad nauseam and incessant, traffic-snarling visits from the candidates themselves, Harris came up short. Donald Trump came out on top.</p><p>And that will be examined as closely as the outcomes in any of the other major battleground states, because for the entirety of this agonizing election season, North Carolina functioned as a national mood ring and mirror, vividly reflecting all the relevant 2024 dynamics and every major plotline.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For those of us who live here, Trump’s victory didn’t simply answer the question of who’d get our state’s juicy trove of 16 electoral votes and, with them, draw closer to winning the presidency. It concluded a political melodrama of the highest and tensest order.</p><p>“I’ve never seen people as anxious,” former Representative David Price, a North Carolina Democrat who spent more than a quarter-century in the House, told me. He said that while North Carolinians are used to swing state intensity, “this time has been different. This is no holds barred.”</p><p>Although Harris and her supporters had ample cause for optimism about North Carolina, Trump and his supporters arguably had more. It has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5155130/support-from-rural-democrats-will-be-crucial-for-harris-to-win-this-swing-state" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more rural voters than any of the other six major battleground states</a>, meaning that Harris’s fortunes hinged on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/opinion/north-carolina-democrats-win.html" title="">chipping away at Republicans’ enormous advantage in what is undeniably Trump country</a>.</p><p>“We have a lot of people who are just baked in for Trump,” Representative Kathy Manning, a North Carolina Democrat who decided not to run for re-election after the state’s Republican lawmakers redrew her district, told me when we spoke late Tuesday morning. She called herself “cautiously optimistic” about a Harris victory in the state, but she also noted what a stiff challenge Harris faced, especially with the third of the state’s voters who aren’t registered as either Republican or Democratic. They’d have been more likely to choose Harris, Manning said, “if we’d had more time to get out there and let those unaffiliated voters know who she is and what motivates her and what her plans are.” As it was, Harris’s entire presidential campaign spanned just 15 weeks.</p><p>She came to North Carolina in many of them. She and Trump didn’t so much sweet-talk as stalk us, all the way to the finish. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/02/nx-s1-5176564/2024-election-trump-harris-nc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">She dropped in on Saturday, as did he — twice</a>. He came back on Sunday. And again on Monday, on the off chance we’d forgotten him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Did that make the difference? Impossible to know.</p><p>But some dimensions of the presidential race in North Carolina are clearer than before. There are, it turns out, limits to what a turnout operation can do. The formidability of Harris’s was described in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/30/harris-campaign-north-carolina-october-surprise/?utm_campaign=wp_follow_dana_milbank&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_danamilbank&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3f78506%2F67221ec7f4ba5a5e73f4c2c4%2F596aa254ae7e8a0ef3414b6c%2F8%2F26%2F67221ec7f4ba5a5e73f4c2c4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent column</a> in The Washington Post by Dana Milbank, who counted 360 paid staff members, 29 field offices, 40,000 volunteers and, in one week, more than 100,000 door knocks and more than 1.8 million phone calls.</p><p>Milbank wasn’t the only one impressed with it. Representative Deborah Ross, a North Carolina Democrat who coasted to re-election Tuesday on predominantly Democratic turf, told me during a conversation late Tuesday afternoon that when she visited polling stations in the red patches of her district earlier in the day, there were many more Democratic volunteers making Harris pitches than there were Republican ones trumpeting Trump. “It’s astounding to me,” she said.</p><p>And it was heartening, she said, as was her acquaintance with many North Carolina Republicans who publicly repudiated Trump and announced their intentions to vote for Harris as a way of preventing his return to the White House.</p><p>But, she added, Trump was assiduously promoting “messages of fear” that might well resonate “with people who have not fully recovered from the pandemic, who have economic insecurity.” I lost count of the number of times I saw a Trump ad that used an apocalyptic tone and sinister images to emphasize Harris’s support for transgender inmates. He consistently and constantly cast Harris as some lefty lunatic, a portrayal crafted for a Southern state like North Carolina.</p><p>Many Democrats had predicted that Harris would benefit significantly in North Carolina from the votes of women angry about the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, especially given the state’s high-profile governor’s race, in which the Republican nominee, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, faced a withering ad campaign spotlighting his past support for an abortion ban with no exceptions. Several of the commercials run by Robinson’s Democratic opponent, North Carolina’s attorney general, Josh Stein, used portions of a past statement of Robinson’s in which he insisted that abortion was “about killing a child because you weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down or your pants up — and not get pregnant by your own choice — because you felt like getting your groove thing on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Robinson’s history of extremist positions and viciously bigoted comments made him the apotheosis of MAGA fury and a test case for a swing state’s tolerance for that even before <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a CNN report</a> in mid-September that he had frequented a porn site where he identified himself as a “black NAZI!” and celebrated slavery. Although he denied that and later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/mark-robinson-cnn-porn-lawsuit.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> against CNN, many of the people working on his campaign quit, and many Republicans outside North Carolina effectively gave up on him.</p><p>Would that hobble Trump, who early this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/opinion/trump-mark-robinson-north-carolina.html" title="">called Robinson “better than Martin Luther King”</a> but over the past month and a half <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/trump-mark-robinson.html" title="">pretended that Robinson never existed</a>? That question occupied the thoughts of many political analysts, because even if a sizable group of North Carolina Republicans or Republican-leaning independents were comfortable with a Trump-Stein ticket split, a percentage of them might be so demoralized and disgusted by the Robinson fiasco that they just didn’t bother to vote — or so the thinking went.</p><p>Though Stein handily defeated Robinson — by what looked to be a margin of more than 15 percentage points — Robinson didn’t drag down Trump. North Carolina voters, known for splitting their tickets in the past, did so to an even greater extent this time around.</p><p>“North Carolina, like this country, is a complex place.” Damon Circosta, who served as the chair of the North Carolina State Board of Elections from 2019 to 2023, told me in a text message shortly after Trump was declared the victor here. “Next year, North Carolinians will have to do what we have always done — find a way to live among one another, work alongside of each other and make sense of the fact that none of us are as easily categorized as it may seem.”</p><p>Was Trump actually helped by the lies that he told and the distrust that he sowed after Hurricane Helene ripped through western North Carolina, causing catastrophic damage? That will — and should — be a focus of post-mortems on the presidential race here. He and many other prominent Republicans made all sorts of charges and promoted all manner of conspiracy theories about government officials targeting or ignoring Helene’s victims, and those grievances had so much traction — which any quick perusal of social media scarily demonstrated — that even a few Republican politicians in North Carolina spoke up and spoke out to tell people to disregard that nonsense. It was a noble attempt at cleanup, but the mess had already been made.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Harris was up against that and against a general dissatisfaction among Americans — North Carolinians included — with the direction of the country and the state of the economy. While she tried at times and in ways to present herself as the candidate of change, her past four years as Biden’s governing partner made that a difficult sell.</p><p>When I spoke with Price, the former congressman, over the weekend, he said that he thought Harris had a good shot. But he also recognized how often Democrats had branded North Carolina the “New South,” only to have it cling to its old ways, and how frequently their pronouncements of its dawning progressivism had been contradicted.</p><p>“Ever since forever, we’ve thought that one of these days, things are going to tip around here,” Price said. “But we’re always falling short.”</p><p>He also wondered if Trump’s onstage meltdowns over the final week of his campaign would matter as much to voters in North Carolina and elsewhere as they did to the media. ”I see this endgame stuff going on — the Madison Square Garden thing, the fantasizing about Liz Cheney, this craziness, a lot of it related to women — and I honestly don’t know if it penetrates,” he said. “So many things have happened that didn’t penetrate.”</p><p>That’s the story of a national race that often seemed strangely impervious to developments that promised to have greater effect than they ultimately did. And of a state — my state — reverting to type when there were so many reasons it shouldn’t.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Frank Bruni is a professor of journalism and public policy at Duke University, the author of the book “The Age of Grievance” and a contributing Opinion writer.
