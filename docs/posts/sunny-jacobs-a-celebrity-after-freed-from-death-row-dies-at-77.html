She was 77.</p><p>Her death was <a href="https://sunnycenter.org/2025/06/03/with-deep-sadness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> by the <a href="https://sunnycenter.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sunny Center</a>, an anti-death penalty nonprofit organization founded by Ms. Jacobs, with locations in Galway and Tampa, Fla. It said she had “passed away after a fire at the Sunny Healing Center.” The circumstances of the fire were not immediately clear.</p><p>Ms. Jacobs spent nearly 17 years in prison in Florida, five of them on death row, for the murders of two law enforcement officers in February 1976 at a rest stop near Fort Lauderdale.</p><p>Her boyfriend at the time, Jesse Tafero, a petty criminal who had been convicted of attempted rape, was also convicted of murder. He was executed by electric chair in Florida in a notoriously botched procedure in May 1990. It took seven minutes and three jolts, and his head caught on fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Jacobs, whose death sentence was overturned in 1982, was ultimately freed a decade later, when a federal appeals court found that prosecutors had improperly withheld evidence from the defense. She took a plea deal rather than face retrial and was never legally exonerated.</p><p>It was this story that formed the basis of Ms. Jacobs’s subsequent, celebrated tale — that she had been an innocent, a “28-year-old vegetarian hippie,” as she told The New York Times in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/fashion/weddings/sunny-jacobs-and-peter-pringle-vows.html" title="">a 2011 Vows article</a> about her marriage to a fellow former inmate, the Irishman Peter Pringle, who died in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Jacobs and Peter Pringle at their wedding in 2011.

Responsibility for them, she said, lay with another passenger in the car, Walter Rhodes, who had also been convicted of petty crimes and who later confessed to the killings of the two officers (though he subsequently recanted, confessed and recanted again, multiple times).</p><p>Ms. Jacobs’ 9-year-old son, Eric, and a baby daughter were also in the car, and they were left motherless by what she claimed was her unjust incarceration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Her story was retold in theater and on film. Off Broadway, Mia Farrow, Jill Clayburgh, Lynn Redgrave, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/theater/reviews/the-exonerated-revived-at-the-culture-project.html" title="">Stockard Channing,</a> Susan Sarandon, Brooke Shields and others have all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/movies/theater-review-someone-else-committed-their-crimes.html" title="">portrayed</a> her in “The Exonerated,” a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/13/theater/true-stories-of-injustice-drawing-some-big-names.html" title="">2000 play</a> by Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen. It became a Court TV movie in 2005 starring Ms. Sarandon. Ms. Jacobs’s story was also the basis of an earlier TV movie, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116622/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“In the Blink of an Eye”</a> (1996).</p><p>Barbara Walters once devoted a sympathetic segment to Ms. Jacobs on the ABC News program “20/20.” And Ms. Shields, along with the actresses Marlo Thomas and Amy Irving, attended Ms. Jacobs’s wedding to Mr. Pringle, in New York, at which Ms. Shields wept and said: “Despite everything they have been through, they are not bitter or jaded. They never closed their hearts.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stockard Channing portrayed Ms. Jacobs in a 2012 Off Broadway production of “The Exonerated,” a critically acclaimed play about wrongfully convicted survivors of death row.

She published her findings in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/haunted-by-a-grisly-execution-an-investigator-decides-to-dig-deeper/2021/03/04/f3db33e2-6d47-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well-received</a> 2021 book, “Two Truths and a Lie.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. McGarrahan’s meticulous, incisive research — she left journalism to become a professional private investigator after witnessing the execution — contradicts Ms. Jacobs’s story on almost every point.</p><p>Ms. Jacobs, Mr. Tafero and Mr. Rhodes existed in a murky underworld of violence, drug dealing, gun infatuation and petty crime, Ms. McGarrahan found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Miami Herald reporter Ellen McGarrahan spent 30 years digging into what actually happened that day at the rest stop, publishing her findings in her well-received 2021 book.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Random House</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>By the time of the fatal encounter with the Florida state trooper Phillip Black and his visiting friend, the Canadian constable Donald Irwin, Ms. Jacobs’s charge sheet was already long: arrests for prostitution, forgery, illegal gun possession, contributing to the delinquency of a minor (her then-4-year-old son, Eric), and drug dealing.</p><p>After the killings, a loaded handgun was found in her purse. Several weapons — two 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns, a .38-caliber Special revolver, a .22-caliber Derringer, a .32-caliber revolver — were found in the various cars linked to Mr. Tafero and Mr. Rhodes, Ms. McGarrahan wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Two eyewitnesses, truckers who were at the scene of the killings, said in court testimony that Mr. Rhodes couldn’t have been the shooter because they saw that his hands were in the air. Forensic evidence suggested that a Taser shot, setting off the volley of fatal gunfire between the two parties, came from the back of the car, where Ms. Jacobs was sitting with her children.</p><p>Ms. McGarrahan posits that Ms. Jacobs may have at least fired the Taser, which she had purchased months earlier.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jesse Tafero, 30, and Ms. Jacobs, 28, in January 1977.

I don’t think that’s knowable.”</p><p>Sonia Jacobs — who was also known as Sonia Leigh Linder, Sonia Lee Jacobs and Sonia Lee Jacobs Linder, according to Ms. McGarrahan — was born on Aug. 24, 1947, in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens. Her parents, Herbert and Bella Jacobs, owned a textile firm. Sunny, as she was known, grew up in Elmont, N.Y., on Long Island.</p><p>She dropped out of college in 1965 and got married, with a wedding reception at the Tavern on the Green restaurant in Manhattan, Ms. McGarrahan wrote. By 1968 — the state of her marriage at that point is unclear — she was living with her young son in Miami in a house owned by her parents. Her life, before and after meeting Mr. Tafero, was “drugs, drugs and more drugs,” one informant told Ms. McGarrahan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>In 1982, after the Florida Supreme Court had overturned Ms. Jacobs’s death sentence and commuted it to life in prison, her parents were killed in a Pan Am plane crash in New Orleans.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Jacobs in 2011.
