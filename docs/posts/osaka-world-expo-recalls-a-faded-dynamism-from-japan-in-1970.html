    <h1>Osaka World Expo Recalls a Faded Dynamism From Japan in 1970</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When Osaka first hosted the World Expo in 1970, a quarter-century after World War II, Japan’s economy was newly affluent and expanding so rapidly it was hailed as an economic miracle. The Expo broadcast that momentum to the world.</p><p>It was the first World Expo — a tradition dating to 1851 where countries gather to show off their cultures and achievements — to be held in Asia. Japan spent lavishly, displaying innovations like moving walkways, prototype cordless phones and a 230-foot sculpture with a gold mask said to be looking toward the future. The Expo drew 64 million visitors — equivalent to over half the population of Japan at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-1"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Foreign dignitaries visiting the 1970 World Expo.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Albert Riethausen/picture-alliance, via dpa, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visitors got around via moving sidewalks, a futuristic innovation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mario De Biasi/Mondadori Portfolio, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now, 55 years later, Osaka is hosting the World Expo again. On an artificial island in the city’s bay, architects have erected a mile-long wooden ring encircling dozens of pavilions. But while the current Expo, which opened a week ago, seeks to recapture the fervor of its predecessor, Japan stands in stark contrast to where it was in 1970.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since the bursting of Japan’s real estate and stock bubbles in the early 1990s, the economy has stagnated. The country’s population is shrinking and rapidly aging. Debt levels have ballooned and prospects for growth are being further <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/nissan-kanda-japan-factory.html" title="">imperiled</a> by escalating trade tensions with the United States.</p><p>When thinking back to the decades since the 1970 Expo, many visitors to the original event, now in their 60s or older, allude to a feeling of Japan’s economic might having “sunk” in a world increasingly roiled by trade divisions. Some hope the current Expo may prove to be a moment of national reinvention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two people walk near a massive wooden structure." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-01-tkfw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/48302af4-d849-5a3e-aadb-7b15c2fa3179" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An intricate and massive wooden ring encircles the 2025 Expo site.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The new Expo is built on an artificial island off Osaka.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Expo ’70 Commemorative Park, site of the earlier event in Osaka, is known for its cherry blossoms.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In a quiet neighborhood in Osaka, a few rail stops away from the 2025 Osaka Expo site, Takahiro Moritaka, 65, runs a small restaurant serving savory Japanese pancakes that he flips on a griddle behind the counter.

That’s despite Expo advertisements scattered throughout Japan’s train stations and a late-blooming national love for the event’s mascot, a red and blue, globular ring-shaped creature named Myaku-Myaku.</p><p>The Expo organizers have said they want to attract more than 28 million visitors over the six months the event will continue. But ticket sales have lagged well behind that target. The Expo has also been criticized as a waste of taxpayer money, with costs surging about $1 billion above original projections.</p><p>More recently, an even darker shadow was cast over the event by President Trump, who, a few days before the Expo’s open, announced double-digit percentage tariffs on many of the countries participating in the gathering. That included a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods that Japan’s prime minister called a “national crisis.”</p><p>Hiroki Ogasawara, a professor of intercultural studies at Kobe University, said that escalating trade hostilities would probably continue to dominate global attention in the coming months and color the way the Expo is remembered. “What is the world currently focused on? Trump’s tariffs,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>With regard to the Expo, Mr. Ogasawara said, “It may only be Japan that is paying attention.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, at the Expo’s opening ceremony earlier this month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Myaku-Myaku, mascot for the 2025 Expo, draws a crowd.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Netherlands Pavilion aglow.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-29"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/19/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-video-diptych2-cover-zwgj/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-video-diptych2-cover-zwgj-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/19/multimedia/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-video-diptych2-cover-zwgj/BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-video-diptych2-cover-zwgj-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/19/137966_1_BIZ-JAPAN-EXPO-video-diptych2_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">An outdoor fountain display, left, and an interactive video installation at this year’s Expo.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inside the United States Pavilion at Expo 2025, which recalled the country’s flights into space.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Early on Monday, the day after the Expo’s opening, Eiko Nakanishi, 49, and her father, Masao Nakanishi, 77, made a beeline to the American pavilion.
