The blaze quickly escalated to five-alarm level (which indicates the fire’s high degree of severity), drawing personnel and equipment from multiple agencies.</p><p>“As you might imagine, with an advanced fire condition, heavy smoke conditions in a building of this size, with known quantities of people trapped, when our members got here, they were far, far, far outmatched with those initial responding companies,” the chief said.</p><p>The identities and the ages of the victims were not immediately available. Four people were taken to a hospital in critical condition, Chief Lipski said.</p><p>The Milwaukee Fire and Police Departments are investigating the cause of the fire. The state fire marshal has also been called to help.</p><p>Chief Lipski said that the blaze had started in a common area of the building and not inside a unit, but it had then moved “to involve multiple floors and multiple other apartments.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The fire has rendered the building, which had 85 units, uninhabitable; a couple hundred people have been displaced. Chief Lipski said that the American Red Cross was helping those affected.</p><p>“Absolutely a horrible way to begin Mother’s Day here,” he said.</p><p>Chief Lipski noted that the building, which was constructed in 1968, did not have a sprinkler system or standpipes installed. He said that a building built before 1974 “of certain size, shape, dimension, occupancy” was not required to have sprinklers.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Johnny Diaz is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news from Miami.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
