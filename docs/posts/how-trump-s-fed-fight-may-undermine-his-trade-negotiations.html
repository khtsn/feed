The individual and institutional price we lawyers will have to pay, and the sacrifices we will have to make, to hold the line against this aggression may be enormous, but I view them as commitments we made when we became lawyers. I believe we either pay the price and fight or we forfeit our license and moral right to practice law.</p><p>True, some have fiduciary duties to their law firms in the face of an arguably existential threat. But I believe we have a prior, and more fundamental, fiduciary duty to society to defend the rule of law, which itself faces an existential threat. There are no lawyers or law firms, and no duties owed to them, if an autocratic regime succeeds in stripping the legal profession of its independence. In my view, the deals now being cut are only emboldening that regime and further empowering it as, literally day by day, it gains more ground. I do not believe I can carry on at the firm knowing that I am now, in a sense, a party to one of these deals.</p></blockquote><p>Howard declined to comment.
