    <h1>Hurricane Milton Began Thrashing Florida’s West Coast</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Heavy winds and intense rain from Hurricane Milton’s outer bands lashed Florida’s Gulf Coast and flooded its beaches today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/09/us/hurricane-milton-florida" title="">as the Category 3 storm neared landfall</a>. Tornado warnings blanketed the Florida peninsula.</p><p>“The storm seemed to arrive all at once late in the morning, bringing bands of thick rain and whipping wind,” my colleague Patricia Mazzei, who reported today from Sarasota, told me.</p><p>Milton is expected to make landfall around midnight and carve a path of destruction across the center of the state. About 5.5 million people faced evacuation orders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Forecasters cautioned that predicting its exact landfall was not yet possible, though the current projections have the storm heading toward Sarasota, which has not had a direct hit from a hurricane since 1946. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/weather/milton-map-path-tracker.html" title="">Here’s the latest look at Milton’s anticipated path</a>, and the probability different Florida cities will see damaging winds.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Experts warned that the most dangerous effect of the hurricane could be its storm surge, which could reach up to 15 feet in low-lying communities along more than 70 miles of Florida’s western coastline. Even farther inland, forecasters warned that water levels could surge to eight feet above ground. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/08/weather/hurricane-milton-storm-surge.html" title="">This map shows where the worst flooding is expected</a>.</p><p>With 51 of 67 counties in Florida under a state of emergency, the Panhandle was likely the only region that would be spared any effects — a daunting prospect even for a state used to extreme weather. Patricia talked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/hurricane-milton-sarasota-residents.html" title="">Floridians who decided to stay put</a>.</p><p>“The memories of Hurricane Helene’s damaging storm surge two weeks ago still seem fresh, so many people appear to have evacuated,” Patricia told me. “It was striking to see barrier islands and coastal communities so empty.”</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>Take a look at photos and videos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/hurricane-milton-photos-videos.html" title="">from Florida as Milton approached</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Valaurian Waller for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-280f5547">Harris raised more than $1 billion since entering the race</h2><p>Kamala Harris, who launched her bid for president less than three months ago, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/harris-billion-dollar-fundraising.html" title="">already raised more than $1 billion</a>, according to people with knowledge of her fund-raising. No other candidate is believed to have ever raised so much money so fast. For comparison, Donald Trump has raised around $853 million so far this year.</p><p>By far the most amount of money is being spent in Pennsylvania, which is considered by both campaigns to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/trump-harris-pennsylvania-battleground.html" title="">the state most likely to tip the election</a>. Harris has more than 400 staff members on payroll in the state across 50 offices, and her team said that they knocked on 100,000 doors last Saturday.</p><h2 id="link-4291416d">On the campaign trail</h2><p><em>The presidential election is </em><strong><em>27 days away.</em></strong><em> </em></p><ul><li><p>Trump has so far opted out of the planning for a government handover, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/trump-presidential-transition.html" title="">skirting ethics and fund-raising rules</a>.</p></li><li><p>Resistance to public health, once considered fringe, now has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/medical-freedom-public-health-rfk-trump.html" title="">firm foothold in Republican politics</a>.</p></li><li><p>The election is vexing Wall Street. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/business/wall-street-trump-harris-election.html" title="">Here’s why</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the White House in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3f13d4da">Netanyahu and Biden spoke after many weeks of silence</h2><p>President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel.html" title="">spoke today over the phone for the first time since August</a>, their offices said. Details of the call were not available, but the lack of communication between the two leaders reflected their souring relationship, as Netanyahu rejects Biden’s calls for de-escalation.</p><p>The call came after Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, delayed a visit to the U.S., where he had been expected to discuss a response to Iran’s missile attack. Gallant, who has closely worked with U.S. officials in recent weeks, said Netanyahu told him to postpone the trip.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong>New images <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/world/middleeast/lebanon-destruction.html" title="">showed the destruction in Lebanon</a> along its border with Israel.

But there’s no smoking gun.</p><p>More important, perhaps, the film argues that the identity of the creator, known online as Satoshi Nakamoto, actually matters — in part because Nakamoto may control an estimated $60 billion in Bitcoin.
