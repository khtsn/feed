Their father, Robert Kyle Burns Jr., an anthropologist, was mentally ill.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As his mother’s cancer metastasized, Ken overheard conversations — his mother pleading with relatives, asking for someone, <em>anyone</em>, to take her boys in the event of her death. “I remember being scared — scared all the time,” he said.</p><p>With their mother in the hospital, the boys were left to wait at home for the inevitable. On the night of April 28, 1965, Ken went to bed with one of the worst stomachaches he had ever had — his body registering what none of the adults would speak about.</p><p>The pain disappeared suddenly. The phone rang. His mother was gone.</p><p>On a cul-de-sac, the Burns family — once four, now three — sank into the darkness of Robert’s mind. He bought a fish tank. Then he bought another, and another, until their dining room was lined with 13 tanks teeming with tropical fish, said Ric Burns, now 69, who is also a filmmaker.</p><p>Their father obsessed over the tanks, cleaning and tending to them even as he failed to care for his sons, the younger Burns brother said. He began to disappear for hours and then days at a time. At night, the boys sat shoulder to shoulder by the window of their white clapboard home, watching the street for signs of his headlights.</p><p>Later, when the brothers were teenagers, their father vanished for months, claiming he was doing “field work” leaving cash for them to pay their expenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>As a baby, Ken Burns appeared in this photo showing his mother spoon feeding him.

By the time he was 17, he had memorized hundreds of numbers and been promoted to assistant manager, he said.</p><p>Their mother’s death and their father’s absence had created both a deep wound and a deep drive for Ken: “It’s a kind of permanent feeling of vulnerability and loss, and I think Ken responded to it by wanting to forge for himself a world that was so fortified — so that he would never have to suffer that again,” Ric Burns said.</p><p>The filmmaker remembers the exact moment when he decided what he wanted to do with his life: He had never seen his father cry — not in all the years his mother had fought an excruciating illness, not even at the funeral — until one night after her death. His family was in the living room in front of their black-and-white TV, watching a movie, and suddenly his father began weeping.</p><p>“I just understood that nothing gave him any safe harbor — nothing,” Ken Burns said, except the film, which had created the space for a bereaved widower to express the fraught emotions he had suppressed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>His first goal was to get away.

It was also because documentaries were not considered commercially viable.</p><p>When “The Civil War” premiered on PBS in 1990, nearly 40 million people watched — it remains the highest-rated program in PBS history, according to a spokeswoman for the public broadcaster. </p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-21"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A storyboard for “American Revolution.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Cenicola/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The script for “Leonardo Da Vinci.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Cenicola/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The week of its premiere, sales of blank cassette tapes on which it could be recorded shot up 40 percent nationwide, according to Adweek.
