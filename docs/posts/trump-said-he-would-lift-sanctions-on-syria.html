He is expected to meet tomorrow with the country’s new leader.</p><p>Trump announced the policy change at the start of his four-day tour of the Middle East. He received a lavish welcome in Saudi Arabia today, complete with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/saudi-arabia-lavender-carpet-trump-visit.html" title="">lavender carpet</a>, a team of Arabian horses and a delegation of royals. Executives from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/trump-saudi-business-lunch-musk-altman.html" title="">some of America’s largest companies</a> also joined him for lunch.</p><p>Our photographer Doug Mills <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/europe/trump-middle-east-photos.html" title="">photographed the day’s extravagant events</a>.</p><p>White House officials said that Trump had already secured $600 billion in deals with the Saudi government and Saudi companies. But the details his aides provided were vague and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-economic-forum.html" title="">totaled less than half that number</a>. Several were already in the works before Trump returned to the White House in January.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Meals provided to Palestinians in Jabaliya, in the northern Gaza Strip, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-53e48f73">Israeli officers concluded Gaza is on the brink of starvation</h2><p>In public, Israel has for months maintained that its blockade on food and fuel to Gaza did not pose a major threat to civilian life. But in private, some senior Israeli officials have said that Palestinians in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-starvation-israel.html" title="">face widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are restored within weeks</a>.</p><p>Israeli military officers who monitor humanitarian conditions in Gaza have warned their commanders in recent days that unless the blockade is lifted quickly, many areas of the enclave are likely to run out of enough food to meet minimum daily nutritional needs. They said that immediate steps were needed to ensure that the aid system could be reinstated fast enough to prevent starvation.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>Israel bombarded Khan Younis in Gaza in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-sinwar-khan-younis.html" title="">an attempt to kill Muhammad Sinwar</a>, one of Hamas’s top remaining leaders.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">D Dipasupil/Getty Images; Amanda Edwards/WireImage, via Getty Images; Richard Perry/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-406fe6f2">A star witness took the stand in Sean Combs’s trial</h2><p>Casandra Ventura, the singer known as Cassie, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/13/arts/sean-combs-diddy-trial-cassie" title="">testified today</a> in the sex trafficking trial of the music mogul Sean Combs.

Her testimony is vital to the prosecution’s case.</p><p>In tear-filled testimony, Ventura told the jury today that Combs’s drug-fueled sex sessions with prostitutes could last several days and made her feel “disgusting” and “humiliated.” She also said there were “violent arguments” and “physical abuse” during her long-term relationship with Combs, describing busted lips, black eyes and “bruises all over my body.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Iris de Moüy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-5b4fd9bd">Data shows that boys are falling behind</h2><p>Boys and young men are struggling.
