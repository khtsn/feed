The City Council in Salt Lake City approved three new flags: one with the rainbow colors of the Pride flag, a second with the pink and blue of the transgender Pride flag and a third with a symbol and date referring to the Juneteenth holiday that commemorates the end of slavery. Each flag also includes the sego lily, a city symbol.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New city flags were adopted by Salt Lake City in response to a recent state law.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salt Lake City Mayor&#39;s Office</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In Boise, the City Council <a href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/community/boise/article305876781.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designated the rainbow Pride flag</a> and a flag promoting organ donation as official city flags.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The City of Boise will continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” Lauren McLean, Boise’s mayor, said in <a href="https://www.cityofboise.org/news/mayor/2025/may/boise-city-council-will-consider-a-flag-resolution-city-accepts-pro-bono-legal-services/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> before the resolution was adopted.</p><p>The Utah legislature <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/us/utah-flag-pride-ban.html" title="">passed a law</a> in March <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0077.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banning the display</a> of flags that are not explicitly approved at public schools and government buildings.
