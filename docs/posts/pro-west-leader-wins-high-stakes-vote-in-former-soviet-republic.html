But, despite its small size, the country has become a focus of big power rivalry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Sunday’s loser, according to near final results, was Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who is under criminal investigation for corruption.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alexandr Stoianoglo, the presidential candidate defeated by Ms. Sandu, and his wife, Tvetana Kurdova, at a polling station on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vladislav Culiomza/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Stoianoglo was supported in his<strong> </strong>failed bid for the presidency by Moldova’s socialist party, a political force long aligned with Russia, and, according to Moldovan officials and investigative journalists, by a vote-buying operation financed and directed from Moscow by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/world/europe/moldova-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">fugitive Moldovan tycoon and convicted fraudster.</a></p><p>Sunday’s runoff followed a first-round vote two weeks earlier in which Ms. Sandu finished far ahead of Mr. Stoianoglo, who came in second, and nine other candidates, several of whom pledged to halt Moldova’s efforts to join the European Union and instead to align the country with Russia. Most of the losers in the first round endorsed Mr. Stoianoglo for the runoff. The turnout on Sunday was more than 54 percent.</p><p>Ms. Sandu’s victory delivered a major lift to the West’s hopes of loosening Moscow’s grip on former Soviet territories, which, with the exception of Ukraine and the three Baltic States, have largely been kept within Russia’s sphere of influence by military, economic and cultural pressure.</p><p>A sliver of Moldovan territory along the Dniester River east of the capital, Chisinau, declared itself an independent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/world/europe/transnistria-moldova-russia-ukraine.html" title="">Russian-speaking state</a> after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left Romanian speakers largely in control of Moldova. The territory has been occupied since 1992 by the Russian military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Hoping to fix Moldova on a clear path to the West, Ms. Sandu pushed for holding a referendum on Oct. 20 on whether to enshrine the “irreversibility” of Moldova’s “European course” in the Constitution. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/europe/moldova-eu-referendum-vote-result.html" title="">referendum passed, but by such a tiny margin</a> — less than 1 percent — that the exercise dulled the sheen of Ms. Sandu’s victory on the same day as the first round of the presidential election.</p><p>It also upended the European Union’s expectations that a robust majority of Moldovans would vote to lock in their country’s alignment with the West. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, still declared the razor-thin majority in the referendum proof that Moldova “wants a European future,” despite “Russia’s hybrid tactics.”</p><p>A former World Bank official who first came to power four years ago promising to root out corruption and Russian influence, Ms. Sandu has been strongly supported by the United States and the European Union, both of which have given Moldova tens of millions of dollars in economic support.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man casting a vote in the first round of voting in Bulboaca village, Moldova, on Oct. 20.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Mihailescu/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Western support intensified after Russia invaded Ukraine, which, like Moldova, is divided along ethnic, socio-economic and linguistic lines, and faced decades of pressure from Moscow not to side with the West by trying to join NATO or the European Union.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Stoianoglo has denied favoring Russia over the West, insisting that he supported Ukraine in its war against Russia and wanted only to prevent Moldova, whose Constitution commits it to neutrality, from being dragged directly into the conflict.</p><p>During a pre-election debate last week, Ms. Sandu challenged Mr. Stoianoglo over claims that he supported Ukraine. “Do you believe what you are saying?” Ms. Sandu asked him. “In Kyiv, they know you’re Moscow’s man.”</p><p>Georgia’s governing party, Georgian Dream, also denied favoring Russia before a pivotal parliamentary election on Oct. 26, which opposition parties claim was stolen. International election monitors reported incidents of vote buying and other irregularities but have not directly challenged the outcome.</p><p>In response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission in June 2022 recommended that Moldova and Ukraine be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/world/europe/ukraine-european-union.html" title="">granted “candidate status,”</a> in the European Union, the first formal step in a process that normally lasts longer than a decade. It gave Georgia the same status last year but, alarmed by last weekend’s disputed election and the recent enactment of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-law-passes.html" title="">“foreign agent” law</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/georgian-president-refuses-to-sign-anti-lgbtq-rights-bill-into-law" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anti-L.

Her opponents stressed more immediate economic issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Dumitru Stantier, 89, whose daughter and granddaughter moved to Germany, said he voted for Mr. Stoianoglo because Ms. Sandu and her governing party, which controls the government, talk constantly about Europe but have done nothing to raise his pension of around $218 a month.</p><p>“Can I live on this with today’s prices? Do they even think about it? Do they give any help?” he said. “Bandits!”</p><p>Russia has for years reviled Ms. Sandu as a Western puppet intent on surrendering Moldova’s sovereignty and traditional values, claiming that her push to join the European Union would lead to children being brainwashed into becoming gay or transgender.</p><p>The same cultural issues, amplified by Russian media and the Orthodox Church, also played a role in Georgia’s election, which the country’s pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili — elected separately from and at odds with the government — denounced as a “Russian operation”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia at a rally protesting the results of the parliamentary election won by the ruling Georgian Dream party, in Tbilisi last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Irakli Gedenidze/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In Moldova, Ms. Sandu and her supporters accused Moscow of mounting an intensive campaign of disinformation and vote buying aimed at swaying Sunday’s result.</p><p>Journalists from Ziarul de Garda, an investigative newspaper in Chisinau, <a href="https://www.zdg.md/investigatii/ancheta/video-cum-a-fost-fraudat-referendumul-reteaua-lui-sor-de-partea-lui-stoianoglo-in-slujba-moscovei-ii-o-noua-investigatie-zdg-sub-acoperire/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">infiltrated a political network in Moldova financed and directed by Ilan Shor,</a> the fugitive tycoon, and reported that it had paid voters to cast ballots against Ms. Sandu.</p><p>Mr. Shor has denied doing anything illegal, casting himself as a victim because he faces jail if he returns to his home country for his role in the r<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/world/europe/moldova-bank-theft.html" title="">ansacking of Moldova’s banking system</a>.
