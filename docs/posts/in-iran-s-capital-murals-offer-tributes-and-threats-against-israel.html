They are written in both Hebrew and Persian to make sure nothing is lost in translation. And as the crisis between the two countries has deepened, the rhetoric has become sharper.</p><p>In January, the message to Israel read, “Prepare your coffins,” with the backdrop of missiles being fired. In April, text on the Star of David read, “Die from this fear.” Last week, a photo collage of hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas, the militant group which Iran supports, carried a grim statement: “None of the hostages will be released.”</p><p>After Israel carried out a retaliatory wave of airstrikes targeting Iranian military sites and air defenses protecting energy facilities on Saturday, the mural changed again. It now says, in Hebrew: “Another storm is coming.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Center for Islamic Propaganda, an institution that is under control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, oversees the murals, which appear on an office building owned by the center.</p><p>Supporters of Iran’s government often gather for protests in Palestine Square donning checkered kaffiyehs and waving the flags of Palestine and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that Iran also backs. A tent is set up to collect aid donations for Palestinians and Lebanese.</p><p>In 2021, long before Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the war that followed in Gaza, Iran set up a digital clock in the square that counts down the days until it purports Israel will be destroyed. Here is a collection of some of the murals that have appeared in recent months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-3"><div><h2>April 3</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p>Sometimes the mural commemorates a senior Iranian military commander or the leader of one of the militant groups aligned with Iran, a network known as the “axis of resistance.” Those groups include Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. This mural shows Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a veteran of the Quds Forces, the external branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps responsible for operations in Lebanon and Syria. He was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus in April.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p>Iran vowed to retaliate against Israel’s attack on its embassy compound in Damascus. Crowds of government supporters gathered at Palestine Square chanting, “Revenge!” As Israel awaited an Iranian attack, the mural depicted a Star of David and missiles raining down. A message in Hebrew read, “Die from this fear.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-7"><div><h2>April 15</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p>Iran fired at least 300 drones and missiles at Israel on April 14 in retaliation for the Damascus strike. Supporters celebrated the attack with fireworks and by waving giant flags of Iran and Palestine. The mural was promptly updated, showing a burning Israeli flag with the words, “The next slap will be harder.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-8"><div><h2>July 31</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel assassinated Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July on the eve of the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s new president. Mr. Haniyeh was killed at a highly secure guest compound run by the Quds Forces. Israel’s brazen assassination shook Iran’s leaders and humiliated the country’s intelligence and security apparatuses. The mural with Mr. Haniyeh’s picture reads, “Wait for a fierce revenge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-9"><div><h2>Aug. 23</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p>When Hamas named Yahya Sinwar, a longtime Hamas military leader, as its top official, replacing Mr. Haniyeh in August, Iran celebrated with a large profile picture of Mr. Sinwar. The message read, “Martyr of Islam, Commander of Jihad.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p>In mid-October, Israeli soldiers killed Mr. Sinwar on the battlefield in Gaza. For Iran, it was another devastating blow after the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut a few weeks earlier. The mural depicting Mr. Sinwar reads, “The storm of Sinwar will continue.” It is a reference to Al-Aqsa Storm, the Arabic term used by Hamas for its Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-12"><div><h2>Oct. 19</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p>A digital clock in Palestine Square, set up in 2021, counts down the several thousand days remaining until Israel will purportedly be destroyed.

As it awaited Israel’s expected retaliation earlier this month, Iranian officials said they were prepared for war with Israel and that the country’s response would depend on the scope and severity of Israel’s attacks. Last week, the mural took a dark tone. It showed a collage of photographs of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza with words, “No hostages will be freed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-15"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel’s retaliatory strike on Iran early Saturday marked a new escalation between the two archrivals, although it appeared to be calibrated to stop short of the all-out war the region fears. Iran’s leaders stressed on Sunday that they had a right to respond to Israel’s attack but appeared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/27/world/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza#iran-ayatollah-israel" title="">take a measured tone</a>, which could help ease those concerns. The mural, however, changed over the weekend, and now states: “Another storm is coming.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Farnaz Fassihi is the United Nations bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the organization, and also covers Iran and the shadow war between Iran and Israel.
