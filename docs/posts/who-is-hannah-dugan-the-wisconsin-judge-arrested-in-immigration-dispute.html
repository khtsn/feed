Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, on suspicion that she “intentionally misdirected federal agents away from” an immigrant being pursued by federal authorities, <a href="https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1915800907318468626" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, wrote</a> on social media. The authorities said that in March, Judge Dugan directed an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom while the agents waited in a public hallway to apprehend him.</p><p>Judge Dugan, widely known in progressive circles in Milwaukee, was elected by a wide margin in 2016, beating an incumbent appointee of Scott Walker, the Republican former governor of Wisconsin. Judge Dugan was unopposed for re-election in 2022. Her current term expires in 2028.</p><p>In 2023, she <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/31/judge-dismisses-gop-suit-challenging-milwaukee-voter-outreach-effort/70500584007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dismissed</a> a lawsuit brought by the Republican Party of Wisconsin that argued a get-out-the-vote effort in Milwaukee violated the law.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Dugan, 65, graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1987 and took a job at Legal Action of Wisconsin, a group that provides free legal services. She worked as a lawyer specializing in housing, public benefits and Social Security cases, and was the coordinator of the organization’s pro bono attorney program from 1990 to 1994, according to her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-c-dugan-28793b1b/details/experience/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>.</p><p>She later worked as the executive director for Catholic Charities of Southeastern Wisconsin. Judge Dugan has also served on the Milwaukee County Ethics Board.</p><p>As a lawyer for Legal Aid, Judge Dugan took on cases defending the indigent. In 1995, she represented people who panhandled on downtown sidewalks, arguing that banning them from doing so was unconstitutional.</p><p>In 2000, she argued that a surge in tickets written for “quality-of-life” issues had resulted in intimidation.</p><p>“Anecdotally, from my clients, people don’t want to go to court, much less to trial, because they’ve been particularly intimidated by officers,” she told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at the time. “We’ve seen an increase in complaints of harassment and abuse.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Judge Dugan lost a judicial race in 2012. During the campaign, she said she was nonpartisan and would be impartial, according to the Journal Sentinel.</p><p>“Justice is hard work.

I think she takes her obligations seriously as a judge.”</p><p>In 2021, Judge Dugan was a <a href="https://issuu.com/shepherdexpress/docs/shxxxxxx-mgz_november2021_shepherd_publication_web" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finalist</a> in the “Most Trusted Public Official” category in the Best of Milwaukee contest in The Shepherd Express, an alternative publication.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=94&amp;Issue=8&amp;ArticleID=28623" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> she wrote that year detailing the history of women in Wisconsin’s legal profession, Judge Dugan noted that a “passion project” of hers was to have her picture taken outside of every courthouse in Wisconsin.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>North Carolina Supreme Court Race:</strong> The Republican challenger has embarked on an extraordinary effort to reverse his election loss that critics say is testing the boundaries of post-election litigation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/north-carolina-supreme-court-race-explainer.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Starbase, Texas:</strong> It has been a rough patch for Elon Musk, but he is about to realize a dream for SpaceX, its employees and for himself: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/elon-musk-town-starbase-texas.html">His own town on the southern tip of Texas</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rigging of the Texas Lottery:</strong> Texas lottery executives blessed a scheme that ensured one player would win a $95 million jackpot in 2023.
