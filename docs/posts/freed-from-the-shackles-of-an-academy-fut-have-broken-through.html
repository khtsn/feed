                  <p>&#34;The best thing in this NAVI Junior team was that everyone decided to drop out from school,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a>&#39;s 25-year-old coach, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">András <span>&#34;⁠coolio⁠&#34;</span> Fercsák</a>, tells me as we begin talking about his team&#39;s rise. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t say it was an expectation. We didn&#39;t ask them, but they felt they had to do it. So it gave us a lot of time, and we could play. We were practicing like a tier-one team, the schedule was the same. We were starting from 11:00 until… the time we finished [changed], but [until] like 5, 6, 7... and yeah, we could play every tournament, but not where NAVI was participating.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We had a really good mood. Everyone wanted to show that he was better than the others. We were working so hard every day. As I said, it was a full-time job for them already, we were just grinding non-stop. Then we played as many tournaments as we could. We just decided to do it like this: if we couldn&#39;t practice for a few days or a few weeks because we have officials, even if we have three best of three in a day, we will just go and play because we need the experience. We wanted to play as much as we could, and in the end, the results came and then it was just better and better.&#34;</p>
                  <p>That grind has paid off for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> early in 2026, a year in which they&#39;ve been fully freed to compete in the tier-one circuit and have impressed with their three prospects in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20584/dem0n" data-tooltip-id="uid446303191">Dmytro <span>&#34;⁠dem0n⁠&#34;</span> Myroshnychenko</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/23553/dziugss" data-tooltip-id="uid844580732">Džiugas <span>&#34;⁠dziugss⁠&#34;</span> Steponavičius</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22203/krabeni" data-tooltip-id="uid1119892940">Aulon <span>&#34;⁠Krabeni⁠&#34;</span> Fazlija</a>.</p>

                  </a>
                  <p>Plenty of talented players have come through the academies of organizations since the programs became a regular fixture in Counter-Strike — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/18987/b1t" data-tooltip-id="uid193597140">Valeriy <span>&#34;⁠b1t⁠&#34;</span> Vakhovskiy</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/19230/m0nesy" data-tooltip-id="uid1138995127">Ilya <span>&#34;⁠m0NESY⁠&#34;</span> Osipov</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/21167/donk" data-tooltip-id="uid208916168">Danil <span>&#34;⁠donk⁠&#34;</span> Kryshkovets</a>, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11176/mouz-nxt" data-tooltip-id="uid444711108">MOUZ NXT</a> quartet (with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/16820/siuhy" data-tooltip-id="uid912667080">Kamil <span>&#34;⁠siuhy⁠&#34;</span> Szkaradek</a>), to name just a few.</p>
                  <p>But what happens when an entire team, rather than just a player or two, outgrows its academy moniker?</p>
                  <div>
                    <p itemprop="video"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fyUAIVkW0Y?autoplay=0" width="100%" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>
                  </div>
                  <p>That became a reality for five members of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/10371/navi-junior" data-tooltip-id="uid528877627">NAVI Junior</a> in June 2025, when the team won YaLLa Compass Spring and two CCT events, surging into the top 30 of the VRS and becoming eligible for invites to notable LANs. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/4608/natus-vincere" data-tooltip-id="uid572364355">Natus Vincere</a>, in need of a replacement for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/19206/jl" data-tooltip-id="uid829906698">Justinas <span>&#34;⁠jL⁠&#34;</span> Lekavicius</a>, made use of their academy pipeline and promoted <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22673/makazze" data-tooltip-id="uid1573724732">Drin <span>&#34;⁠makazze⁠&#34;</span> Shaqiri</a> to the main roster. But the rest of the team was put up for sale — a tantalizing proposition for organizations seeking a young, promising core with a decent VRS rank.</p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/42078/navi-announce-makazze-promotion">

                  </a>
                  <p>&#34;The plan for NAVI, I think it wasn&#39;t to let us go, but the level we were playing… at some point we were top 23 in the VRS,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> says. &#34;It was obvious that we don&#39;t want to be an academy anymore. And I think Na&#39;Vi just came up with a decision that they have to move on.</p>
                  <p>&#34;And there were two or three options, like to pick up someone into the main team, to sell us one by one, or sell together because we had a pretty good core. And they needed a player, so sadly, they took away makazze from us. And then they just decided to keep this team together because we really like to work with each other.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The loss of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22673/makazze" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1573724732">makazze</a> came as a big blow. It was something <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> says he was ready for, but set the team back as he was in his &#34;comfort zone&#34; with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22673/makazze" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1573724732">makazze</a>. It was also the first time in the 26-year-old&#39;s coaching career that he had to replace a player and work out how to integrate a new one, and the timing of the change meant that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/10371/navi-junior" data-tooltip-id="uid528877627">NAVI Junior</a> couldn&#39;t capitalize on their ranking and qualify for the Budapest Major.</p>

                  <p>The team didn&#39;t immediately land on a replacement, initially playing with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/14176/misutaaa" data-tooltip-id="uid1901150138">Kévin <span>&#34;⁠misutaaa⁠&#34;</span> Rabier</a> after moving to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a>, but it quickly became apparent to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> that the French rifler wasn&#39;t the right fit for what the team needed.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I had to understand that he is a really good guy, like he was doing his best, but the role he had to fill wasn&#39;t for him,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> says. &#34;If it wasn&#39;t that role, I probably would have kept him on the team, but in that role I expected something else and I didn&#39;t feel the same as what I felt with makazze because this role requires some aggressiveness and some YOLO plays and stuff like this. He was more like a passive guy, and we really thought that we needed someone else. That&#39;s why we decided to go and find something else, and then we ended up on lauNX at this time.&#34;</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20761/launx" data-tooltip-id="uid764200525">Laurențiu <span>&#34;⁠lauNX⁠&#34;</span> Țârlea</a> brought the kind of experience and boisterous attitude the team needed, and it was a chance at redemption for him after he put up numbers in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/7187/nexus" data-tooltip-id="uid1851345055">Nexus</a> after a rough few years jumping between teams and dreary periods on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11283/falcons" data-tooltip-id="uid1464044521">Falcons</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/8637/sprout" data-tooltip-id="uid1230640676">Sprout</a>.</p>
                  <p>The talent on the team was clear, so much so that they were accused of cheating as they continued to show promise online. The noise only got louder after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> followed up their online Exort The Proving Grounds Season 4 victory with a last-place exit at their first LAN, Birch Cup, where <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> admits tournament conditions weren&#39;t ideal and the team&#39;s clear inexperience on LAN was on full display.</p>
                  <p>Playing with in-ears rather than the headsets they were used to at home, the environment, the pressure that comes with it, and little to no LAN experience for the majority of the roster was a learning experience, and one that the team made full use of in a bootcamp ahead of a trip to Shanghai for CS Asia Championships. They started to practice with in-ears to adjust to the feeling they&#39;d have on LAN, and worked hard to shut out the noise around them.</p>
                  <p>&#34;The players also knew that nobody was cheating,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> says. &#34;Like, if you are in TeamSpeak, you understand why we lose. There was a communication issue. The first LAN we played, the comms were fully different. People were screaming, it was full chaotic, not like online, so of course you&#39;re gonna lose rounds because you cannot focus. And then we were just trying to tweak it. That&#39;s why we went for a bootcamp. We started playing with in-ears so players get used to it.&#34;</p>

                  <p>And redemption followed. A pair of wins over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/6667/faze" data-tooltip-id="uid9980266">FaZe</a> — who, admittedly, were jetlagged from an overnight flight from ESL Pro League — at CAC and a near-victory over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12468/legacy" data-tooltip-id="uid93130181">Legacy</a> became a breakthrough moment, both to cast doubts off the team and give them the confidence that they could really do it.</p>
                  <p>&#34;You have to take the chances, always,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> says. &#34;And we had the chance to play versus FaZe, we were happy about it, because we knew that they would arrive pretty late, like they might have some jet lag, and this is an advantage, and you have to take every advantage. We started the game shaky again, and… I think everybody just started feeling it again. It was like 9-0 for them, or 8-0, and we are like, &#39;Maybe we are really cheating,&#39; (laughs), you know, like people get this in their head.</p>
                  <p>&#34;And then somehow we won one round, we got back into the game, we could come back. And I think that was the breaking point. We gained a lot of confidence and trust and we beat them. And at this LAN we did a really amazing job, like we knocked out paiN, like pretty easily. It was a really one-sided game. Then we beat FaZe in a best-of-three, which was a crazy good result for us even though they had a new player and they had no time to practice.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We were happy to make it to the arena, and it was sad that there was no crowd because we wanted to experience that also, but we couldn&#39;t. And I think we should have won this Legacy game, but we just choked it on Inferno. It was our game, and we just threw it away sadly. But you need to lose to improve and to learn from it, so it&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>

                  <p>That mindset showed again at DraculaN Season 3, where <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> endured another slow start and were immediately knocked down to the lower bracket after losing their opener to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13237/am" data-tooltip-id="uid606279687">AM</a>. But it was, in one way, a blessing in disguise as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> completed a grueling lower bracket run by winning seven series straight to lift the trophy in Romania, earning a wealth of VRS points in the process.</p>
                  <p>They were shooting up the ranking again and earned more points with a runners-up finish at DreamHack Knockout Stockholm to end the year inside the top 20 on the VRS — although the defeat, at the time, meant they would miss out on a spot in ESL Pro League Season 23 and an invite to PGL Cluj-Napoca.</p>
                  <p>The results were but an omen of what was to come in 2026, a year which, just three months in, has already been a breakout one for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a>. Teams were knocking at the door to buy out players during the break, but a decision to stick together and see where things can go this season has already proved dividends.</p>
                  <p>It began with a 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/10503/og" data-tooltip-id="uid869553203">OG</a> in the online BLAST Bounty before <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> put <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid1952981486">FURIA</a> — and the scene at large — on notice, just barely losing out in a three-map series that would have qualified them for the LAN final after a Herculean effort from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/24144/molodoy" data-tooltip-id="uid1256858736">Danil <span>&#34;⁠molodoy⁠&#34;</span> Golubenko</a> dragged his team over the finish line.</p>
                  <p>&#34;It was a really good event for us because we came after a strong end to the season,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> says. &#34;Then it was really good that OG picked us. But I think what I said previously, that other teams have to be scared of us, BLAST Bounty showed that really well because we were watching the draft and I think we were the sixth or seventh team that got picked. Everybody tried to skip us.&#34;</p>

                  <p>Picking <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid1952981486">FURIA</a> was a worthy gamble out of the four teams left in the pool, and one <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> doesn&#39;t regret. But the team&#39;s inexperience, and his own, shone through in the loss and aftermath.</p>
                  <p>&#34;As a coach, afterward you need to say something to the team, and in my head I was burning a little bit because I knew that we made some mistakes that lost the game for us,&#34; he says. &#34;But at the same time you need to say, &#39;We did amazing, we put up a good fight,&#39; and that you need to gain confidence again from this because we can match up with the best teams in the world — or the second best team, it doesn&#39;t matter — and then we are ready and we are capable of doing it and actually we could have beat them.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The defeat wasn&#39;t a blow to the team&#39;s confidence, but what came after was. An early exit from the IEM Rio Europe Qualifier, where all eyes were upon them, was a reality check. Pressure got to them, partially because they were now one of the favorites and partially as they lost matches to the likes of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/10254/big-academy" data-tooltip-id="uid928675180">BIG Academy</a>.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>I&#39;m happy that we lost, because if we did something good there, maybe we would go into Krakow with the mindset that we will just beat everyone and maybe that&#39;s why we would lose</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p>&#34;It&#39;s heartbreaking that we lost 41 [VRS] points in the end, which feels really bad, but I think it was a good hit in our face and it was a wake-up call that we are not the best team in the world, we cannot underestimate anyone, and we have to still work hard and we need to do everything to make it work.</p>
                  <p>&#34;So yeah, after the loss, we were sad, we were tilted, and then after a few days… I would say that I&#39;m happy that we lost, because if we did something good there, maybe we would go into Krakow with the mindset that we will just beat everyone and maybe that&#39;s why we would lose.&#34;</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20584/dem0n" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid446303191">dem0n</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/23553/dziugss" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid844580732">dziugss</a>, two of the top players in HLTV&#39;s Prospects report, were living up to their billing, and the slap in the face from losing in the Rio qualifier did well to wake the team up ahead of its biggest challenge yet at IEM Krakow. Another shaky start resulted in a loss to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/4914/3dmax" data-tooltip-id="uid367253169">3DMAX</a>, but wins over <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12468/legacy" data-tooltip-id="uid93130181">Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/5973/liquid" data-tooltip-id="uid1685102572">Liquid</a> offered redemption and put <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> through to the main stage.</p>
                  <p>And revenge awaited. An opening draw against <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid1952981486">FURIA</a>, where <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/20584/dem0n" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid446303191">dem0n</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/23553/dziugss" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid844580732">dziugss</a> delivered again to sweep the series, showed that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> were not a mere flash in the pan, but an arena berth in tier-one must be earned. Inexperience shone through in a narrow loss to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/5995/g2" data-tooltip-id="uid269844704">G2</a> that could have put <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> through to the playoffs, and again in the lower bracket against <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1438435914">Astralis</a>, where they dropped a 9-5 lead on map two and ended up losing the series.</p>
                  <p>But teams were clearly taking notice of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a>&#39;s potential, and praise was heaped upon them by their fellow competitors.</p>
                  
                  <p>That could have been the last the tier-one scene saw of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a> for a while, but they became the beneficiaries of a spot at PGL Cluj-Napoca after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12468/legacy" data-tooltip-id="uid93130181">Legacy</a> withdrew from the event. And again, they delivered on the world stage in Romania by beating <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/11861/aurora" data-tooltip-id="uid1656897696">Aurora</a>, getting revenge on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/6665/astralis" data-tooltip-id="uid1438435914">Astralis</a>, and pushing <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/8297/furia" data-tooltip-id="uid1952981486">FURIA</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/12467/parivision" data-tooltip-id="uid448373806">PARIVISION</a> the distance. A 12-3 lead dropped against <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/4494/mouz" data-tooltip-id="uid1477437610">MOUZ</a> on Overpass showed there is still a lot of work to be done to prevent crumbling in key moments, but the team is willing to put in that work.</p>

                  <p>&#34;Right now, what we achieved together is amazing,&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/coach/14202/coolio" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid561001818">coolio</a> says. &#34;We came from the academy, we grinded together, then we made it to top. Everyone was really confident that we could do well this year, and we just decided to stay in the team at least for six months and maybe until the next transfer break.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Maybe offers will come again, probably they will, and maybe someone will leave, maybe not. You never know that. But we are on the same page, we understand each other. If somebody has a great offer, go; we will be happy for you and you can move on. But I think it was the player&#39;s decision in the end and my decision that we just wanted to stay, and we really believe that we can make it to the Major.&#34;</p>
                  <p>Consistent invites to the biggest tournaments, a replacement invite to ESL Pro League Season 23, and a stable place in the rankings ahead of the April 6 cut-off for Cologne are making that look like more of a reality than a simple possibility for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/team/13286/fut" data-tooltip-id="uid1879930757">FUT</a>.</p>
                  <p>And while they are only just starting to be feared on LAN, they&#39;ll be back in their element as Pro League kicks off online on March 1.</p>
