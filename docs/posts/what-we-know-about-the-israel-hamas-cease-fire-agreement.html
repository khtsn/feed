Hostages would start being released during that phase, said officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the deal.</p><p>President Biden said that during the first phrase of the agreement, Palestinians would be able to return to their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, much of which has been leveled, and would have access to a surge of humanitarian supplies.</p><h2 id="link-a238a64">Who will be freed?</h2><p>If implemented, the cease-fire would allow for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israel. About 100 hostages are thought to still be in Gaza, although the Israeli authorities believe around 35 of those people are dead.</p><p>Hamas leaders want to free Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.</p><p>Mr. Al Thani said some 33 Israeli hostages would be released over the course of the 42-day agreement, but he did not say how many Palestinian prisoners would be released.</p><h2 id="link-637e7577">What happens next?</h2><p>The agreement needs to be formally ratified by the Israeli government, two senior Israeli officials said. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in a statement that a number of details in the agreement remained unresolved, but that it was hoped that they would be worked out on Wednesday night.</p><p>The ratification votes in Israel are expected on Thursday morning and are likely to test the government’s unity, as at least two hard-line factions have already announced their opposition to striking a deal with Hamas.</p><h2 id="link-3ffc2bfb">Why did talks move forward?</h2><p>The talks have also gained momentum since Israel reached <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-ceasefire.html" title="">a separate cease-fire agreement</a> with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel immediately after the Hamas-led attack of October 2023. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-nasrallah-assassination-intelligence.html" title="">Battered badly</a> by its escalating conflict with Israel, Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire with Israel in November, a deal that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/us/politics/hamas-hezbollah-israel.html" title="">helped isolate Hamas</a>.</p><p>Some officials have suggested that the change in U.S. administrations, set to take place on Monday, Jan. 20, put pressure on Israel and Hamas to accelerate their decision-making after months of delay.</p><p>The incoming U.S. president, Donald J. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/trump-hostages-hamas.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">has warned</a> that there will be “all hell to pay” unless the Israeli hostages are freed by the time he takes office.

THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!”</p><p>At a news conference, President Biden seemed to acknowledge that his administration has worked with the Trump administration. He noted that although the deal was developed and negotiated under his administration, its terms would be implemented for the most part by the next administration. “In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
