I’m not breathing right now. We don’t know if they are on the list, if they’re going to come back in the first phase, if they’re alive. We actually don’t know anything, so scary.” “The deal is structured in three phases. Phase 1 will last six weeks. It includes a full and complete cease-fire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded.” “We expect the parties to stay committed to what they have committed themselves to in that agreement.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/14/multimedia/14ceasefire-wwk-1-tflv/14ceasefire-wwk-1-tflv-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The Israeli cabinet still has to ratify the deal, and some details remained unresolved.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p><time datetime="2025-01-15T20:27:10-05:00"><span>Published <!-- -->Jan. 14, 2025</span><span>Updated <!-- -->Jan. 15, 2025, <span>8:27 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Negotiators from Israel and Hamas have agreed to a cease-fire in Gaza after more than 15 months of devastating war, officials said Wednesday.</p><p>The Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country helped mediate the talks, said the deal would achieve the release of hostages and prisoners, and a return to “sustainable calm.” </p><p>Under the deal, the cease-fire would begin on Sunday, Jan. 19, he said, adding that both sides were still working on resolving some of the logistical matters.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/15/world/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-gaza" title="">Follow our live coverage here</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-4be6c26a">What’s in the agreement?</h2><p>The cease-fire’s first phase, which would last six weeks, would see Israeli forces withdraw to the east of Gaza, away from populated areas. Hostages would start being released during that phase, said officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the deal.</p><p>President Biden said that during the first phrase of the agreement, Palestinians would be able to return to their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, much of which has been leveled, and would have access to a surge of humanitarian supplies.</p><h2 id="link-a238a64">Who will be freed?</h2><p>If implemented, the cease-fire would allow for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israel.

He noted that although the deal was developed and negotiated under his administration, its terms would be implemented for the most part by the next administration. “In these past few days, we’ve been speaking as one team,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
