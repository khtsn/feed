    <h1>Japan Once Dominated the Art Market. Is the Country Ready for a Comeback?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Yuko Mohri thought she knew what the Japanese government wanted from its artists: something conservative and quiet. It certainly wasn’t a renegade punk rocker with a penchant for moldy fruits.</p><p>“It started out as a joke,” she said during a recent interview in her Tokyo studio. She was explaining how memories of a school science experiment that turned lemons into makeshift batteries had spurred the idea for a proposal to fill the Japanese Pavilion at the 2024 Venice Biennale with hanging lights plugged into pieces of fruit that would eventually rot. The exhibit was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/arts/design/venice-biennale-review-art-israel.html" title="">critical succes</a>s.</p><p>But the real story of her success happened behind the scenes, where government officials, gallerists and business leaders formed a financial network capable of supporting a Japanese artist like her on the international stage. It was part of a larger movement in Japan to reclaim the cultural clout that the country enjoyed in the 1980s, when it dominated the global art market.</p><p>Those were the days when Japanese corporations regularly bought European treasures, helping transform the art market from a rich person’s hobby into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/arts/design/young-artists-auctions-collectors.html" title="">an investment vehicle</a>. A strong currency and a government campaign to promote foreign spending to expand Japanese business abroad led to jaw-dropping auction sales for Impressionist paintings by Renoir, Monet and Cézanne. From 1987 to 1991, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/19/world/art-bought-during-boom-leaves-japan-after-bust.html" title="">official trade figures</a> showed that Japanese collectors spent more than $8.7 billion ($16.5 billion in today’s dollars) on art. The trend peaked with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/18/arts/businessman-identified-as-buyer-of-van-gogh.html" title="">1990 sale</a> of van Gogh’s “Portrait of Dr. Gachet” for $82.5 million, the highest price paid for an auctioned artwork at the time — roughly $200 million in today’s dollars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Then the financial markets collapsed, leading to a period of economic stagnation in the 1990s known as the “Lost Decade,” until <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/asia/japan-election.html" title="">issues persisted</a> for so long that some people renamed it the “Lost 30 Years.” Museums that had opened in the corporate skyscrapers dotting the Tokyo skyline had their acquisition budgets slashed, and bankrupt collectors sold their masterpieces offshore because of the crash. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/26/arts/00japan-art-market-hcjv/00japan-art-market-hcjv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/26/arts/00japan-art-market-hcjv/00japan-art-market-hcjv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/26/arts/00japan-art-market-hcjv/00japan-art-market-hcjv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two men in tuxedos stand at a podium that reads &#34;Christie&#39;s,&#34; while a woman stands below and to their left next to a Van Gogh painting." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/26/arts/00japan-art-market-hcjv/00japan-art-market-hcjv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/26/arts/00japan-art-market-hcjv/00japan-art-market-hcjv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/26/arts/00japan-art-market-hcjv/00japan-art-market-hcjv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/26/arts/00japan-art-market-hcjv/00japan-art-market-hcjv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/0bf56549-628d-5cdc-98be-5be62231dd95" decoding="async" width="600" height="427"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Japan’s art-market domination peaked with the 1990 sale of van Gogh’s “Portrait of Dr. Gachet” for $82.5 million.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Peter Morgan/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Art and money collided in the boom days of the Japanese economy to help some Japanese artists find a global audience. And though today collectors don’t have the same kind of buying power as they did in the 1980s, it was enough last year to help fund Mohri’s exhibition at the Venice Biennale. Additionally, this time around, the government was getting involved.</p><p>Yasuta Hayashi joined the country’s cultural affairs agency in the shadow of the crash. It was 1994, and programs supporting the Japanese art market had evaporated. It would take another 20 years for the government to have meaningful programs to cultivate new generations of artists and dealers, whichHayashi helped spearhead.</p><p>“The agency of cultural affairs decided to hold special meetings to decide how to promote Japanese contemporary art outside of Japan,” said Hayashi, now the agency’s director of arts and culture, adding that promotional plans were drawn up in October 2014.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There was a long list of priorities, and the government has made progress over the years, especially in its attempts to make buying art more appealing through tax incentive programs. For example, in 2018 the government decided to exempt 80 percent of an artwork’s value from inheritance tax for collectors if they lent works to museums for at least five years; in 2021, the rule was expanded to include contemporary art.</p><p>Hayashi said that his office is also working on additional proposals that would provide more tax breaks.</p><p>“We have been working on the infrastructure,” he added. “The next phase is that we need to invigorate contemporary art activities going forward to make the art market more active.”</p><p>Many gallery owners are hoping the changes come soon. Record-high numbers of tourists and programs like <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/ack-kyoto-fair-2559894" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Art Collaboration Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/11/04/everything-is-elemental-the-art-week-tokyo-focus-exhibition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Art Week Tokyo</a> have raised the profile of the Japanese art world. And the arrival of Pace Gallery, a luxury art dealer from the United States, has signaled that the Japanese art market may be on the rise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Programs like Art Collaboration Tokyo are part of the government’s new focus on supporting Japanese artists and the art market.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Art Collaboration Kyoto; Photo by Moriya Yuki</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>According to a <a href="https://www.bunka.go.jp/koho_hodo_oshirase/hodohappyo/pdf/94146701_03.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent report</a> by the economist Clare McAndrew for the Japanese government, there was an 11 percent increase in the value of Japan’s art market from 2019 to 2023, growing from $611 million in total sales to $681 million. The percent increase was much higher than the global market as a whole, which expanded by only 1 percent over the same time period.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Tim Blum, who has operated a gallery in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo for the last decade, said that he saw positive changes in the business. “There have been really dramatic changes here with more collectors who have become savvy,” said Blum, whose headquarters are in Los Angeles. “It doesn’t mean that Japan is the largest collecting class in the region, but it does mean that everyone in Asia comes to Tokyo. I have many Chinese clients that have second homes here.”</p><p>Blum said that Japanese collectors are more circumspect than Western collectors in their approach to choosing works for purchase. And there is reluctance to spend money with foreign dealers, especially after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/japan-yen-nikkei-stocks.html" title="">value of the yen crashed</a> this past summer. Many collectors are still loyal to the country’s major department stores, which have a history of selling fine art.</p><p>“In Japan, department stores for my parents and my grandparents were the place to go,” said Kyoko Hattori, who leads Pace Gallery’s Tokyo outpost. “The department stores would come to you, bringing fashions for the fall and paintings for the house. For wealthy people, it was like having your own butler.”</p><p>But the department stores are a closed system that caters to domestic clients; few artists represented by the stores draw international attention.</p><p>“There is a very famous proverb,” the collector Ryutaro Takahashi joked. “‘It is the end of the world once the department stores start selling the artists.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A recent exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo showed pieces from the collection of Ryutaro Takahashi, one of the most prominent collectors in Japan.

Trained as a psychiatrist, he was an early collector of Yayoi Kusama and decided to focus his spending on Japanese contemporary artists including Yoshitomo Nara, Takashi Murakami and Akira Yamaguchi. He then turned to a younger set of artists — like the Japanese art collective <a href="https://www.instagram.com/side_core_tokyo/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Side Core</a> — who were inspired to create political work after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He is skeptical that new tax incentives or the arrival of more Western galleries will improve the lives of Japanese artists.</p><p>“The Western art world has deteriorated because of financialization,” Takahashi said during a tour of his exhibition at the museum. “There is no point giving a tax break to the limited number of rich people who buy art. We should be looking for a better environment so that young artists can make a living and promote their artworks.”</p><p>But efforts to support Japanese artists like Yuko Mohri are still nascent. For example, the initiative to fund the Japanese Pavilion at the Venice Biennale was started by Takeo Obayashi, a prominent Japanese collector. He saw an opportunity to use Mohri’s exhibition at the art world’s version of the Olympics to make a statement about the rise of contemporary art in Japan.</p><p>“Increasing the number of people connected to the cause will ultimately lead to an increase in the number of art fans,” said Obayashi, the chairman of one of Japan’s largest construction companies. In <a href="https://www.tokyoartbeat.com/articles/-/venice-biennale-obayashi-taguchi-maki-interview-202407" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview</a> with Art Beat Tokyo, he explained that he “realized that in order for Japan, which has become a mature nation, to make a breakthrough and demonstrate a stronger economy and increase its national power, it will need creativity in addition to the excellent technological development capabilities that Japan already possesses.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yuko Mohri’s installation in the Japanese Pavilion at the 2024 Venice Biennale.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Casey Kelbaugh for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Opportunities are very limited,” Mohri said, explaining why only a few Japanese artists find an international audience.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kentaro Takahashi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Even with the financial support, Mohri said that 70 percent of her time preparing for the Venice Biennale was spent on administrative tasks related to fund-raising and logistics. But she hoped that would be an investment in the future, and that Japan’s next biennale artist would have a better road map, with necessary support along the way.</p><p>“Opportunities are very limited,” Mohri said, explaining why only a few Japanese artists find an international audience. Raised in a family of teachers an hour outside of Tokyo, she joined an experimental punk band during college in the 2000s, taking part-time jobs serving meals on the bullet train and catering to businessmen in a hostess club to support her career. “I really enjoyed the conversation, and mostly I learned about human desire,” Mohri, now 44, said with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>In 2014, when she participated in the Yokohama Triennial, her artistic career began to gain traction. She taught herself English — rare in the insular Japanese art scene — and started networking with international curators, which helped raise her profile around Asia, Europe and the Americas. In 2015, she won the Grand Prix at the 2015 Nissan Art Awards for “Moré Moré (Leaky),” a kinetic sculpture that was inspired by the improvised ways that Tokyo subway stations patch leaks with anything on hand, including plastic tubing, umbrellas, tarps, funnels and buckets.</p><p>The sculpture was included at the Japanese Pavilion at the Venice Biennale alongside her moldy fruit installation, “Compose,” which featured more than 400 rotting oranges, watermelons, grapes and apples.</p><p>Government officials said they were interested in building a more experimental arts sector, one that could match the resourcefulness of Mohri’s sculptures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“The Japanese are not so good at appreciating our own culture,” said Hayashi, the cultural affairs director. “We recognize the value of those artworks appreciated by the West.”</p><p>He added: “We need to change this practice so that we can have our own appreciation of the arts.”</p><p>Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zachary Small is a Times reporter writing about the art world’s relationship to money, politics and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zachary-small">More about Zachary Small</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>AR</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Hopes for an Upturn, With a Boost<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Vast World of Art and Design</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Impressionism Quiz: </strong>It’s been 150 years since the Impressionists shocked Paris with their rebellious Société Anonyme show. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/16/arts/design/impressionism-quiz.html">Test how well you know those once-revolutionary smudges</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Place on the National Mall: </strong>Here’s how the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/arts/womens-suffrage-national-monument.html">Women’s Suffrage National Monument</a>, which will be the Mall’s first monument dedicated to women’s history, overcame congressional and other roadblocks.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rebirth of the South’s ‘Iron Horse’: </strong>Exactly why the sculpture was attacked by University of Georgia students may always be a mystery. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/arts/design/iron-horse-sculpture-athens-georgia.html">But 70 years later, restored, it rides again</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Billboard Art as Activism</strong><strong>: </strong>The artist-run group For Freedoms tried to motivate voters by using billboards as a canvas. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/arts/design/artists-tried-to-activate-voters-with-billboard-art-did-it-work.html">Did it work?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>A Mysterious Donor</strong><strong>: </strong>Aso O.
