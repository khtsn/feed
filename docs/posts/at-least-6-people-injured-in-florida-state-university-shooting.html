I didn’t think it would happen here.”</p><p>Chris Coutts, 51, a professor of urban planning at the school, said he was “baffled” by what happened as he walked to his car after having sheltered in place. “This is the second one since I’ve been here,” he said, referring to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/us/florida-state-university-shooting.html" title="">2014 shooting</a> in which a gunman wounded three people in the library.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The F.B.I. in Jacksonville said in a <a href="https://nytnews.slack.com/archives/CP4J5TYNN/p1744909458012259?thread_ts=1744906043.386299&amp;cid=CP4J5TYNN" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement on social media</a> that it was assisting with the response.
