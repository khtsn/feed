Ukraine has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drones.html" title="">stepped up its own air attacks on Russian territory</a>, though on a smaller scale and with far fewer civilian deaths.</p><p>The overnight strikes underscored how months of diplomatic efforts to broker a cease-fire have failed to yield a breakthrough as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/world/europe/russia-ukraine-drones.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">dragged his feet</a> on agreeing to any temporary truce, adding conditions that he knows Ukraine will not accept. And after threatening for weeks to walk away from the negotiations, President Trump now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html?searchResultPosition=33" title="">appears to be doing exactly that</a>, telling President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine last week that Russia and Ukraine would have to find a solution to the war themselves.</p><p>Ukraine’s air force <a href="https://t.me/kpszsu/35037" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Sunday that Russia</a> had launched 69 ballistic and cruise missiles along with 298 attack drones, adding that about two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones were shot down. The air force spokesman, Yuriy Ihnat, said in an interview that it was the largest bombardment of the war in terms of the number of weapons used. Those numbers could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was the latest in a string of recent Russian attacks to involve swarms of more than 250 drones — a number unthinkable at the start of the war but now made possible by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/03/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-drones-deaths.html" title="">mass weapons production</a>.</p><p>Attacks involving swarms of drones are often designed to overwhelm the enemy’s air defenses. Ukraine’s are already stretched, and each consecutive attack adds further strain. The latest barrage also hit western and southern regions of Ukraine which, unlike the capital, Kyiv, are poorly protected by air defenses, increasing the likelihood of fatalities.</p><p>There was hope in Ukraine that the cease-fire talks that Mr. Trump initiated in February would at least ease air attacks on civilian areas. Instead, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">the violence has intensified</a>. Ukrainian civilian deaths have risen each month since February, <a href="https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28April%20%202025%29_ENG.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>, reaching 209 in April — one of the highest monthly tolls in two years.</p><p>Images and videos released by Ukraine’s emergency services captured the scale of the devastation on Sunday morning.</p><p>They showed firefighters spraying water on an apartment building in the <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43149" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">southern city of Mykolaiv</a> whose roof had been smashed, its shattered beams jutting into the sky like broken ribs. In the <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43176" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">village of Markhalivka</a>, outside Kyiv, emergency workers walked down a street where the houses on both sides were consumed by fire and debris covered the pavement. In the western <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43190" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zhytomyr region</a>, photos showed rescuers pulling the bodies of three children from houses that had been reduced to rubble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In addition to the casualties in Zhytomyr, four people were killed in the Kyiv region, four others in the western Khmelnytsky region and one in Mykolaiv, according to the local authorities.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, the village of Markhalivka was a scene of devastation. On the street where firefighters had battled multiple blazes earlier, residents now combed through the rubble of houses amid the smell of burning. About half the street was destroyed by what the police said were three missile strikes. Locals said a nearby military base may have been the target.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Firefighters spraying water on a destroyed building on a demolished block." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw/26int-ukraine-attack02a-photo-fgjw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/4fa5780a-f7f0-5185-a064-e5335542e090" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescue workers and firefighters in the village of Markhalivka on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Anzhelika Krasovets, 49, saw her home destroyed by the strike.

Blood from his son, who was seriously wounded in the back, stained the house’s floor. Their neighbor, however, did not make it out.

Last month, a strike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html" title="">near a playground</a> and another on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/ukraine-sumy-palm-sunday-russia-war.html" title="">crowded city center</a> killed 53 civilians, including several children.</p><p>Despite the ongoing fighting, throughout more than three years of war Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly exchanged prisoners — one of the few areas where the two sides have kept an open line of communication.</p><p>Hours after the air assault on Sunday, Russia and Ukraine said they had wrapped up a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-prisoner-swap.html" title="">major prisoner exchange</a> that began on Friday. Each side said that 303 more people had been released, bringing the total number of prisoners exchanged from each side to 1,000 — the largest swap of the war.</p><p>The agreement to exchange prisoners was the only concrete outcome from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">cease-fire negotiations held this month in Istanbul</a> — the first time the two sides have engaged in direct talks since the early months of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">the war</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>It was after those Istanbul talks that Mr. Trump signaled a readiness to step back. Following a phone call with Mr. Putin, he backed off his demand that Russia declare an immediate cease-fire and instead endorsed Mr. Putin’s call for direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.</p><p>For many Ukrainians, Russia’s professed commitment to cease-fire negotiations was little more than a tactic to string Mr. Trump along while continuing the fight.</p><p>Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V.
