Ukraine has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drones.html" title="">stepped up its own air attacks on Russian territory</a>, though on a smaller scale and with far fewer civilian deaths.</p><p>The overnight strikes underscored how months of diplomatic efforts to broker a cease-fire have failed to yield a breakthrough as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/world/europe/russia-ukraine-drones.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">dragged his feet</a> on agreeing to any temporary truce, adding conditions that he knows Ukraine will not accept. And after threatening for weeks to walk away from the negotiations, President Trump now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html?searchResultPosition=33" title="">appears to be doing exactly that</a>, telling President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine last week that Russia and Ukraine would have to find a solution to the war themselves.</p><p>Ukraine’s air force <a href="https://t.me/kpszsu/35037" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Sunday that Russia</a> had launched 69 ballistic and cruise missiles along with 298 attack drones, adding that about two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones were shot down. The air force spokesman, Yuriy Ihnat, said in an interview that it was the largest bombardment of the war in terms of the number of weapons used. Those numbers could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It was the latest in a string of recent Russian attacks to involve swarms of more than 250 drones — a number unthinkable at the start of the war but now made possible by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/03/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-drones-deaths.html" title="">mass weapons production</a>.<span>  </span></p><p>Attacks involving swarms of drones are often designed to overwhelm the enemy’s air defenses. Ukraine’s are already stretched, and each consecutive attack adds further strain. The latest barrage also hit western and southern regions of Ukraine which, unlike the capital, Kyiv, are poorly protected by air defenses, increasing the likelihood of fatalities.</p><p>There was hope in Ukraine that the cease-fire talks that Mr. Trump initiated in February would at least ease air attacks on civilian areas. Instead, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">the violence has intensified</a>. Ukrainian civilian deaths have risen each month since February, <a href="https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Ukraine%20-%20protection%20of%20civilians%20in%20armed%20conflict%20%28April%20%202025%29_ENG.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>, reaching 209 in April — one of the highest monthly tolls in two years.</p><p>Images and videos released by Ukraine’s emergency services captured the scale of the devastation on Sunday morning.</p><p>They showed firefighters spraying water on an apartment building in the <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43149" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">southern city of Mykolaiv</a> whose roof had been smashed, its shattered beams jutting into the sky like broken ribs. In the <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43176" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kyiv region</a>, emergency workers walked down a street where the houses on both sides were consumed by fire and debris covered the pavement. In the western <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43190" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zhytomyr region</a>, photos showed rescuers pulling the bodies of three children from houses that had been reduced to rubble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In addition to the casualties in Zhytomyr, four people were killed in the Kyiv region, four others in the western Khmelnytsky region and one in Mykolaiv, according to the local authorities.</p><p>A 73-year-old resident of the Khmelnytsky region, identified as Maria, <a href="https://t.me/suspilnekhmelnytskyi/26122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told local television</a> that her brother had been killed.</p><p>“They haven’t taken him out yet,” she told the news crew, pointing to a window of a damaged building. “There are other dead, too,” she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A resident inspecting his destroyed car in Odesa, Ukraine, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nina Liashonok/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, <a href="https://t.me/Klymenko_MVS/1431" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that</a> 13 regions had come under attack and that more than 60 people were injured. He added that more than 80 residential buildings were damaged.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky, who has accused the Kremlin of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-putin-truce.html" title="">playing for time</a> in peace negotiations, cited the attacks as further proof that “Russia is dragging out this war and continues to kill every day.” In a post on <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/14344" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>, he called for increased pressure on Mr. Putin.</p><p>“The world may go on a weekend break, but the war continues, regardless of weekends or weekdays,” Mr. Zelensky wrote. “This cannot be ignored. Silence of America, silence of others around the world only encourage Putin.”</p><p>Russia appears to have been increasingly targeting cities more intensively. Last month, a strike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/world/europe/ukraine-kryvyi-ri-attack.html" title="">near a playground</a> and another on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/europe/ukraine-sumy-palm-sunday-russia-war.html" title="">crowded city center</a> killed 53 civilians, including several children.</p><p>Despite the ongoing fighting, throughout more than three years of war Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly exchanged prisoners — one of the few areas where the two sides have kept an open line of communication.</p><p>Hours after the air assault on Sunday, Russia and Ukraine said they had wrapped up a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-prisoner-swap.html" title="">major prisoner exchange</a> that began on Friday. Each side said that 303 more people had been released, bringing the total number of prisoners exchanged from each side to 1,000 — the largest swap of the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The agreement to exchange prisoners was the only concrete outcome from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">cease-fire negotiations held this month in Istanbul</a> — the first time the two sides have engaged in direct talks since the early months of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">the war</a>.</p><p>It was after those Istanbul talks that Mr. Trump signaled a readiness to step back. Following a phone call with Mr. Putin, he backed off his demand that Russia declare an immediate cease-fire and instead endorsed Mr. Putin’s call for direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.</p><p>For many Ukrainians, Russia’s professed commitment to cease-fire negotiations was little more than a tactic to string Mr. Trump along while continuing the fight.</p><p>Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said last week that Moscow would present Kyiv with a draft document outlining its conditions for a peace deal after the prisoner exchange concluded, according to the <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/1027474" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russian news agency Interfax</a>.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, it was not immediately clear whether a document had been presented. But Ukrainian officials expect Russia to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html" title="">repeat demands made in Istanbul</a> — including that Ukraine withdraw from some territories it still controls — which are a non-starter for Kyiv.</p><p>Daria Mitiuk<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
