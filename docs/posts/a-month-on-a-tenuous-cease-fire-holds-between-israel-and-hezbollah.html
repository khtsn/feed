But a month on, there are concerns that the deal is not being implemented by either side in a timely manner.</p><p>As hundreds of thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/lebanon-ceasefire-return-home.html" title="">displaced Lebanese return home</a>, many are hoping the cease-fire will last, especially as their country grapples with a deep and prolonged economic crisis that was exacerbated by the war and years of political stagnation.</p><p>“We feel like we are coming back to life,” said Huda Hamzeh, whose fruit-and-vegetable stall in the capital, Beirut, has suffered from a lack of supply and fewer clients during the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We just want forever peace.”</p><p>Iran-backed Hezbollah was considerably weakened by the war. Securing the cease-fire required the group to make serious concessions, such as pulling its fighters and weapons back from a zone in southern Lebanon that borders Israel.</p><p>The truce took effect more than a year after Hezbollah began attacking Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in Gaza that led the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel retaliated by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">assassinating Hezbollah’s leadership</a> and pummeling the group’s bases.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
