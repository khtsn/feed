But a month on, there are concerns that the deal is not being implemented by either side in a timely manner.</p><p>As hundreds of thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/lebanon-ceasefire-return-home.html" title="">displaced Lebanese return home</a>, many are hoping the cease-fire will last, especially as their country grapples with a deep and prolonged economic crisis that was exacerbated by the war and years of political stagnation.</p><p>“We feel like we are coming back to life,” said Huda Hamzeh, whose fruit-and-vegetable stall in the capital, Beirut, has suffered from a lack of supply and fewer clients during the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We just want forever peace.”</p><p>Iran-backed Hezbollah was considerably weakened by the war. Securing the cease-fire required the group to make serious concessions, such as pulling its fighters and weapons back from a zone in southern Lebanon that borders Israel.</p><p>The truce took effect more than a year after Hezbollah began attacking Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in Gaza that led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Israel retaliated by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">assassinating Hezbollah’s leadership</a> and pummeling the group’s bases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mahmoud Farran, 29, and his neighbor Youssef Badawi, 12, clearing debris and shattered glass after returning home to their apartments in Tyre, Lebanon, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Shortly after the truce was announced, the Iran-backed alliance across the Middle East suffered another serious blow when the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted</a> by rebels. During Syria’s long civil war, Hezbollah had sent fighters to the neighboring country to defend Mr. al-Assad.

Gen. Tomer Bar, the commanding officer of the Israeli air force. Explaining the reason for the attack, he suggested that Hezbollah was testing Israel by trying to smuggle weapons in over the crossings.</p><p>Since the truce went into effect, the Israeli army has been conducting extensive operations in dozens of villages across southern Lebanon, saying it was dismantling tunnels, confiscating weapons and surveillance systems and <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1869400684853899752" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demolishing</a> a Hezbollah command center.</p><p>Lebanon’s foreign ministry filed an official complaint with the U.N. Security Council this week, saying Israel had launched more than 816 land and air attacks against Lebanon from Nov. 27 to Dec. 22. The violations “represent a serious threat to international efforts to achieve security in the region,” the ministry said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>More than 3,700 people in Lebanon were killed during the war and some 16,000 injured, according to the Lebanese health ministry, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.

Mr. Mikati has insisted the army is capable of securing the south and stabilizing the country.</p><p>But the Lebanese government is cash strapped, and observers say the army, which has long depended on donors, will need more support to bolster its presence in the south.</p><p>The army proved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/lebanon-army-ceasefire-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">unable to control Hezbollah</a> after the group’s monthlong war with Israel ended in 2006.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lebanese Army forces in the town of Khiam in southern Lebanon on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karamallah Daher/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>And while Hezbollah might remove its weapons from the south, it will be hard to uproot its fighters from the villages in the area, said Mounir Shehadeh, a retired general who previously oversaw the Lebanese government’s coordination with UNIFIL.</p><p>“How will they be expected to leave the region south of the Litani when it’s their towns and their properties?” Mr. Shehadeh said. “That wouldn’t make sense.”</p><p>The coming month will be a crucial test of whether the cease-fire can last more permanently.</p><p>For many Lebanese, the hope is that funds to support reconstruction efforts will soon be available. Mr. Mikati said this week that his Lebanese government was working with the World Bank, the European Union, Arab states and other countries to establish a fund to rebuild, especially in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/world/middleeast/lebanon-destruction.html" title="">obliterated villages across the south</a>.</p><p>General Lázaro said they were prioritizing road repairs, removing unexploded ordnance and expanding patrols so that more people could return home.</p><p>“The necessary long-term solutions are political,” he said. “There is ultimately no military solution.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abdi Latif Dahir is the East Africa correspondent for The Times, based in Nairobi, Kenya.
