He has pledged to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/business/energy-environment/trump-clean-energy-finance.html" title="">roll back investments in clean energy</a> that the Biden administration has prioritized.

Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/climate/davos-puts-climate-on-the-back-burner.html" title="">climate was on the back burner</a> at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. This year it will likely be the same, despite the efforts of some longtime environmental advocates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former Vice President Al Gore said he expected Donald J.

They’re trying to make sense of all these changes in the geopolitical environment. They’re trying to get a better grip on how fast generative A.I. is going to continue advancing. They’re worried about the Chinese economy. And they are looking for any clues to how they should interpret some of the hot statements that Donald Trump has been making.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Gore said he expected Mr. Trump to unleash a flurry of executive actions on his first day in office, including many that will target environmental protections.</p><p>“The fact that that first day is also the first day of Davos will make it interesting to say to say the least,” Mr. Gore said.</p><p>Mr. Benioff was more optimistic that Mr. Trump would prove willing to work with companies and other countries to tackle environmental issues.</p><p>Five years ago in Davos, during the final year of Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Benioff worked with the president to concoct <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/climate/trump-trees-climate-change.html" title="">a plan to plant one trillion trees</a>.</p><p>This year, he said, he was hoping to enlist Mr. Trump in an effort to protect the world’s oceans. Maritime temperatures around the globe have been inexplicably hot for more than a year now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/climate/coral-reefs-bleaching.html" title="">bleaching corals and baffling scientists</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>While humans have no easy way to dampen ocean heat, Mr. Benioff said it was also vitally important to enact new measures to reduce pollution and protect sea life.</p><p>“You have to find the issues that Trump will support,” Mr. Benioff said, adding that “fossil fuels are not the only environmental issue.”</p><p>Focusing on the need to reduce fossil emissions, he said, was a “moral hazard,” distracting from a broader range of concerns, including protecting nature and the oceans.</p><p>“I hope that oceans are something that we can get bipartisan support for,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Benioff said his efforts to work with the Biden administration on such an effort were rebuffed, and that he was holding out hope that Mr. Trump would be a willing partner.</p><p>“I tried very aggressively with the Biden administration,” Mr. Benioff said. “They failed to come in and support the oceans aggressively, and they showed very little interest in doing so. However, I have a case for optimism that Trump will support it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/climate/climate-change-environment-planet.html" title="">But climate change won’t be addressed with piecemeal solutions</a>. Instead, scientists have for decades maintained that the only way to halt runaway global warming is to drastically reduce the amount of planet-warming gases humans spew into the atmosphere each year.</p><p>Most of those emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels, which still account for the vast majority of the world’s energy production. And while the overall amount of renewable electricity is rising swiftly, global emissions are not yet falling.</p><p>Instead, as overall energy demand increases, and new technologies like artificial intelligence demand even more electricity, the amount of fossil fuel production is rising as well.</p><p>How the United States responds in a moment like this matters. If the incoming Trump administration were to accelerate its efforts to produce clean energy, the rest of the world might be more inclined to follow suit. But if the United States doubles down on fossil fuels, that could set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>“U.S. leadership is important,” said Nili Gilbert, the vice chairwoman of Carbon Direct, a company that helps corporations lower their emissions. “Other people say, ‘Well, if a country like the U.S. isn’t doing this, why should we?’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Some regions are more likely than others to continue efforts to ramp up solar and wind production even if the United States backs away from its climate goals.</p><p>For the last several years, during the war in Ukraine, the European Union has been trying to wean itself off Russian gas.</p><p>“I think the E.U. will look to stay true to its course,” Ms. Gilbert said. “This is an opportunity for them to stick to what they’ve committed and look to double down.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Melting icebergs near Ilulissat, Greenland.

China is both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/china-solar-energy-exports.html" title="">biggest installer of solar panels</a> and the biggest exporter of panels and parts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Benioff said he was also optimistic that relations between Washington and Beijing would improve under Mr. Trump, despite the saber rattling, trade disputes and tensions surrounding the sovereignty of Taiwan.</p><p>“I expect a much better relationship between the United States and China,” Mr. Benioff said, adding that he believed that China would continue to pursue its climate goals.</p><p>“They are on their way to being, I think, the first country that will be truly renewable,” he said. “They’ll be a massive leader of solar and wind and the deployment of these renewable technologies, and hopefully they will shutter their coal plants.”</p><p>While China is indeed embracing solar energy, it is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/climate/coal-plants-china.html" title="">the world’s largest consumer of coal</a>, which is among the dirtiest fossil fuels.</p><p>“There’s a lot of momentum behind clean energy, and that’s great, but not nearly enough to achieve our goals,” Mr. Bordoff said. At the end of the day, it will take coordinated efforts by nations around the globe, including the United States, to truly drive down emissions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“We need stronger government policy,” he said.</p><p>Companies are also walking back their climate goals. Two years ago, Davos was teeming with corporations touting their environmental, social and governance — or E.S.G. — bona fides. That term became shorthand for a commitment to reducing emissions, as well as other priorities, such as diversity goals.</p><p>But over the past year, after a pressure campaign from Republicans in the United States, many companies have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/business/esg-funds-withdrawals.html" title="">shied away from E.S.G. targets</a>.</p><p>“Trump is a part of this, but there’s a much bigger E.S.G. reality check,” Mr. Bordoff said. Instead, he said, “everything is going to be about A.I.”</p><p>Corporate leaders are giddy with enthusiasm about the prospects for artificial intelligence. In addition to increasing productivity, many say that A.I. may improve energy efficiency and help turbocharge the development of renewable power.</p><p>At the same time, powering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/artificial-intelligence-power-emissions.html" title="">the A.I. revolution is requiring huge amounts of new energy</a>, much of it powered by fossil fuels. By 2028, data centers could account for as much as 12 percent of the nation’s electricity, according to a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-new-report-evaluating-increase-electricity-demand-data-centers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new report</a> backed by the U.S. Department of Energy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>“There’s the amount of energy A.I. is going to need, and then there’s the use of A.I. as a tool in the energy sector, and these are competing forces,” Mr. Bordoff said. “But on balance, I’m optimistic that A.I. is going to do more good than harm to the energy transition.”</p><p>That is the sort of faith in markets that has defined Davos for decades, and it’s as true today — even with Trump and the rise of A.I. — as it ever was.</p><p>“Presidents change, but our values don’t change,” Mr. Benioff said. “We’re still focused on the same things. And you have to look for the opportunities based on whichever way the political world is swinging.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
