Mr. Bar wrote that he did not know all the reasons behind Mr. Netanyahu’s desire to terminate his services but that he had concluded that they did not stem from professional considerations, “but from an expectation of personal loyalty on my part toward the prime minister.”</p><p>Mr. Bar added that he had submitted the affidavit at the request of the court and out of a “heavy fear” for the ability of future heads of the Shin Bet to preserve the agency’s professionalism and independence.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office rebuffed Mr. Bar’s assertions, issuing a terse initial statement saying, “Ronen Bar submitted a false affidavit to the Supreme Court today that will soon be refuted in detail.”</p><p>In a longer statement, the prime minister’s office denied that the investigations led to Mr. Bar’s dismissal and rejected some of the other assertions in the affidavit. Mr. Netanyahu never requested that illegal measures be taken against protesters and only asked for the law to be enforced against protesters who used violence against government ministers and their families, the statement said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s critics seized on the affidavit as evidence that Mr. Netanyahu was endangering the security and character of the country.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office issued a terse statement Monday rebuffing Mr. Bar’s assertions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Moti Kimchi</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The affidavit of the head of the Shin Bet proves that Netanyahu is a danger to Israeli security and cannot continue to serve as prime minister,” Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the parliamentary opposition, said in a <a href="https://x.com/yairlapid/status/1914269237289365602" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video statement</a>.</p><p>Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of the Israeli military and the leader of the Democrats, a left-leaning party, described the affidavit as “a serious indictment and an emergency alarm call for Israeli democracy.”</p><p>The public affidavit came to just over seven pages in Hebrew. The court said Mr. Bar had submitted a 31-page classified version, with five appendices, providing more detail and documentation of his assertions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Bar did not go into any details over which Supreme Court cases could lead to a constitutional crisis. But experts say that a court ruling barring his dismissal, for example, could become a potential flashpoint, or a ruling disqualifying Mr. Netanyahu from continuing to serve as prime minister because of a conflict of interest.</p><p>Mr. Bar said he would soon announce a date for ending his term as Shin Bet chief. He had said long before Mr. Netanyahu’s decision to fire him that he would resign at an appropriate time as part of taking responsibility for his failures, and those of his agency, in not foreseeing and preventing the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that ignited the war in Gaza.</p><p>Despite that failure, Mr. Bar wrote, Mr. Netanyahu had praised the Shin Bet for successes in the battlefields of Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p>But things began to change in late 2024, Mr. Bar wrote in his affidavit. He listed a number of decisions he took between November 2024 and February 2025 that he believes led Mr. Netanyahu to view him as disloyal.</p><p>During that period, Mr. Bar said, he opened two sensitive investigations: one into an aide to the prime minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/world/middleeast/israel-document-leaks.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">suspected of leaking highly classified documents</a> stolen from the military to a foreign publication, and another one known as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-netanyahu.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Qatargate</a>,” a case hinging on suspicions that Mr. Netanyahu’s media advisers were paid by a representative of Qatar to promote that country’s interests in the Israeli news media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Qatari government has denied the allegations, saying in a statement that they served the agendas of those seeking to “undermine relations between nations.”</p><p>In addition, Mr. Bar said he had refused Mr. Netanyahu’s repeated requests to sign an opinion — drafted by Mr. Netanyahu or his aides — that would have prevented the prime minister’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/the-netanyahu-corruption-trial-explained.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">corruption trial</a> from going ahead, based on what he described as spurious security arguments.</p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- -->, <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
