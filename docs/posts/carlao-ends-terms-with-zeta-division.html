Some highlights of his time in FURIA include winning <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/535/champions-tour-brazil-stage-3-challengers-3" target="_blank">Stage 3: Challengers Brazil 3</a>, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/561/champions-tour-south-america-last-chance-qualifier" target="_blank">2021 South America LCQ</a>, and a back-to-back Champions appearance in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/449/valorant-champions-2021" target="_blank">2021</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1015/valorant-champions-2022" target="_blank">2022</a>. A tumultuous 2023 season saw Carlao and FURIA eventually ending their streak.</p>

<p>Carlao started his career as ZETA&#39;s head coach with a play-ins exit at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1924/champions-tour-2024-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">2024 VCT Pacific Kickoff</a>, and a group stage exit in both <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2002/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2005/champions-tour-2024-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> in the following months resulting in ZETA missing all international events and ended their Champions attendance record since 2022. In <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/448745/zeta-promotes-xqq-to-head-coach-parts-with-johnta" target="_blank">February 2025</a>, Carlao was moved to the assistant coach role for a returning <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6717/xqq">
		XQQ	</a>
</span>. The trend continues in the following season, where ZETA finished <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Kickoff</a> in 9th-12th place, followed with <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">Stage 2</a> in 9th-10th place.</p>

<p>During his time with ZETA, Carlao was credited with helping their Game Changers roster as well as their Academy team alongside his duties in the main roster.</p>

<p>Following his release, Carlao <a href="https://x.com/Carlao/status/1965672509636051001" target="_blank">has announced</a> that he is looking for opportunities in all VCT regions.</p>
