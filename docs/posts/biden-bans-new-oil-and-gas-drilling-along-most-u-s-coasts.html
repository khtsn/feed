Trump, who has heavy support from the oil and gas industry and has promised to expand drilling.</p><p>Mr. Biden also intends on Tuesday to announce two new national monuments in California, preserving more than 800,000 acres of ecologically fragile and culturally significant tribal lands.</p><p>Mr. Biden called it a climate imperative to block offshore drilling on about 20 percent of the nearly 3.2 billion acres of seabed controlled by the United States. He is relying on an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the <a href="https://www.boem.gov/ocs-lands-act-history/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act</a>, which he says gives him the authority for this executive order. The measure prevents new drilling along the entire Eastern Seaboard; the Pacific Coast along California, Oregon and Washington; in the eastern Gulf of Mexico; and in the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In many ways, the ban is symbolic. There has been almost no oil and gas exploration off California’s shores since an enormous oil spill near Santa Barbara in 1969 that shocked the nation. Drilling in Arctic federal waters is currently limited to a single facility in the Beaufort Sea. Mr. Trump himself imposed a 10-year moratorium on drilling along the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Florida when he was courting voters in those states during his re-election campaign in 2020. And the eastern Gulf of Mexico has been under some form of drilling moratorium since 2006.</p><p>“The relatively minimal fossil fuel potential in the areas I am withdrawing do not justify the environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling,” Mr. Biden said in a statement.</p><p>The executive order would not stop new drilling in the central and western areas of the Gulf of Mexico, some of which has been mandated by Congress. The Gulf produces nearly 15 percent of the nation’s oil and accounts for about 97 percent of U.S. offshore gas production.</p><p>“My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs,” Mr. Biden said.</p><p>“As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In his reasoning, he also invoked the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, in which a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, killing 11 workers and causing the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Mr. Biden called it “a solemn reminder of the costs and risks of offshore drilling.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, who mocks global warming, has promised to erase Mr. Biden’s climate policies, withdraw the United States from the global fight to prevent the planet from overheating and grant the oil industry virtually unrestricted access to America’s public lands and waters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An oil-covered pelican near the Gulf of Mexico in Plaquemines Parish, La., after the Deepwater Horizon spill, in 2010.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gerald Herbert/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Monday Mr. Trump called Mr. Biden’s move “ridiculous” and said he would revoke the ban.</p><p>“I’ll unban it immediately,” he said on the Hugh Hewitt radio program.</p><p>The United States is currently <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">producing</a> more oil than any nation at any time in history. It is also the world’s largest producer of gas, as well as the leading exporter of liquefied natural gas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Biden campaigned for the presidency on a promise to end new drilling on federal lands and waters.</p><p>But the courts and Congress thwarted that plan. Mr. Biden approved an $8 billion oil project in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska known as Willow, and as part of a deal to win votes for a climate law, he allowed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>Still, he has permitted the fewest offshore lease sales in history — allowing just three over the next five years — and has blocked drilling and mining in areas of Alaska, Wyoming, Nevada and elsewhere.</p><p>Representative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, is one of several Democrats who have urged Mr. Biden to restrict drilling. He said Monday that the fight had “paid off.”</p><p>“This is a common sense win for everyone who relies on clean, thriving oceans,” Mr.Pallone said. “Protecting our coastal waters from oil drilling safeguards our fishing and tourism economy and critically-endangered North Atlantic right whales.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Preventing new drilling might also reduce the burning of fossil fuels that produce the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, environmental groups said.</p><p>The International Energy Agency has found that new oil and gas development must stop if the world is to stay within safe limits of global warming. Nearly every nation on the planet agreed in 2015 to limit warming from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above levels before the Industrial Revolution. The planet has already warmed at least 1.1 degrees Celsius. The year that just ended was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/2024-temperatures-hottest-year.html" title="">the hottest in recorded</a> history.</p><p>Mark S. Davis, director of the Center for Environmental Law at Tulane University in New Orleans, called the ban a “big deal.” Coastal communities live under the periodic threat that drilling suspensions could be lifted, and a permanent ban promises long-term confidence, particularly for the tourism and fishing industries.</p><p>“President Biden is drawing the line and saying, if you will, that the era of uncertainty is over and I’m closing the door to exploration and production in these areas,” Mr. Davis said.</p><p>Oil and gas executives said Mr. Biden’s ban could be disastrous for the industry’s future.</p><p>“With global demand continuing to rise, there’s always uncertainty about where the supply is going to continue to come from,” said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore oil, gas and wind producers. “You don’t want to take options off the table where it could bolster our economic and national security. It’s about making sure we have a well thought-out, long term energy policy that gives us the flexibility to adjust when the demand scenario requires it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The ban would not affect the offshore wind industry, which the Biden administration has strongly supported.</p><p>Mr. Milito called the ban “patently political.”</p><p>Ron Neal, the chairman of the offshore committee of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, an oil and gas trade group, called the ban “significant and catastrophic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A worker walking through the oil processing area of Shell’s Appomattox oil platform in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s promised repeal could be challenged by environmental groups, and several legal experts said there was a strong chance that Mr. Biden’s ban could survive.</p><p>While section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act gives the president wide leeway to bar drilling, it does not include language that would allow any president to revoke a ban.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Trump has already tried and failed to repeal such a prohibition. In 2015, President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/obama-plan-calls-for-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-the-atlantic.html" title="">banned offshore drilling</a> in about 98 percent of federally owned Arctic waters as well as 3.8 million acres of the Atlantic Ocean home to unique deepwater corals and rare fish.</p><p>Mr. Trump repealed the order and environmental groups, led by the nonprofit Earthjustice, sued. In 2019, a Federal District Court judge in Alaska ruled that the ban <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/climate/trump-oil-drilling-arctic.html" title="">could not be undone</a> without an act of Congress.</p><p>“It’s unquestionably within Biden’s powers to do this and there’s a big legal question about whether Trump can undo it ,” said Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.</p><p>While the case could be a powerful precedent for Mr. Biden, others noted that it was never fully resolved.</p><p>The Trump administration appealed. But then Mr. Biden won the 2020 election. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to dismiss the case and Mr. Biden’s administration reissued Mr. Obama’s bans. Moreover, some lawyers argue that the Alaska ruling applies only to that state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I would view it as an unsettled issue and certainly one that the new administration will continue to pursue,” said Ann D. Navaro, a partner at Bracewell, a law firm that advises energy clients.</p><p>Republicans, who will control both chambers in the new Congress, might also try to amend the 1953 law to allow presidents to reverse the drilling bans of their predecessors.</p><p>That, however, would require a at least 60 votes in the Senate to clear procedural hurdles, which would be challenging with Republicans holding just a three-seat majority.</p><p>The party also could try to use an upcoming budget reconciliation process to require the Interior Department to offer leases in the areas covered by the ban. That would require only a simple majority.</p><p>But Mr. Davis said Republicans from coastal states seem unlikely to support such a move.</p><p>“A mandate would require the congressional delegation in Florida, in the Carolinas, to say yes. And they’ve never done that, as President Trump found out when he initially proposed opening up those states,” Mr. Davis said, noting how Mr. Trump in 2018 tried to open all American waters to drilling but faced an immediate backlash from his own party and quickly walked back his effort.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He called the protests of the oil industry “theater.”</p><p>“It’s their job to want to be able to go wherever they want when they want,” Mr. Davis said. But, he added, of the areas banned by Mr. Biden: “They don’t really expect to go there. There is no pressure to ‘drill, baby, drill’ in any of these areas.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lisa Friedman is a Times reporter who writes about how governments are addressing climate change and the effects of those policies on communities.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman">More about Lisa Friedman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
