    <h1>Israelis Take to Streets Day After Strikes on Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Israelis were gathering on Wednesday outside the Parliament building in Jerusalem to protest moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that they say undermine the country’s democracy and to call for a renewed cease-fire deal for Gaza to bring the remaining hostages there home.</p><p>The convergence of popular anger over both domestic and national security issues comes after Israel carried out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-hamas.html" title="">deadly aerial attacks</a> across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, ending a temporary truce with Hamas that began in January.</p><p>The broad sense of national solidarity that had surrounded the war in Gaza, set off on Oct. 7, 2023, by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, now appears to be fraying.</p><p>There are growing accusations in Israel that Mr. Netanyahu’s priorities are his political survival and of bolstering his right-wing government ahead of a crucial budget vote later this month.</p><p>Protesters closed down the main highway into Jerusalem during the morning hours as they marched into the city in scenes reminiscent of the social and political upheaval that roiled the country in the months before the war over government plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-judiciary-crisis-explainer.html" title="">curb the powers of the judiciary</a>. </p><p>At the time, Israeli security chiefs and experts said the internal strife had contributed to Israel’s vulnerability and encouraged its enemies.</p><p>Protests were initially called for Wednesday after Mr. Netanyahu announced that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-firing.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">moving to dismiss the head of Israel’s domestic intelligence agency</a>, citing a lack of personal trust between them. </p><p>That has raised public concerns about the government’s renewed push to reduce the power of state watchdogs and make appointments that critics say are based on loyalty.</p><p>The centrist leader of Israel’s parliamentary opposition, Yair Lapid, called on people to join the protests in a social media <a href="https://x.com/yairlapid/status/1902244460802568616" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on Wednesday morning.</p><p>“This government does not stop at red,” he wrote. “The only solution is unity, not silent, submissive, or fake unity, but the unity of an entire nation coming together and saying: Enough!” He added, “This is our moment, our future, our country. Take to the streets!”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu said that the surprise attack on Gaza on Tuesday was the opening salvo in a campaign to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages after weeks of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-cease-fire-assess.html" title="">fruitless negotiations via mediators</a>. </p><p>From now on, he said, Israel would increase its military action against Hamas and negotiations would take place “only under fire.”</p><p>Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.</p></div></div>
