                    <p>Bounty was reduced to 16 teams and moved fully to LAN</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>BLAST has announced details for its 2027 circuit, unveiling several changes made to its tournament and financial incentive structure.</p>
                  <h2>Bounty undergoes revamp</h2>
                  <p>The Bounty, which opens each season, underwent the biggest revamp, moving from a 32-team tournament played online until the top-eight stage, to a 16-team one played fully on LAN.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, just like Open, Bounty will feature 12 direct VRS invites and four regional qualifiers in Europe, North and South America and Asia, each inviting four teams to comply with Valve&#39;s requirement to invite at least 20 teams to tier-one events.</p>
                  <p>The Open and Rivals formats remain unchanged. BLAST previously announced that the 2027 circuit would feature three Open and one Rivals tournament, after it was no longer granted an exception by Valve to host two wildcard-type Rivals events without fulfilling the requirements to do so.</p>
                  <p><strong>BLAST&#39;s 2027 events</strong></p>

                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>BLAST also announced its first location for the year, Rio de Janeiro, where the third Open tournament will take place in the first half of October. The event will mark the organizer&#39;s return to Brazil for the first time since 2019&#39;s BLAST Pro Series Sao Paulo.</p>
                  <h2>Year-long investment up to $10 million</h2>
                  <p>Another key change to the circuit is the increase of BLAST&#39;s total investment for the year to $10 million, up from $8.5 million in 2025 and 2026, and the incentive structure.</p>
                  <p>The investment will be split into four categories:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Prizemoney:</strong> $3 million</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Team Payment (aka club share):</strong> $4.5 million</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Acceptance Fees:</strong> $1.8 million</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Team Experience:</strong> $0.7 million</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Compared to previous years, BLAST is moving away from its year-long incentive structure, the Frequent Flyer Programme. Instead, it will reward teams entirely per event.</p>
                  <p>Each event will feature a $1.25 million prize purse counting towards the Valve Regional Standings (VRS), split between prizemoney and a team payment, otherwise known as club share.</p>
                  <p>A total of $1.8 million will be spread between the six events as acceptance fees, which will be based on their standing on the VRS at the time of invitation, a mechanic BLAST previously used in 2025.</p>
                  <p>Finally, BLAST reserved a total of $700,000 for a so-called &#34;team experience investment,&#34; which will go towards &#34;improved lodgings at events and travel conditions to events to reduce the travel strain a dense global calendar creates.&#34;</p>
                  <h2>Under more pressure than ever before</h2>
                  <p>BLAST&#39;s increased investment is a clear message to the teams that it is hoping to remain one of the biggest organizers in the Counter-Strike space.</p>
                  <p>In 2027, that status will come under more pressure than ever before due to four of its events clashing with a PGL gunning for a bigger piece of the pie ever since its return to the scene in 2025.</p>
                  <p>With a change to a per-event financial structure rather than one that heavily disincentivized teams from skipping their events, BLAST has seemingly accepted that position.</p>
                  <p>PGL and ESL have yet to reveal their financial investments or details about individual tournaments for 2027.</p>
