That could be a foreboding political sign for a president who campaigned on improving the economy — not on tanking it.</p><p>For Musk, the bad news centered on Tesla: Amid falling sales and growing protests over his role in the White House, the company’s shares <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/10/us/president-trump-news#tesla-stock-market-elon-musk" title="">slid</a> to their lowest point since before Election Day. By the afternoon, they had fallen more than 15 percent for the day.</p><p>Musk is no stranger to white-knuckling his way through adversity. After he paid $44 billion to buy Twitter, the company’s value slid dramatically as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/business/x-elon-musk-advertisers.html" title="">advertisers</a> and users fled the platform (it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/technology/elon-musk-x-debt-sale.html" title="">ticked up</a> somewhat because of his association with Trump). Tesla nearly went bankrupt earlier in its history, and Musk thought SpaceX might go under after a series of failed launches between 2006 and 2008. He considers high-profile mistakes, like failed rocket launches, to be part of the process. Reward requires risk.</p><p>“We don’t want to design to eliminate every risk,” he said, according to Walter Isaacson, who wrote a biography about Musk. “Otherwise we will never get anywhere.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In recent days, Trump has sounded a little bit as if he were trying to assume Musk’s tolerance for pain. He has said that tariffs could cause a “little disturbance” to the economy, and acknowledged the possibility of a “period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”</p><p>To put it in Muskian terms, Trump seemed to be suggesting that he might have to blow up a rocket or two before getting the economy to take off the way he insists it will.</p><p>But the economy is not something that presidents — who generally want to keep their voters happy — are typically inclined to break and fix later. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/trump-tv-stock-market.html" title="">long feared the political impact</a> when markets careen the way they have today.</p><p>The question now may be whether or not he is willing to tolerate the pain, like Musk, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/economy/trump-tariffs-exceptions.html" title="">whether he decides</a> to bring his trade war back down to earth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Musk made a show of making amends. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>MEANWHILE on X</p><h2 id="link-d0e3ed5">Making nice</h2><p><em>For Musk, his X account is a megaphone. My colleague Kate Conger explains how he used it today to suggest he and the secretary of state have patched things up.</em></p><p>After a clash with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week at a cabinet meeting, Musk and Rubio were making nice on X.</p><p>And exchange of public compliments was an effort to quiet tensions over Musk’s gutting of the United States Agency for International Development, a part of the State Department, and Rubio’s attempt to reassert control over his domain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The debate became so heated that the two quarreled in front of Trump and the cabinet last week, my colleagues Jonathan Swan and Maggie Haberman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-power.html" title="">reported</a>.</p><p>On Monday, however, Musk and Rubio claimed to be over it. Rubio posted on his X account about deep budget cuts to the U.S.A.I.D., saying that 83 percent of its programs had been terminated and giving Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency credit.</p><p>“Thank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff,” he said.</p><p>Musk responded politely: “Tough, but necessary. Good working with you.”</p><p>Musk didn’t settle all his issues with cabinet members, though.</p><p>The billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy at last week’s meeting. Duffy complained that Musk’s team was pressing him to fire air traffic controllers in the wake of several plane crashes.</p><p>On Saturday, Musk unfollowed Duffy on X.</p><p>— <!-- -->Kate Conger</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Tesla Cybertruck outside Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach, Fla., last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>THE GOOD NEWS FOR TESLA</p><h2 id="link-24ef3103">How Trump’s tariffs could help Tesla</h2><p><em>Even though Musk’s prominent role in the Trump White House appears to have hurt Tesla’s sales and stock price, the administration’s policies </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/asia/trump-trade-musk-tesla.html" title=""><em>stand to benefit the company in a different way</em></a><em>.

G.M. and Ford build many of their electric models in Mexico. Tesla is also less dependent on batteries and other components from overseas. While Tesla wouldn’t be immune to trade conflict, rivals would probably be forced to jack up prices much more than Tesla to pay for tariffs.</p><p>That would give Tesla, which has been suffering from an aging model lineup, a much-needed competitive advantage.</p><p>But Trump’s affinity for tariffs presents risks for Tesla, too. The company’s biggest factory is in Shanghai, producing cars for the Chinese market and for export to Europe and other regions. As China retaliates with tariffs on U.S. goods, Tesla could be caught in the crossfire.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/asia/trump-trade-musk-tesla.html" title=""><em>Read more here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>— <!-- -->Jack Ewing</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-17"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>you shouldn’t miss</p><h2 id="link-2f9a0ab8">Musk is shaping politics, not just government</h2><p>The country has never before seen an unelected billionaire and newcomer to electoral politics gain such a powerful and prominent perch in the White House.
