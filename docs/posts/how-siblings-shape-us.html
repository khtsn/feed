    <h1>How Siblings Shape Us</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Happy Mother’s Day. The cover story in today’s Times Magazine begins with an idea: While parents work hard to mold their offspring, those offspring just as often mold each other. Susan Dominus, who has written many moving pieces about children and families, looks at a growing field of research to see how kids’ personalities “spill over” onto their siblings. It’s not always the way you’d think.</p><p>As the father of three boys (and as a sibling myself), I was rapt. You should read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/magazine/siblings-families-parents-influence.html" title="">the story</a>. In today’s newsletter, I ask Susan a few questions about her findings.</p><p><strong>What got you interested in this story?</strong></p><p>My older brother was extremely influential in my own life. When I was 14, and he was home on a break from college, he talked me into starting a school newspaper. He somehow knew before I did (and definitely before my parents did) what kind of work I would love doing. When I started interviewing people about the way their families influenced their lives, I was struck by how often siblings played a pivotal role in their careers — in making an introduction, giving a key piece of advice, setting the bar high.</p><p><strong>You tell the story of several high-achieving families. But the phenomenon isn’t necessarily strongest among the privileged, is it?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Not at all. If anything, research suggests that what’s known as the “sibling spillover effect” (a measure of how much siblings influence each other, especially academically) is more powerful in disadvantaged families. In those families, the bond can be more influential — the siblings spend a lot of time together, either because their parents are so busy working, or because the family doesn’t have the resources to spend on tons of extracurriculars.</p><p><strong>My kids have wildly different personalities. Tell me what the research shows about birth-order psychology — the idea that your place among siblings shapes you?</strong></p><p>Most personality researchers will tell you that the qualities we associate with birth order don’t hold up in the best-conducted studies with the widest samples. Oldest children are not, for example, the most conscientious. They likely just seem that way because, as children, they were always the farthest along developmentally. Compared with the general population — and even compared with their own siblings at the same age — the oldest children are not unusually diligent or responsible.</p><p><strong>As a first child, I reject this finding.</strong></p><p>As the youngest child, I embrace it.</p><p><strong>But why does some research say that more competitive athletes are younger siblings?</strong></p><p>First-born children — who enjoy a brief window as only children, with plenty of enrichment — have a cognitive edge over their younger siblings, the research consistently shows. (The studies also compare them to their siblings when they reach the same age.) Some researchers theorize that younger children naturally gravitate toward a niche like sports to find a domain that they can conquer and call their own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>One thing that freaked me out is that even attentive, well-meaning parents are sometimes poor judges of their own kids.</strong></p><p>Parents can make assessments about which of their children is the “academic” one — assessments that are not, in fact, accurate — that affect the grades their kids get and the extracurricular choices those kids make. The sibling they’ve decided is academically better then increasingly outstrips the others.</p><p><strong>I will endeavor to withhold judgment!</strong></p><p>Good luck with that!</p><p><strong>In addition to sibling relationships, you get into genetic determinants in your new book, “The Family Dynamic,” from which this story is adapted. What can genes tell us?</strong></p><p>The binary idea of genes versus the environment is too simplistic. People’s genetic inclinations elicit responses from the world that in turn shape their personalities and outcomes. And people’s genetic influences also likely lead them to certain environments — if available to them — that reinforce their natural leanings. Where do parenting choices fit into all of that? The answer is: less than most parents probably think.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/magazine/siblings-families-parents-influence.html" title=""><em>I recommend you read Susan’s story</em></a><em> about siblings and how they shape each other.</em></p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-14c771fd">India-Pakistan Conflict</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Celebrations in Pakistan. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Akram Shahid/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><ul><li><p>India and Pakistan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/world/asia/india-pakistan-conflict.html" title="">declared a cease-fire</a> after four days of escalating cross-border attacks.

It’s a difficult time for the dating app industry, a difficult time for human connection, and a difficult time for women in tech. We talked about all of it.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>You had a lot of growth during the pandemic when everyone was stuck on their apps. You go public in 2021, ring the bell, baby on your hip, and the very next year user growth starts to slow down. What do you think was happening?</strong></p><p>My <em>opinion</em> is that I ran this company for the first several years as a quality over quantity approach. A telephone provider came to us early on. They said, “We love your brand, we want to put your app preprogrammed on all of our phones and when people buy our phones, your app will be on the home screen, and you’re going to get millions of free downloads.” I said, “Thank you so much but no thank you.” Nobody could understand what in the world I was doing, and I said it’s the wrong way to grow.</p><p>This is not a social network, this is a double-sided marketplace. One person gets on and they have to see someone that is relevant to them. You’re not going to walk down the streets of New York City and want to meet every single person you pass. Why would you assume that someone would want to do that on an app? What happened was, in the pandemic and throughout other chapters, growth was king. It was hailed as the end all be all.</p><p><strong>You’re talking about the expectations from investors as one of the reasons this was a difficult period, but Gen Z grew up with the apps, and the data says they are very much over them. Seventy-nine percent report dating-app fatigue.</strong></p><p>I think the reason Gen Z has abandoned the apps is because they’re getting on the apps and they’re not seeing who they want to see and they’re feeling two things, which I take full accountability for at Bumble. They’re feeling rejected and they’re feeling judged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Armando Rafael for The New York Times.
