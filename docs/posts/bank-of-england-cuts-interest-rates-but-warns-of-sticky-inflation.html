The rate cut on Thursday was the second since August, before which rates had been held at a 16-year high for about a year.</p><p>“We need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can’t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,” Andrew Bailey, the governor of the central bank, said in a statement.</p><p>But, he added, if the economy evolved as policymakers expected, then rates “will continue to fall gradually from here.” One member of the nine-person rate-setting committee had voted to hold rates at 5 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Policymakers have taken a cautious approach to cutting interest rates, even as inflation dropped to 1.7 percent in September, notably below the central bank’s 2 percent target.</p><p>There are expectations that inflation will climb back above target in the next few months as gas and electricity prices increase. Several central bank officials have highlighted the risk that inflationary pressures have not been completely stamped out, making it hard to keep inflation at target in the long run.</p><p>The Bank of England’s decision on Thursday came as investors and governments around the world prepared for the potential implications of the second presidency of Donald J. Trump. Although there is uncertainty about what policies Mr. Trump will enact, he has proposed higher import tariffs that would likely rock the global economy.</p><p>Central bankers will be alert to effect of higher yields on government bonds, which have jumped since the election result and tightened financing conditions, and the prospects of stronger inflation imported by their currencies weakening against the dollar.</p><p><em>This is a breaking news story.
