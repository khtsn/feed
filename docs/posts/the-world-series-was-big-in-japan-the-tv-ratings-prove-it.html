Mizuno turned on the TV in his bar, Otoko Bar Mizuno Sake Store, and his regulars watched Ohtani win his first World Series, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5886987/2024/10/30/dodgers-win-world-series-yankees/" title="">the Dodgers beat the Yankees, 7-6</a>, in Game 5.</p><p>“The entire country is thrilled,” Mizuno said, as a banner of Ohtani as tall as his bar hung outside the entrance.</p><p>Japan has loved baseball for decades, but Ohtani’s appearances in the World Series alongside his Japanese teammate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5875523/2024/10/27/yankees-dodgers-world-series-yoshinobu-yamamoto/" title="">Yoshinobu Yamamoto</a> elevated the games to soaring levels of popularity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>About 15.2 million television viewers in Japan watched each of the first two games of the World Series on average, compared with 14.5 million in the United States, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/press-release/release-nearly-30-million-average-viewers-in-u-s-japan-for-first-2-world-series-games" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Major League Baseball</a>.</p><p>In Japan, the World Series games began at 9 a.m., so people watched over breakfast or during their workdays.

After another outstanding regular season, he went just 2-for-19 in the World Series, failing to get on base in Game 5. He also injured his shoulder in Game 2.</p><p>Japanese fans watched his every move anyway.</p><p>“Ohtani sells,” said Jim Allen, who has covered Japanese baseball for Kyodo News since 2012, adding that Kyodo’s English-language articles about the player were about six times as popular as other articles. “The networks that were broadcasting the World Series games are basically doing nonstop Ohtani coverage.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the Tokyo headquarters of Nishikawa, a bedding company that Ohtani promotes, about a hundred employees surrounded a TV screen near the office’s entrance to watch the final inning of Game 5, said Yuna Mori, a company spokeswoman.</p><p>“He’s put together an unprecedented season, so everybody’s watching,” said John Gibson, a Japanese-to-English interpreter who lived in Japan for 30 years.</p><p>“I imagine the bosses are coming in and putting the TV on themselves and holding the remote,” he added.</p><p>It’s no surprise that Japan is watching a lot of baseball. When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/sports/baseball/shohei-ohtani-world-baseball-classic.html" title="">Ohtani led Japan</a> to the championship at last year’s World Baseball Classic in Miami, more than 42 percent of Japanese households watched their country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/sports/baseball/japan-usa-world-baseball-classic.html" title="">defeat the United States</a> during the workday on a Wednesday.</p><p>M.L.B. has taken notice. It will <a href="https://www.mlb.com/international/events/tokyo-series" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open the 2025 season</a> with the Dodgers playing the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo. The Dodgers played the San Diego Padres in this year’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/world/asia/mlb-baseball-south-korea-fans.html" title="">season opener in Seoul</a>, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/world/asia/ohtani-japan-south-korea.html" title="">Ohtani drew massive crowds</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Japanese broadcasters are aware, too.
