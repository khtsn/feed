She grabbed a few bottles of “Perfect in Pink” body cream, stuffed a pink, bow-shaped makeup bag under her arm and headed to the checkout line.</p><p>One small data point for the retailer’s big holiday bet.</p><p>Every year, Bath &amp; Body Works releases 250 new fragrances, but it puts muscle behind just a few, like “Perfect in Pink,” that it expects to carry the holiday shopping season.</p><p>This is a crucial time of year for most retailers, but Bath &amp; Body Works, which sells some $7.4 billion of lotions, perfumes and candles each year, especially benefits from the gift-giving imperative of the season. In 2023, the company, the mass-market stalwart of scent purveyors with 1,850 stores in the United States and Canada and 510 more in over 40 other countries, reaped 66 percent of its total net income toward the end of the year.

The aromatic concoction wafts from three-wick candles, hand cream, glossy lip oils, pocket-size hand sanitizer containers and a $69.95 glass bottle of eau de parfum, packaged in a hot pink bow-shaped box; 29 products in all.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
