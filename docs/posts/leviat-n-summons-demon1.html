However, the year would not play out so favorably for them, as they fell far below what was expected of them. In <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1923/champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff/playoffs" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>, they were <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/303088/nrg-esports-vs-sentinels-champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff-sf" target="_blank">eliminated</a> in the semi-finals by <span data-ref-id="7">

</span>, and failed to qualify for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1921/champions-tour-2024-masters-madrid" target="_blank">Masters Madrid</a>. In <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2004/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-1/regular-season" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>, they would miss playoffs with a 3-3 record, being blown out and embarrassed in their losses. Their lack of an experienced IGL was proving a major issue and one they would need to solve going into Stage 2. As a result, Demon1 was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/352708/nrg-bench-demon1-release-marved" target="_blank">benched</a> in order to make room for <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/817/finesse">
		FiNESSE	</a>
</span> to take the reins of the roster and attempt to salvage NRG&#39;s year. Demon1 would remain on the bench for the rest of the season until he was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/412233/nrg-releases-demon1" target="_blank">released</a> shortly after the transfer window opened.</p>

<p>Similarly to NRG, Leviatán was also touted as somewhat of an international super-team, also having two world champions in <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8480/aspas">
		aspas	</a>
</span> and C0M, as well as strong existing pieces from their previous roster. Also mirroring NRG, they would miss Masters Madrid when they too were <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/295614/leviat-n-vs-sentinels-champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff-decider-b" target="_blank">eliminated</a> by Sentinels in the group stage of Kickoff. However, unlike NRG, Leviatán were able to learn from their losses and become a top team in Americas. Across stages <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2004/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-1/regular-season" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2095/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-2/regular-season" target="_blank">two</a>, they only lost one regular season match to <span data-ref-id="10">

	<div data-post-id="4206618">
		
		
		<p>omg no the flag has nothing to do with citizenship, region or country of residence its just his ethnicity at keast in the case of demon1 like FNS could technically use a flag of Tanzania if he wants to but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s an import he&#39;s only an import if his main region in which he plays in is different which is not represented by his flag</p>
