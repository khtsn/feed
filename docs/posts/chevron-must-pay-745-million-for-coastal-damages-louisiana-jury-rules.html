Moreover, it said that the regulations that went into effect in 1980 did not apply to oil and gas activity that began earlier.</p><p>The jury, after a four-week trial, awarded Plaquemines Parish $575 million to compensate for land loss, $161 million to compensate for contamination and $8.6 million for abandoned equipment. Chevron said it would appeal the verdict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This verdict is just one step in the process to establish that the 1980 law does not apply to conduct that occurred decades before the law was enacted,” Mike Phillips, the lead trial lawyer for Chevron, said in a statement on Saturday. “Chevron is not the cause of the land loss occurring in Breton Sound.”</p><p>Louisiana’s state government, while usually friendly to the oil and gas industry, took the side of Plaquemines in the lawsuit, as the state struggles to reverse vast coastal land loss.</p><p>The state has lost more than <a href="https://midbasin.coastal.la.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2,000 square miles</a>, about the land area of Delaware, because of sea level rise and the loss of sediment that a free-flowing Mississippi River used to leave behind along the coast, until the river was constrained by levees built for flood control.</p><p>The loss in Plaquemines Parish, which is 10 miles downriver of New Orleans, is particularly acute.</p><p>The parish <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/21/magazine/louisiana-coast-engineering.html" title="">has been reduced</a> by nearly half its original size in the last century. Oil-and-gas canals crisscross its wetlands, exacerbating seawater destruction of marsh vegetation. The state has taken aggressive countermeasures.</p><p>Louisiana has enacted a 50-year, $50 billion coastal master plan to try to save what it can from the rising Gulf of Mexico. The plan includes 124 projects designed to dredge sand, rebuild degraded marshes, and add levees, floodgates and storm surge barriers. It aims to create tens of thousands of acres of new land, preserve what land remains and protect the coast from hurricanes and sea-level rise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The state received billions of dollars from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/us/accord-reached-settling-lawsuit-over-bp-oil-spill.html" title="">settlement</a> of lawsuits stemming from the 2010 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/climate/deepwater-horizon-anniversary.html" title="">Deepwater Horizon</a> oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which was the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adeel Hassan is a reporter and editor on the National Desk.
