                        <p>The Windsor Hotel in Istanbul has cancelled their contract as the venue for the debut February 16-18, $10,000, <a href="https://www.mcs-tournaments.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Masters Championship Series</a> event, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/coach/3769/mithr" data-tooltip-id="uid1543304750">Torbjørn <span>&#34;⁠mithR⁠&#34;</span> Nyborg</a> has revealed, after no payment was received from the TO.</p>
                        <p>&#34;As a team that needs to apply for visa for most tournaments,&#34; <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/10245/jijiehao" data-tooltip-id="uid927751225">JiJieHao</a> coach <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/coach/3769/mithr" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1543304750">mithR</a> explained, &#34;we felt that the opportunity of attending 2 VRS tournaments in the same city [the other being <a href="https://istanbulan.gg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Istanbulan</a> a few days before] was a chance we had to take.&#34;</p>
                        <p>&#34;This morning we got contacted by the hotel again who said that they did not receive payment from the TO, despite being sent (a fake) payment receipt. Therefore the hotel and venue has decided to cancel the contract with the TO.</p>
                        <p>&#34;We were aware of the risk. Unfortunate. Lesson learned.&#34; <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/coach/3769/mithr" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1543304750">mithR</a> also added that <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/10245/jijiehao" data-tooltip-id="uid927751225">JiJieHao</a> had paid 50% of the tournament&#39;s $799 entry fee.</p>
