		<p>Riot has <a href="https://x.com/vct_emea/status/2021962526544593127" target="_blank">announced</a> that the final weekend of VCT EMEA Stage 2 will be heading to Barcelona. This marks the first time that VCT EMEA will leave its basecamp in Berlin and host an event in a major venue.</p>

<p>The Stage 2 finals will be held from August 28-30 at the Olimpic Arena in Badalona, part of the greater Barcelona metropolitan area. The arena, built in 1992 for the Barcelona Olympic Games, is a multi-sport arena primarily used for basketball. Its capacity of over 12,000 greatly outnumbers the 210-seat capacity at the Riot Games Arena, where VCT EMEA matches are currently held.</p>

<p>This year&#39;s Stage 2 events will look different globally. Four of the region&#39;s best Challengers teams will compete in the Stage 2 play-ins, competing against the region&#39;s remaining eight VCT teams for four spots in the playoffs. </p>

<p>With four of the region&#39;s best Challengers teams having the opportunity to earn a spot in the Stage 2 play-ins, Tier 2 teams have the opportunity to compete in the Stage 2 playoffs and earn a spot at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2766/valorant-champions-2026" target="_blank">Champions Shanghai</a>.</p>

<p>“Bringing a major live event to fans has been a long-term focus for the team, so we&#39;re really excited to host the Stage 2 Finals in Spain later this year,” said Daniel Ringland, Head of VALORANT Esports, EMEA. “The Spanish VALORANT community is known for its passion and energy, and we can&#39;t wait to see that atmosphere elevate one of the biggest moments of the VALORANT EMEA calendar year.”</p>
