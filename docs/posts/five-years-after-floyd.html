    <h1>Five Years After Floyd</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Five years ago this Sunday, Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd. His murder set off protests and riots across the country. Demonstrators called for sweeping changes to policing and remedies for what they described as systemic racism in law enforcement.</p><p>How much has changed? Nationwide, surprisingly little. States and cities enacted new policies aimed at improving policing, but the data suggests that these changes have had little impact on accountability or the number of killings by police officers.</p><h2 id="link-63af2f26">The changes</h2><p>After Floyd’s murder, states and police departments banned chokeholds and no-knock warrants. They mandated body cameras. They rewrote guidelines about how to de-escalate a confrontation with a suspect. They educated officers about racial profiling. And more. The changes weren’t universal, and some places did more than others. But every state passed at least some changes.</p><p>In a few cities, the federal government intervened. It investigated and publicized police abuses, pressuring local governments into court-enforced consent decrees. These pacts forced police departments to make specific changes and let federal officials and court monitors track how the policies worked over time. Freddie Gray died in 2015 after a “rough ride” while in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department; a consent decree mandated that the city’s police drivers follow the speed limit and provide functioning seatbelts when transporting detainees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At least, that’s how consent decrees used to function. This week, the Trump administration dropped efforts to investigate or oversee nearly two dozen police departments.</p><p>Meanwhile, killings by police officers rose from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Officers killed Black Americans at nearly three times the rate that they killed white Americans, roughly the same proportion as before.</p><p>And the number of prosecutions for police shootings has not changed since Floyd’s death, said Philip Stinson, a criminologist who tracks such cases. In 2015, prosecutors charged 18 officers with murder or manslaughter after an on-duty shooting. Last year, they charged 16 officers. In both years, less than 2 percent of fatal police shootings led to indictments.</p><h2 id="link-7f213d41">Waning interest</h2><p>So why didn’t much change? Experts cite two reasons.</p><p>First, lawmakers did not embrace all the proposed changes. Ohio, Minnesota and Missouri, for example, rejected more than 98 percent of the proposals that came before their legislatures, according to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-state-of-police-reform-measuring-progress-in-each-state/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Brookings Institution</a>. A bipartisan effort in Congress also collapsed. Second, to the extent lawmakers acted, the changes didn’t go far enough to transform the nature of American policing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Then the murder rate rose in 2020 and 2021, and public sentiment shifted. Voters wanted the police to focus on crime. Attention to reform faded.</p><p>Some experts point to deeper problems. Racial disparities in police killings are partly caused by officers’ prejudices, but higher crime rates in poorer minority communities also mean these places are more likely to get police attention, both good and bad. Addressing those levels of crime and its root causes, such as poverty, will require more than tweaking department guidelines and training.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Once tranquil communities like Lynden, Wash., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/george-floyd-anniversary-protests.html" title="">continue to struggle</a> with the racial fault lines exposed by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-4142c7a5">The Trump Administration</h2><ul><li><p>Trump joined hundreds of the highest-paying customers of his personal cryptocurrency, many of them from overseas, for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-memecoin-dinner.html" title="">private gala at his golf club in Virginia</a>.
