Mass deportation, he says, would end a supposed epidemic of crime and disorder. It would <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/24/trump-springfield-continued-attacks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">save the culture and secure the nation</a>. And his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, says that mass deportation would, somehow, lower prices and alleviate the housing crisis. “We have a lot of Americans that need homes,” Vance said during his <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/full-vp-debate-transcript-walz-vance-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debate Tuesday night</a> with Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. “We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here.”</p><p>If Trump is a classic American confidence man, then mass deportation is his miracle tonic — a magical tincture that treats all ailments and cures all maladies. And like any traveling salesman, Trump is careful not to mention the side effects of this potent treatment. But not only are there side effects; the potion doesn’t treat the disease and may kill the patient.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is obvious that mass deportation would be a humanitarian disaster — if past precedent is any indication of future results, the forced migration and detention of millions of people is very likely to kill thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of those caught in the dragnet of involuntary removal. If put into place, the plan would destroy communities and tear families apart. And given Trump’s hostility to birthright citizenship, there is every reason to think that his deportation regime would fall on American citizens as well, especially those with ties to the undocumented.</p><p>A little less obvious is the extent to which mass deportation would plunge the United States into economic darkness. According to a <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new report</a> from the nonpartisan American Immigration Council, a mass deportation plan designed to expel 13.3 million undocumented immigrants over about 10 years would crash the economy, immiserate millions of Americans and siphon nearly $1 trillion from the federal government.</p><p>During Tuesday’s debate, Vance said the Trump deportation plan would start with about one million alleged criminal offenders. To deport one million immigrants per year, the report says, “would incur an annual cost of $88 billion, with the majority of that cost going toward building detention camps.” Even assuming some measure of “self-deportation,” the federal government would have to build “hundreds to thousands of new detention facilities to arrest, detain, process and remove” all targeted immigrants, at an estimated cost of $66 billion per year.</p><p>On top of that, the government would need to spend $7 billion per year to conduct the arrests, $12.6 billion per year to carry out legal processing for arrestees and an average of $2.1 billion to remove these immigrants from the country. None of this includes the cost of personnel, which could raise the overall price tag quite a bit. “Even carrying out one million at-large arrests per year,” the report says, “would require ICE to hire over 30,000 new law enforcement agents and staff, instantly making it the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government.” Assuming an average annual inflation rate of 2.5 percent, this deportation program would cost at least $967.9 billion over 10 years.</p><p>For the cost of this program, the report notes, the United States could build more than 40,000 new elementary schools, construct more than 2.9 million new homes, pay full tuition and expenses for more than 8.9 million Americans to attend an in-state public college for four years, fund the Head Start program for most of the next century and buy a brand-new car for about 20.4 million people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But the cost of mass deportation almost pales in comparison to the direct economic cost of removing millions of people from the economy. Mass deportation, the report contends, would hurt key industries that rely on undocumented labor: “The construction and agriculture industries would lose at least one in eight workers, while in hospitality, about one in 14 workers would be deported due to their undocumented status.”</p><p>Additionally, mass deportation would remove “more than 30 percent of the workers in major construction trades,” nearly “28 percent of graders and sorters of agriculture products” and “a fourth of all housekeeping cleaners.” Without workers, you can’t produce the goods and services the country needs to thrive. The result would be inflation and higher prices. (And that’s on top of the similar effects Trump’s blanket tariffs on goods entering the United States are very likely to produce.)</p><p>The country would lose roughly one million undocumented business owners, along with the revenue they produce and the jobs they create. The federal government would lose tens of billions of dollars in federal taxes, including contributions to Social Security and Medicare. States and localities would lose more than $29 billion in tax revenue. Overall, the American Immigration Council concludes, “mass deportation would lead to a loss of 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent of annual U.S. G.D.P., or $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion in 2022 dollars.” For comparison’s sake, the country’s G.D.P. shrank by 4.3 percent during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. During that time, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2012/recession/pdf/recession_bls_spotlight.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unemployment peaked at 10 percent</a>. And high unemployment is associated with a broad range of social ills, including higher rates of poverty, food insecurity, addiction and premature death.</p><p>At the low estimate, then, a mass deportation program would produce — for all Americans — a social and economic crisis comparable to the Great Recession. At the high estimate, it would produce an economic and social crisis that dwarfs anything experienced by Americans since the Great Depression.</p><p>Vance tells us that mass deportation would lower demand. It would, in the sense that it would crash the economy. Maybe the cost of housing would go down, but foreclosures and evictions would go up. And if you wanted to buy the home of someone caught by the president’s deportation force, there’s no guarantee you could afford it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This observation, crass as it might sound, gets to a larger point. I’ve been discussing mass deportation as if it’s actual policy — as if it’s just one option among many for tackling the nation’s many challenges. But that’s absurd. Whether or not it works to fix the problems at hand, and it doesn’t, the mass deportation of 20 million to 25 million people — which is to say the forced detention and relocation of about 6 percent to 8 percent of the current U.S. population — is a human rights abuse. It would make the United States a pariah state. And it would violate the fundamental principles of the American creed, the core belief that “all men are created equal,” that they are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”</p><p>American cynicism, political or otherwise, is so ingrained that it’s only too easy to believe that neither Trump nor Vance is serious. Mass deportation might sound cruel and inhumane, but in this view it’s just a performance. If they win, this argument goes, they’ll set it aside in favor of something less dangerous and inflammatory.</p><p>This is wishful thinking. The mass deportation of tens of millions of Americans has been the centerpiece of Trump’s campaign for most of the past year. His running mate believes in it. His advisers, like Stephen Miller, have every intention of seeing as much of it through as possible.</p><p>The former president is running on a promise to commit a moral crime of world-historical proportions. Knowing what we know about his first term in office, what makes anyone think that he won’t try to do it?</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jamelle Bouie became a New York Times Opinion columnist in 2019.
