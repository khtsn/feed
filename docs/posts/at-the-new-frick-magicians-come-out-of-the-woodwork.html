    <h1>At the New Frick, Magicians Come Out of the Woodwork</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Welcome to the latest installment of “This Old House,” the Henry Clay Frick mansion edition. The sumptuous 1914 Beaux-Arts residence is reopening to the public on April 17 after a $220 million, four-year renovation, and with a series of member events this week. For the first time in 90 years, visitors will be able to ascend the Grand Staircase to experience the family’s private rooms on the second floor, the velvet ropes whisked away.</p><p>The makeover will allow museumgoers to reunite with the Rembrandts, Van Dykes, Vermeers, Turners, 16th to 18th century furnishings and dine at the Frick’s first-ever cafe, opening later this spring.</p><p>But less evident is the A-team of craftspeople forging new traditions at the Frick: textile weavers, lighting restorers, tassel makers, woodworkers, glass artisans and painters, from Lyon, France, to Gowanus, Brooklyn, whose skills have brought fresh energy and sparkle to an aging mansion.</p><p>The Frick’s interiors, including the Garden Court and the Oval Room, were largely the work of the architect John Russell Pope, who was tasked with transforming the house into a museum in the 1930s. The reimagining this time around was similarly daunting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Mr. Frick had the best materials and craftsmanship, so we had to come up to that level of quality,” said Ian Wardropper, the Frick Collection’s longtime director, who recently retired. And it was impossible to restore just one gallery. “It’s like if you redo the living room and suddenly your bedroom looks shabby,” Wardropper said. “My job is to preserve what everyone loved about the Frick, but with new luster and polish.”</p><p>Fine craftsmanship informs the expansive new addition by<span>  </span>Selldorf Architects with Beyer Blinder Belle, who took their cues from the historic house. “The sheer intelligence of craft at the Frick is inspiring,” said Annabelle Selldorf, the firm’s principal. “We were committed to using the same materials and details in a slightly different way, to express the character of our time.”</p><p>Here are some of the stellar artisans whose talents are on view.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The West Gallery of the Frick, with new hand-loomed green velvet wall coverings.

(They had worked on Buckingham Palace.) “We knew when the room was installed, and the threads that were used: three shades of silk, a light green, an emerald with tints of blue and one a bit more pale,” Verzier said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Velvet’s plush luxe occurs when 10,000 very fine silk threads are laid out on a clackety-clacking 19th century wooden loom and then cut as a long pile, an act that requires what Verzier calls “artisanal know-how.” The striated velvet walls appear multidimensional, the alchemy of silken threads making the hues appear to shift with the light.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man with a blue shirt and red pants holding a brush and standing on a ladder." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 820w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm/03cul-frick-artisans-20-blkm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1639w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c3cd5bdd-a0b6-5960-97e5-63fb9b6d5f6d" decoding="async" width="600" height="750"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Darren Waterston painting the mural for the new restaurant opening later this spring.

The main frieze, “Arcadia,” is a fever-dream that unfolds across the walls like a Japanese screen.

Mostly stitched by hand, with assistance from a yarn-spinning machine, these are mini-artworks of astonishing variety, culminating in exuberant, dance-worthy skirted fringes.</p><p>The silk tie-backs in the Boucher Room, the former boudoir of Adelaide Childs Frick on the second floor, are a riot of rosettes, braided cords and other elements. “You have to have patience, precision and a love for the material,” Anquetin said. The tassels in the Breakfast Room embrace a hundred tiny pompons, coils, skirts, and sateen balls, all handwoven. “If we closed the company, all these skills would disappear,” Anquetin said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dawn Ladd, a lighting restorer, saw that the chandeliers were cleaned above the grand staircase leading to the second floor of the Frick Collection. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p><strong><a href="https://www.auroralampworks.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AURORA LAMPWORKS</a></strong></p><p>Dawn Ladd has spent the past four years restoring 179 lighting fixtures for the Frick — 19 chandeliers, 37 armless hanging fixtures, 115 ceiling lights and eight sconces. Her mission was to clean them, bring them up to code and discreetly outfit most chandeliers with miniature LED spotlights called Pixis that train on paintings and sculptures.</p><p>They arrived at Aurora Lampworks’ Brooklyn studio in shrink-wrapped batches, the chandeliers hung on garment racks. (Never <em>ever</em> put an antique chandelier with sinuous arms decorated with lions or bearded Russian faces on the ground.) New candle covers were painted to look aged. The chandeliers were originally made for incandescent bulbs, which burn hotter and use more electricity. “There was a lot of grime on the surfaces from a hundred years on Fifth Avenue with four city bus lines,” said Joe Godla, the Frick’s chief conservator.</p><p>Ladd sometimes wishes she sold rugs instead, which don’t have electricity running through and don’t hang over peoples’ heads, possibly crashing on the floor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cantilevered marble reception hall stairs at the Frick Collection. “This is the most challenging staircase I’ve ever done in my life,” said William F.

Torres, president of Wilkstone, a 100-year-old marble company based in Paterson, N.J.</p><p>Eat your heart out, Hollywood.</p><p>The cinematic stairway is crafted from approximately 18 tons of Breccia Aurora Blue, a veined marble with blue streaks found in selected quarries near Brescia in northern Italy.

His grandfather Archimede (1909-1999) led a revival of ancient approaches to Venetian glassmaking; his works, along with those of his father Giampaolo and other Segusos are found at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>The Selldorf lanterns use two different glassmaking techniques. The panes are made first by pouring hot glass onto a warm table to achieve a reaction called “martellato” — a hammered texture. The jewel-like ornaments along the stems and base were handblown and have a mirrored effect created with paint. “You look at the glass ornaments and think they might be metal and then you look at the metal and it could be glass,” Seguso said. The end result is refined and simple — but “simple doesn’t mean easy,.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A chandelier above the grand staircase was cleaned of Fifth Avenue bus grime.

In the entry hall, Ford-Hart and Hart cleaned and waxed the magnificent walnut gilt coffered ceiling framed by laurel leaves and berries. On the second floor they hid wiring behind the cornices of a fanciful Chinoiserie ceiling mural with cavorting monkeys painted by Alden Twachtman (and believed to have been commissioned by the legendary decorator Elsie de Wolfe).

Visitors today will never see the effort it took to reinstall this 3-D jigsaw of a room, which had been moved to the ground floor for public viewing when the mansion opened as a museum.

The supporting team built back the cabinet for porcelains. “The paintings fit into the room within an inch of their life,” Godla, the conservator, said with relief.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
