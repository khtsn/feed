Kathy Hochul and her husband</a> at their home on a cul-de-sac on Long Island’s North Shore, officials said.</p><p>Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are expected to ask a judge to unseal an indictment against the aide, Linda Sun, 40, and her husband, Chris Hu, 41, later in the day, people with knowledge of the matter said.</p><p>Because the charges against them remain sealed, they were not immediately disclosed. But a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York confirmed Tuesday they had been arrested and said they would appear before a federal judge in Brooklyn later in the day.</p><p>Neither Ms. Sun nor Mr. Hu could be reached on Tuesday and it was not clear if they had retained lawyers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Six weeks ago, F.B.I. agents descended on the cul-de-sac in Manhasset and searched the couple’s $3.5 million five-bedroom house in an early-morning raid, but the basis for that action and the crimes they were investigating were unclear at that time. Neither could be reached for comment after the raid and they did not respond to voice mail and text messages.</p><p>Ms. Sun has worked in state government for nearly 14 years, holding a variety of positions, according to her LinkedIn profile. </p><p>She began in the legislative branch, working as chief of staff to an assemblywoman, Grace Meng, who is now a congresswoman. Ms. Sun then worked in various positions in the administrations of both Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Ms. Hochul, according to the LinkedIn profile.</p><p>She served in roles focused on business development; Asian American affairs; and diversity, equity and inclusion. She left Ms. Hochul’s executive chamber after roughly 15 months, moving on to a position at the New York Department of Labor in November 2022. Five months later, she left to serve as campaign manager for Austin Cheng, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for a congressional seat on Long Island.</p><p>At the time of the raid in July, Avi Small, the press secretary for Ms. Hochul, declined to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Her husband, Mr. Hu, operates a liquor store in Flushing, Queens, Leivine Wine &amp; Spirits. Over the last decade, he also has incorporated several other businesses, including a company he created in 2020 during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic called Medical Supplies USA LLC. He also created two other businesses, Golden Capital Group LLC in 2016 and LCA Holdings LLC in 2023, the nature of which could not be immediately determined.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>William K.
