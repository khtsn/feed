At the time of the shooting there were about 150 people working inside the large building. </p><p>The shooting was most likely a targeted attack, Mr. Jones said, but he added that the police had not established a motive. </p><p>“He had been at work for some time when this occurred,” Mr. Jones said, and there had been no reports that there was any issue or conflict during his shift. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The chief also said that the police had recovered one weapon at the crime scene, a handgun. They believed that no other weapons were used, and that the suspect did not have anyone else helping him. Officials did not provide any information about the victims, or about the condition of the five people who were hospitalized. </p><p>Police were first alerted to the shooting at about 10:30 p.m. local time, New Albany officials said in a <a href="https://newalbanyohio.org/alert/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> early Wednesday. </p><p>People were fleeing the building when the police arrived Tuesday night, but the suspect had already left the area by the time officers got to the scene, Mr. Jones said.</p><p>The shooting took place at a warehouse for a beauty brand called KDC/One, city officials said. KDC/One is a beauty and personal care company headquartered near Montreal. The company did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment.</p><p>The authorities said that they did not believe that the suspect posed any danger to the community.</p><p>“We have multiple agencies working right now to apprehend the suspect,” Sloan Spalding, New Albany’s mayor, said Wednesday morning. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
