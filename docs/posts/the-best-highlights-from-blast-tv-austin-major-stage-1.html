And, moreover, whether administration officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/trump-abrego-garcia-deported-hearing.html" title="">should be held in contempt</a> for repeatedly stonewalling a judge’s effort to get to the bottom of their actions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Well before Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family filed a lawsuit seeking to force the White House to release him from El Salvador, administration officials had tried all means at their disposal to keep him overseas as they figured out a solution to the problem they had created, The New York Times found in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-abrego-garcia-el-salvador-deportation.html" title="">a recent investigation</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cesar Ábrego García, left, and Cecilia García, center, the brother and mother of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, participated in a press conference with Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, following his trip to El Salvador.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Allison Bailey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the days before the administration’s error was made public, officials at the Department of Homeland Security discussed portraying Mr. Abrego Garcia as a “leader” of MS-13, even though they could find no evidence to support the claim. They considered ways to nullify the original order that had barred his deportation to El Salvador. And they sought to downplay the danger he might face in one of that country’s most notorious prisons.</p><p>To Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, it was no surprise that the same officials who had fought so hard against securing his return suddenly agreed to bring him back to U.S. soil after they had obtained an indictment that bolstered the story they had been telling from the start.</p><p>“Today’s action proves what we’ve known all along — that the administration had the ability to bring him back and just refused to do so,” said Andrew Rossman, one of the lawyers. “It’s now up to our judicial system to see that Mr. Abrego Garcia receives the due process that the Constitution guarantees.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Questions have already been raised about the criminal case, filed in Federal District Court in Nashville. There was concern and disagreement in recent weeks among prosecutors about how to proceed with the charges, two people familiar with the matter said, leading to the resignation of a supervisor in the federal prosecutor’s office handling the case.</p><p>Regardless of how the case turns out, the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia suggests that the administration was, at least in some ways, feeling the heat of the three court orders it was facing to facilitate his freedom. The decision could be read, in fact, as the Justice Department simultaneously caving to the orders while also flexing its muscles.</p><p>By indicting Mr. Abrego Garcia, the department, after all, gave itself the perfect excuse to bring him back to the United States — one that served to avoid a potentially painful confrontation with the Supreme Court and to burnish the administration’s law-and-order image.</p><p>And as Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, pointed out on Friday, the charges could render moot the lawsuit filed by Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family. If that happens, it might get the White House off the hook entirely for the way in which it skirted due process in deporting Mr. Abrego Garcia.</p><p>Last month, the Justice Department took a somewhat similar approach in the case of Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist employed by Harvard who was detained three months ago after failing to declare scientific samples she was carrying in her luggage. When it appeared as if Ms. Petrova might walk free in her immigration case, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/health/detained-russian-scientist-harvard.html" title="">prosecutors filed a criminal charge against her</a> for behavior that would ordinarily be treated as a minor infraction, punishable with a fine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Petrova’s attorney, Gregory Romanovsky, said at the time that the criminal charge, “filed three months after the alleged customs violation, is clearly intended to make Kseniia look like a criminal to justify their efforts to deport her.”</p><p>The Trump administration is facing several other court orders to “facilitate” the return of immigrants who were recently expelled under wrongful or questionable circumstances.</p><p>On Wednesday, in a rare example of compliance with a court order, the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/guatemalan-deported-mexico-trump.html" title="">brought back to the United States a Guatemalan man</a> who was deported to Mexico this year in violation of an order forbidding immigrants from being sent to countries not their own without first being given a “meaningful opportunity” to challenge their removal.</p><p>It remains unclear what effect the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia will have on a different group of immigrants: the nearly 140 Venezuelan men who were sent to El Salvador on the same set of flights that he was on — albeit under the powers of a different legal tool, a rarely-invoked 18th-century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>Just a few days ago, a federal judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-deportations-venezuela-alien-enemies-act.html" title="">ordered the administration to take steps toward giving the Venezuelan men the due process</a> that they had been denied. But even though they were being held in El Salvador under similar terms as Mr. Abrego Garcia, there was no guarantee that Trump officials would bring them back, said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who has been representing them.</p><p>“Clearly, the administration has the technical ability to return people from El Salvador,” Mr. Gelernt said, pointing to the example of Mr. Abrego Garcia. “At a minimum, that reinforces what we have always believed — that the government can bring back anyone it wants, if it actually wants to.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
