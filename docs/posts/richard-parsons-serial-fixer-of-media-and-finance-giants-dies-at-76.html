Parsons, whose humane approach to business made him a serial troubleshooter at distressed companies such as Time Warner, CBS and Citigroup and a sought-after adviser at the highest echelons of American industry, died on Thursday at his Manhattan home. He was 76.</p><p>The cause was bone cancer, said Ronald S. Lauder, a member of the Estée Lauder board and one of Mr. Parsons’s oldest friends.</p><p>Mr. Parsons’s winding career tracked the biggest companies in American media and finance — and the biggest problems. Time and again, he stepped in when things looked catastrophic and put his smooth leadership style to work, disentangling Gordian knots and assuaging discontented shareholders.</p><p>Mr. Parsons, a jazz-loving oenophile who served on the board of the Apollo Theater and owned a Tuscan winery, rose to the top of the business world in an era when he was frequently the only Black executive in the boardroom. A self-described “Rockefeller Republican,” Mr. Parsons spoke out on social justice issues in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/06/business/dick-parsons-georgia-voting-law/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> protesting a 2021 law that imposed restrictions on Georgia voters and co-founded <a href="https://equityalliance.fund/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Equity Alliance</a>, a fund that backs early-stage ventures led by women and people of color.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Parsons’s lengthy résumé is a catalog of corporate emergencies: He stanched losses at Dime Bancorp during the savings-and-loan crisis in the 1980s; cleaned up the disastrous merger of AOL and Time Warner after the dot-com bust at the turn of the century; stepped in at Citigroup as the banking colossus teetered after the 2007-8 financial crisis; served as CBS’s board chairman after its disgraced chief executive, Leslie Moonves, went to war with its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone; and came out of semiretirement to steady the Los Angeles Clippers after their owner at the time, Donald Sterling, made racist remarks.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Parsons was named interim chief executive of the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kevork Djansezian/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Throughout it all, Mr. Parsons deployed his easy manner and extensive Rolodex — he was an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller, the former New York governor and vice president — to lead, charm and cajole his way out of tight corporate corners. In 2007, as Time Warner was crawling back from the brink of disaster, Mr. Parsons summed up his career during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/25/business/media/25nocera.html" title="">a steakhouse interview</a> with The New York Times before ordering a second bottle of wine.</p><p>“I want my legacy to be simple: I left the place in good shape and in good hands,” he said.</p><p>Survivors include Mr. Parsons’s wife, Laura, with whom he raised three children.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
