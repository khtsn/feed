The effort was, in effect, an offer of access to the White House in exchange for an investment in one of Mr. Trump’s crypto ventures.</p><p>“Have Dinner with President Trump and the $TRUMP Community!” the invitation said. “Let the President know how many $TRUMP coins YOU own!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For months, Mr. Trump’s forays into crypto have created ethical conflicts with little precedent in presidential history. As he markets digital currencies to the public, Mr. Trump has also appointed regulators who are scaling back crypto enforcement and called for legislation that would boost the industry’s prospects in the United States.</p><p>As news of the dinner invitation spread on social media, the memecoin’s price surged more than 60 percent, suggesting that investors were rushing to accumulate enough coins to qualify for a dinner seat.</p><p>“This is really incredible,” said Corey Frayer, who oversaw crypto policy for the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. “They are making the pay-to-play deal explicit.”</p><p>A business entity linked to Mr. Trump owns a large tranche of the coins, meaning the president personally profits every time the price increases, at least on paper. Mr. Trump and his business partners also collect fees when the coins are traded, a windfall that amounted to nearly $100 million in the weeks after the coin debuted in January.</p><p>Victoria Haneman, a law professor at Creighton University, said the offering raised concerns about the ways Mr. Trump and his businesses “may maneuver to profit off the presidency.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Early this year, the S.E.C. issued official guidance saying memecoins, a type of cryptocurrency based on an online joke or celebrity mascot, will not be subject to oversight by the agency. Crypto skeptics criticized the policy as a risky move that could open the door to rampant fraud by memecoin promoters.</p><p>As president, Mr. Trump has broad immunity from laws governing conflicts of interest, a loophole he has <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-the-president-cant-have-a-conflict-of-interest-231760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pointed out</a> in the past. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump’s son Eric, who helps run the Trump Organization, a sponsor of the $TRUMP coin, declined to comment.</p><p>Once a cryptocurrency skeptic, Mr. Trump embraced digital currencies on the campaign trail last year, as crypto companies poured tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 election.</p><p>In the fall, Mr. Trump and his sons, Donald Jr., Eric and Barron, said they were starting a company, World Liberty Financial, that offered a digital currency called WLFI. So far, $550 million of those coins have been sold, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250317855322/en/Trump-Inspired-World-Liberty-Financial-Closes-%24550-Million-Across-Token-Sales" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the company</a>.</p><p>Not long after, Mr. Trump’s social media firm, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-media-crypto.html" title="">offer crypto-related financial products</a> to amateur investors and announced a partnership with Crypto.com, a digital trading platform.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Mr. Trump’s memecoin venture has generated the most attention.</p><p>Just three days before the inauguration, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media site, that he was selling the coin. Sales of $TRUMP immediately spiked, making the president-elect a crypto billionaire on paper.</p><p>Memecoins tend to rise and fall quickly, and $TRUMP’s price soon cratered. Traders who had accumulated the coin suffered more than $2 billion in cumulative losses.</p><p>The dinner announcement appeared calculated to ignite more interest in the coins.</p><p>When $TRUMP went on sale in January, a large stash of the coins were allocated to the project’s backers. But rules built into the offering prevented those insiders from selling any of the coins <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/trump-memecoin-unlock-raises-risk-of-further-slide-by-once-hot-token?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=zVYYYI5e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">until last week</a>, raising fears that they would try to offload their holdings and cause $TRUMP’s price to drop further.</p><p>Instead, the price gradually climbed in the days before the invitation was released and then surged as the announcement went live.</p><p>On the memecoin’s website, the $TRUMP promoters set up a leaderboard of the coin’s biggest investors — essentially an online game allowing buyers to track their place in the rankings. Dinner invitations would go to the “top 220 average $TRUMP owners” between April 23 and May 12, the website said. The top 25 buyers would win access to a reception with Mr. Trump before the dinner and a V.I.P. tour of the White House. (At the moment, the 25th-ranked investor on the chart owns about 4,000 coins, worth roughly $54,000.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The more $TRUMP you hold — and the longer you hold it — the higher Your Ranking will be,” <a href="https://gettrumpmemes.com/dinner" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the website said.</a></p><p>The dinner with Mr. Trump is scheduled to take place on May 22 at the Trump National Golf Club, the website said, calling it the “Most Exclusive Once in Lifetime Invitation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Yaffe-Bellany writes about the crypto industry from San Francisco.
