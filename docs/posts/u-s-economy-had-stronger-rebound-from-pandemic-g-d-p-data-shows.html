<p>Quarterly change in gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation</p>
</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Perhaps most notably, the government now says G.D.P. grew slightly in the second quarter of 2022, rather than contracting as previously believed. As a result, government statistics no longer show the U.S. economy as experiencing two consecutive quarters of declining G.D.P. in early 2022 — a common definition of a recession, though not the one used in the United States. (The revised data still shows that G.D.P. declined in the first quarter of 2022, but more modestly than previously reported.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The official arbiter of recession in the United States is the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research organization made up of academic economists. The group <a href="https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defines a recession</a> as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” and it bases its decisions on a variety of indicators including employment, income and spending.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/business/economy/recession-economy.html" title="">Few economists in 2022</a> believed that the U.S. economy met the requirements for a recession. But many feared it was headed for one because of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive efforts to bring down inflation with high interest rates. Instead, growth quickly resumed and has remained surprisingly resilient.</p><p>More recently, however, slowing job growth and rising unemployment have led some forecasters, including at the Fed, to worry that resilience might be fading. The revisions on Thursday showed that growth was somewhat weaker in late 2023 than had initially been reported, but was slightly stronger early this year.</p><p>The government’s estimate of the growth rate of G.D.P. in the second quarter of 2024 was unchanged at 3 percent. Consumer spending grew slightly more slowly than previously reported, but business investment was revised upward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The reliability of U.S. economic data has been under increasing scrutiny recently, particularly after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/us-jobs-economy.html" title="">an unusually large downward revision last month</a> to estimates of job growth in 2023 and early 2024.</p><p>The G.D.P. updates, however, were not large by historical standards, and were in the opposite direction from the jobs revisions. And the new figures more closely align with other data from the period that suggested the economy was on firm footing.</p><p>The new data also help resolve what had been a bit of an economic mystery. Gross domestic income — an alternative measure of growth based on income rather than spending — had appeared to be significantly weaker than gross domestic product in recent quarters. That was perplexing because the two measures should, in theory, be identical.</p><p>The revisions on Thursday narrowed the gap, though they didn’t eliminate it. The government now says gross domestic income increased 2.9 percent from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023, compared with 3.2 percent growth in G.D.P. during the same period. (Both figures are adjusted for inflation.)</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Casselman writes about economics with a particular focus on stories involving data.
