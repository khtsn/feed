The base was renamed Fort Liberty as part of the U.S. military’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/politics/army-bases-confederate-names.html" title="">examination of its history</a> with race. But Mr. Trump and other conservatives raged against the changes, arguing that “wokeness” was softening the military and wiping away important elements of American tradition and heritage.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/trump-town-hall-promises-veterans.html" title="">campaigned on a promise to restore the old name</a>, and his pledge was brought to fruition on Friday, but with a twist that seemed both a rewriting of history and an internet troll: Fort Liberty again became Fort Bragg, not in honor of the Confederate general but in memory of Pvt. Roland L. Bragg, a previously obscure infantryman who had served at Fort Bragg and fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The official ceremony at the military base on Friday cemented a political victory for Mr. Trump, who suffered a legislative defeat in 2020 when Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/us/politics/house-overrides-trump-veto-military-bill.html" title="">pushed past his veto</a> of a bill with a provision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/politics/congress-trump-confederate-base-names.html" title="">rename nine Army bases</a> that had honored treasonous Confederate generals who fought against the United States to preserve slavery and white supremacy.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers preparing for the ceremony on Friday.

They included decorated officers, enlisted troops who survived harrowing trials in battle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/04/us/politics/army-bases-confederate-names.html#:~:text=Image-,Fort%20Eisenhower,-(Fort%20Gordon%2C%20Ga" title="">President Dwight D.

They hosted members of Private Bragg’s extended family at the event, and spoke of his valor and courage while fighting the Nazis in Europe. They described one episode in which the soldier escaped capture and regrouped with his comrades by knocking out an enemy soldier and driving a German ambulance through enemy lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Fort Bragg is named after Roland L. Bragg,” Lt. Gen. Gregory Anderson, the mission commander at Fort Bragg, replied when asked about the base name’s ties to the Confederacy.</p><p>“He’s one of us,” he added of Private Bragg. “He’s cut from the same, you know, cloth we are. That’s what I think about.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Diane Watts, Private Bragg’s daughter, at the ceremony. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Diane Watts, Private Bragg’s daughter, said she was unaware of Mr. Hegseth’s order to change the name of the base to honor her father <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/02/11/politics/state-politics/roland-bragg-fort-bragg-namesake-family-shocked/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">until a local reporter in Maine</a> called her to ask about it. She had assumed it was a prank call.</p><p>When a reporter asked whether she thought her father’s name might be being used for political purposes, Ms. Watts replied: “I don’t think that’s the case. I really don’t. I think that they looked for a man of good character, and they found my dad.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Daniel Driscoll, the Army secretary, attended the renaming ceremony but declined to answer questions.</p><p>The cost of renaming the Army bases named for Confederates was <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/03/24/the-cost-to-rename-9-confederacy-honoring-army-bases-has-doubled/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated at about $39 million</a>, covering expenses like replacing the signage and removing old references to the bases’ outdated names.</p><p>Colonel K. Mixon, the garrison commander for Fort Bragg, estimated that the costs to reverse the changes there would be less than $1 million. Businesses and street signs near Fort Bragg in nearby Fayetteville, N.C., still referred to Fort Liberty on Friday. The nearby Army Airborne &amp; Special Operations Museum on Friday featured merchandise with the name of Fort Liberty as well as shirts with the words “Bragg is back!”</p><p>The original naming of the nine Army bases was part of a movement to glorify the Confederacy and advance the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lost-Cause" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lost Cause myth</a> that the Civil War was fought over “states’ rights” and not slavery.</p><p>These Confederate generals were <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1865/05/27/87241642.html?pageNumber=1" title="">at first pariahs</a> after the Civil War. But by the height of the Jim Crow era, they were idolized by many Americans, especially in the South.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A gun salute at the ceremony.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2020, amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html" title="">racial justice</a> protests in many American cities after the murder of George Floyd, an overwhelming majority of Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/us/politics/house-overrides-trump-veto-military-bill.html" title="">pushed past Mr. Trump’s veto</a> of a military policy bill to strip the names of Army bases named for Confederates, starting the process to give the installations new names.</p><p>In 2023, Fort Bragg was officially renamed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/04/us/politics/army-bases-confederate-names.html" title="">along with eight other Army bases originally named for Confederates</a>.</p><p>But Mr. Trump, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/arts/design/trump-robert-e-lee-george-washington-thomas-jefferson.html" title="">repeatedly defended monuments honoring Confederates</a>, had vowed during the 2024 campaign to revert the name of Fort Bragg to honor Braxton Bragg, the Confederate general, who was widely considered by his fellow Confederates and many historians to have been a poor commander.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance had also falsely claimed while campaigning near the base last year that Vice President Kamala Harris had directed the changing of the name of the base during the Biden administration, rather than a bipartisan, veto-proof majority of Congress in the final days of Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>“It’s Fort Bragg, and we’re proud,” Mr. Vance said in Raeford, N.C., in October.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Hegseth said that Fort Moore — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/04/us/politics/army-bases-confederate-names.html#:~:text=Associated%20Press-,Fort%20Moore,-(Fort%20Benning%2C%20Ga" title="">renamed in 2023 for Lt.
