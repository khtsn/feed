The federal indictment also names Ms. Thao’s boyfriend, Andre Jones; the head of a local waste company, David Trung Duong; and Mr. Duong’s son, Andy Hung Duong.</p><p>Patrick D. Robbins, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, said on Friday that Ms. Thao in 2022 had agreed to extend a city contract with the waste company, California Waste Solutions, buy housing from the firm and use her influence to help the Duongs in exchange for a campaign mailer effort and $95,000 in side payments for Mr. Jones.</p><p>The indictment came after Ms. Thao, a Democrat who was elected as Oakland’s top official in 2022, became the first mayor of a large American city to be recalled in more than a decade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Efforts to remove Ms. Thao from office had begun long before she was publicly linked in June to a federal investigation. Early in her tenure, residents of Oakland, often regarded as a gritty and soulful alternative to San Francisco, had become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/elections/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-recall.html" title="">increasingly frustrated</a> with the city’s high crime rates, a widening budget deficit and the loss of major league sports teams. Ms. Thao’s decision to fire a popular police chief also rankled her critics.</p><p>Confidence in Ms. Thao further plummeted last summer after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/us/politics/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-fbi-raid.html" title="">F.B.I. agents raided her home</a> in the Oakland Hills for hours.</p><p>As part of the June raid, F.B.I. agents searched three other properties in Oakland that were associated with the Duong family. David Duong and his family have been <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2020/09/15/accusations-of-political-money-laundering-under-investigation-in-oakland/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigated</a> by Oakland’s Public Ethics Commission for allegations of bypassing campaign limits and giving money to political candidates through “straw donors,” including to Ms. Thao during her campaign for a City Council seat.</p><p>Mr. Duong did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Heather Knight is a reporter in San Francisco, leading The Times’s coverage of the Bay Area and Northern California.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/heather-knight">More about Heather Knight</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Party of Their Own: </strong>Latino boys looking to celebrate their entry into adulthood are holding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/quinceanera-boys-quinceanero.html">lavish and elaborate quinceañeros</a> — a new take on a centuries-old tradition reserved only for girls</p></li><li><p><strong>Drafting an ‘Old Ball Coach’: </strong>Sid Edwards was a high school football coach who had never run for office.
