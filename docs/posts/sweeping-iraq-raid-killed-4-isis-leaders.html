Two senior commanders for ISIS operations in western Iraq were also killed, the military’s statement said.</p><p>Another main target killed was Abu Ali al-Tunisi, a Tunisian national who was the subject of a <a href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/abu-ali-al-tunisi/#:~:text=Al%2DTunisi%20is%20a%20key,States%20and%20its%20interests%20abroad." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$5 million reward</a> from the U.S. government, the military revealed on Friday. Mr. al-Tunisi has been ISIS’s most significant designer, manufacturer and teacher in explosives — including improvised devices, suicide vests and car bombs, counterterrorism officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The raid appears to have effectively killed off ISIS’s entire command in Anbar,” Charles Lister, the director of the Middle East Institute’s Syria and counterterrorism programs, wrote in a Substack newsletter, <a href="https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/us-iraqi-raid-took-out-6-senior-isis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Syria Weekly,”</a> on Friday. Anbar is a vast province in western Iraq that has been a locus for violent Sunni extremists for years.</p><p>Central Command and the Iraqi military offered scant details when they announced the raid on Aug. 30, even though it was one of the most sweeping counterterrorism missions in the country in years.</p><p>Seven U.S. soldiers were injured as more than 200 troops from both countries — including elite Army Rangers backing up the main assault force — hunted down fighters in bunkers over miles of remote terrain, U.S. and Iraqi officials said, adding that the size, scope and focus of the mission underscored the terrorist organization’s resurgence in recent months.</p><p>The joint operation in Anbar province came even as Iraq’s prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, and Iraqi military commanders say they can keep ISIS under control without U.S.-led assistance. Iraq and the United States are negotiating an agreement that would wind down the U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq over the next two years. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and 900 in neighboring Syria.</p><p>Central Command, however, announced in July that the number of attacks claimed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria was on track to double this year from last year. ISIS asserted responsibility for 153 attacks in the two countries in the first six months of 2024, the command said, but the military has repeatedly refused to provide a country-by-country breakdown of the figures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“With ISIS resurgent next door in Syria and U.S. troops now scheduled to depart Iraq by the end of 2026, degrading ISIS’s leadership and capabilities in Iraq is more vital than ever,” Mr. Lister wrote.</p><p>The United States and other allied forces have helped Iraqi forces carry out more than 250 counterterrorism missions since October, according to Pentagon officials.</p><p>But this operation was unusual in the heavy presence of American commandos leading the initial raid. More than 100 U.S. Special Operations forces and other troops joined a smaller number of Iraqi soldiers in the main helicopter-borne, predawn assault.</p><p>Central Command in its statement said the raids “served to disrupt and degrade ISIS’s ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against Iraqi civilians, as well as U.S. citizens, allies and partners throughout the region and beyond.”</p><p>Besides killing the ISIS insurgents, the American and Iraqi commandos scooped up a trove of cellphones, computers and other sources of information from the raids, military officials said on Friday. U.S. analysts will first quickly assess the information to determine if it holds clues that commandos could use to carry out immediate attacks against other high-priority targets.</p><p>Counterterrorism analysts will then spend months poring over the data to learn more about the group’s leaders, finances, operations and planning.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/islamic-state">Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/defense-budget">Defense Budget</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>White House Denounces Report:</strong> The administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/us/politics/afghanistan-report.html&#39;">dismissed a new House Republican investigative report</a> castigating President Biden’s administration for the chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying that it ignores critical facts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blocking U.S. Steel Takeover:</strong> As the Biden administration nears a decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/politics/biden-us-steel-nippon.html">block the proposed acquisition</a> of U.S. Steel, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-pennsylvania.html">debate over national and economic security</a> is being dwarfed by presidential politics.
