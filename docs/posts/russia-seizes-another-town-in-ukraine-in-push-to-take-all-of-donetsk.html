Ukraine’s military <a href="https://t.me/ombr_110/428" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acknowledged its withdrawal from most of the town</a> but said that its troops maintained a foothold on the northern outskirts.</p><p>Although this gain is modest compared with Russia’s recent seizure of nearby Ukrainian strongholds like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-donetsk-vuhledar.html" title="">Vuhledar</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/europe/kurakhove-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">Kurakhove</a>, it underscores the effectiveness of a tactic that Moscow has been employing to take one town after another in eastern Ukraine: using its overwhelming personnel advantage to attack relentlessly, gradually trapping Ukrainian forces in a pincer movement and forcing them to retreat to avoid encirclement.</p><p>“From a tactical perspective, their approach was correct — they understood their capabilities and advantages and used them effectively,” Maj. Ivan Sekach, a press officer for the Ukrainian military’s 110th Brigade, which has been defending the area, said in an interview. “It would not be accurate to claim that the Russians don’t know how to fight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Major Sekach said that Ukrainian troops had been fighting with a river at their back that greatly complicated operations, adding that for the past two weeks, ammunition and food had to be delivered by drones.</p><p>“Troop reinforcements must cross the river, which is a very complex operation,” he said, noting that Russia was “of course aware of this.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
