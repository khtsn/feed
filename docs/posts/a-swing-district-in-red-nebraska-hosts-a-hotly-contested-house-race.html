But it was another Democrat looking to make history who drew the first standing ovation of the evening.</p><p>“Tony, Tony, Tony,” the audience erupted as Tony Vargas, a state senator, stood at the lectern. </p><p>“You really know how to make someone feel very, very welcome,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Vargas, 40, is vying to become the first Latino to represent Nebraska in Congress, and he has become one of the most notable Democratic candidates on the rise as he competes in a heated House race at the center of national attention.</p><p>In 2022, when Mr. Vargas first challenged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/us/politics/republican-don-bacon-wins-in-biden-district.html" title="">Representative Don Bacon</a>, a Republican, he lost by less than three percentage points, not even 6,000 votes. Now, their rematch is taking place in the middle of a tightly contested presidential election, and Mr. Bacon’s 2nd District appears to be swinging in Vice President Kamala <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/nebraska/2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harris’s direction</a>, bringing tailwinds for Democratic candidates down the ballot like Mr. Vargas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nebraska is solidly Republican, but the 2nd District, which encompasses Omaha and is known as Nebraska’s blue dot, is a swing region that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020. Biden won with 56.4 percent of the vote.</p><p>A coveted victory there could help sway control of Congress, as well as decide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/nebraska-trump-electoral-vote.html" title="">the next president.</a> Nebraska is one of two states (along with Maine) that award an electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. That vote could be of such national consequence this year that Republican allies of former President Donald J. Trump in the Nebraska Legislature have been unsuccessfully pushing to change <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/nebraska-mike-mcdonnell-electoral-vote-trump.html" title="">how it is awarded</a>.</p><p>Omaha Democrats have been showing their support for the Harris-Walz ticket with campaign signs in their yards emblazoned with a single blue dot.</p><p>As Mr. Vargas helped open for Mr. Walz on Saturday, two surrogates for Mr. Trump’s campaign — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the onetime presidential candidate, and former Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii — were making their own appearances at a downtown Omaha hotel.</p><p>Mr. Vargas, the son of Peruvian immigrants, has been drawing on his background to connect with working-class voters. He has been running on pledges to pass a middle-class tax cut and keep prescription costs low, and has sought to cast Mr. Bacon as too closely aligned to Mr. Trump and too far to the right on issues like abortion rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Bacon, a retired general, has been leaning on his foreign policy credentials and his record. In an interview, Mr. Bacon said most people in his district would find Mr. Vargas’s attempts to characterize him as a Trump extremist as “laughable.” Mr. Bacon added that he disagreed with Mr. Trump on important issues such as the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and Mr. Trump’s treatment of Vice President Mike Pence. He had also voted to certify the 2020 presidential election and in favor of bipartisan legislation, including President Biden’s signature infrastructure bill, which Mr. Bacon said he helped shape in the House.</p><p>On Saturday, Mr. Vargas joined Mr. Walz onstage, casting Mr. Trump as a dangerous and divisive force in American politics and urging Democrats to head to the polls “to rebuild democracy.”</p><p>In an interview earlier at the amphitheater, Mr. Vargas said his team had knocked on more doors than they had at the same point in the last election, and that his campaign was drawing energy from a broader array of voters, including independents and Republicans. He said his closing pitch was a call to boot out Mr. Trump’s Republican “extremists and enablers.”</p><p>“Congress can’t get anything done,” he said. “We need a Congress that can actually focus on working-class, middle-class issues.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jazmine Ulloa is a national politics reporter for The Times, covering the 2024 presidential campaign.
