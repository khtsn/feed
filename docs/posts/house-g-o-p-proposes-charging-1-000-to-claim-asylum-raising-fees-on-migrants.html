    <h1>House G.O.P. Proposes Charging $1,000 to Claim Asylum, Raising Fees on Migrants</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>House Republicans are proposing to charge migrants $1,000 to claim asylum, one of a series of new or increased fees on immigrants seeking to gain legal entry into the United States that is part of their effort to curb immigration and pay for the Trump administration’s border crackdown.</p><p>The fees on immigrants are one of several proposals <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/judiciary_recon_ans_xml.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in legislation released on Monday by the House Judiciary Committee</a> to be included in the major domestic policy bill Republicans are putting together to implement President Trump’s domestic agenda.</p><p>The application fee would be the first time the United States specifically charged migrants who are seeking asylum, a status meant for people who have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted in their home country because of their race, religion or nationality. Typically, migrants who claim asylum are released into the United States to wait for court appearances. But a huge backlog in such claims has kept many of those seeking asylum in the country for years, waiting for their cases to be heard. Under the bill, applicants would also pay $100 a year while their application is pending,</p><p>The bill would also require a $1,000 fee for most immigrants who are paroled into the United States and a $3,500 fee for those sponsoring children — large sums that could make it more difficult for minors who cross the border alone to be released from federal custody and taken in by family members in the United States.</p></div></div>
