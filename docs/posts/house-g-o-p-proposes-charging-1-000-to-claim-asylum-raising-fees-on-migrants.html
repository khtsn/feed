Typically, migrants who claim asylum are released into the United States to wait for court appearances. But a huge backlog in such claims has kept many of those seeking asylum in the country for years, waiting for their cases to be heard. Under the bill, applicants would also pay $100 a year while their application is pending,</p><p>The bill would also require a $1,000 fee for most immigrants who are paroled into the United States and a $3,500 fee for those sponsoring children — large sums that could make it more difficult for minors who cross the border alone to be released from federal custody and taken in by family members in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Asylum seekers and people under temporary protected status — meant to protect them from being sent back to countries facing conflict or natural disasters — would have to pay a $550 fee when applying for authorization to work.</p><p>Those fees, likely to be burdensome to many immigrants, would serve as a further deterrent to those considering crossing the border illegally. Such crossings are currently at their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/world/americas/mexico-trump-migration.html" title="">lowest level in years</a>.</p><p>Though the Republicans’ budget blueprint generally calls for slashing taxes and government spending, it provides for increased funding for immigration enforcement, deportations and border security initiatives.</p><p>The plan being considered by the House Judiciary Committee calls for $45 billion to build and expand immigrant detention centers, $8 billion to hire Immigration and Customs Enforcement staff and $1.25 billion to help the Justice Department immigration judges, their staff and their courts. </p><p>Portions of many of the new or expanded fees for migrants would be directed toward supporting the new spending.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Gold covers Congress for The Times, with a focus on immigration policy and congressional oversight.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>2 Children With Citizenship Deported:</strong> A 4-year-old and a 7-year-old with U.S. citizenship along with their mother were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/27/us/trump-news#us-citizen-children-deported-honduras-trump">put on a flight to Honduras on Friday,</a> adding to the recent string of American citizens caught in the cross hairs of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</p></li><li><p><strong>More Than 100 Detained in Colorado Raid:</strong> Federal agents raided an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs early Sunday morning and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/immigrants-colorado-raid-dea.html">detained more than 100 people</a> who they said were undocumented immigrants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deported to a ‘Home’ He Barely Knew: </strong>Two decades had passed since Nascimento Blair was last in Jamaica, his homeland. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/nyregion/deportation-trump-jamaica.html">Much had changed, including Blair himself</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenging Due Process Rights:</strong> White House officials are eschewing normal legal processes as they rush to ramp up deportations, saying there is no time to afford unauthorized immigrants any rights — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-immigrants-trials-deportation.html">and that they don’t deserve them anyway</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A ‘Shattered’ Life: </strong>An Indonesian man with a student visa and an American wife thought he would soon get a green card. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/minnesota-student-aditya-harsono-visa.html">Now, he could get deported over a 2022 arrest</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</strong><strong>:</strong> Four House Democrats traveled to El Salvador to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/abrego-garcia-el-salvador-democrats.html">press for the release of a Maryland resident</a> who was mistakenly deported there.
