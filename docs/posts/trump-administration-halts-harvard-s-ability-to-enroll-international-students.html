The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p><p>The latest move is likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, according to one person familiar with the school’s thinking who insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The university sued the administration last month over the government’s attempt to impose changes to its curriculum, admissions policies and hiring practices.</p><p>“I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,” according to a letter sent to the university by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>About 6,800 international students attended Harvard this year, or roughly 27 percent of the student body, <a href="https://oneworld.worldwide.harvard.edu/international-students-at-harvard/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to university enrollment data</a>. That is up from 19.7 percent in 2010.</p><p>The move is likely to have a significant effect on the university’s bottom line.</p><p>Tuition at Harvard is $59,320 for the school year that begins later this year, and costs can rise to nearly $87,000 when room and board are included. International students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/us/losing-international-students-could-devastate-many-colleges.html" title="">tend to pay larger shares of education costs</a> compared with other students.</p><p>Spokesmen for the Department of Homeland Security and Harvard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ms. Noem posted the letter on social media later on Thursday.</p><p>In a news release confirming the administration’s action, the Department of Homeland Security sent a stark message to Harvard’s international students: “This means Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
