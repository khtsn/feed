The Homeland Security Department also oversees the Secret Service, the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (In recent days, Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news" title="">suggested disbanding</a> FEMA.)</p><p>Ms. Noem, a former congresswoman and two-term South Dakota governor, has been closely aligned with Mr. Trump on immigration, the issue he says won him the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She has described high levels of immigration to the United States in recent years as an “invasion,” and she has supported restoring a policy that requires asylum seekers to stay in Mexico for the duration of their U.S. cases. The policy, in place during Mr. Trump’s first term, was heavily criticized by Democrats and immigration-rights activists.</p><p>As governor of South Dakota, she opposed accepting Afghan refugees after the chaotic American withdrawal from Afghanistan, and she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/noem-south-dakota-flood-homeland-security.html" title="">sent members of her state’s National Guard to Texas</a> to address the immigration crisis — a contentious move that Mr. Trump cited in picking her for homeland security secretary.</p><p>While most Senate Democrats opposed Ms. Noem’s nomination, she received scattered support from Democratic lawmakers. Her confirmation went smoothly compared with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-vote#pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-trump" title="">bruising battle to confirm Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</a>, who faced allegations of sexual abuse and excessive drinking, which he denied. Mr. Hegseth was approved by a 51-to-50 vote on Friday after Vice President JD Vance stepped in to cast a tiebreaking vote.</p><p>One Democrat who voted for Ms. Noem, Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey, <a href="https://x.com/SenatorAndyKim/status/1883196775798096008/photo/2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he believed he would</a> be able to work with her and maintain an open line of communication.</p><p>Still, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/senschumer/videos/1266229234639171" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on the Senate floor</a> that he believed Ms. Noem was “headed in the wrong direction” on immigration. And Senator Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, <a href="https://x.com/SenRubenGallego/status/1883198239819866206" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he was not confident</a> Ms. Noem would respect the rule of law. Neither voted to confirm her.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Noem was grilled by lawmakers on whether she would administer disaster relief to Democratic-led states even if Mr. Trump ordered her not to. During his first term, Mr. Trump initially opposed unlocking federal funding for California after severe wildfires in 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/trump-wildfire-aid-california.html" title="">his former aides have said</a>.</p><p>“Under my leadership of the Department of Homeland Security, there will be no political bias to how disaster relief is delivered to the American people,” Ms. Noem told lawmakers, adding, “I will deliver the programs according to the law.”</p><p>She has also pledged to overhaul the Secret Service, which has struggled with attrition and has been the focus of several investigations over breakdowns that allowed a gunman to shoot at Mr. Trump, injuring him slightly, during a rally in Butler, Pa., in July.</p><p>Mr. Trump has appointed Sean Curran, who led Mr. Trump’s personal security detail during the presidential campaign, as director of the Secret Service, a position that does not require Senate confirmation.</p><p>Ms. Noem has been a champion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/kristi-noem-homeland-security.html" title="">conservative positions</a> on a number of cultural issues. She signed a law in South Dakota that bars transgender women and girls from competing in school sports consistent with their gender identity, and she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wd0puWt40U" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">battled critical race theory</a>, a framework that argues racism is baked into the law and other modern institutions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/kristi-noem-homeland-security.html" title="">Many speculated</a> that her chances of being selected as Mr. Trump’s running mate were dimmed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/us/politics/kristi-noem-book-cricket-kim.html" title="">publication of her memoir</a>, “No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong With Politics and How We Move America Forward.”</p><p>Its rollout did not go well. In the book, Ms. Noem described fatally shooting her family dog, drawing bipartisan outrage. A pre-publication version of the book also included a false story about her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/us/politics/kristi-noem-book-kim-jong-un.html" title="">meeting</a> with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, during her tenure in Congress. The section was removed.</p><p>With Ms. Noem’s confirmation on Saturday, Larry Rhoden, who had <a href="https://governor.sd.gov/governor/about.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">served as her lieutenant governor</a>, was elevated to governor of South Dakota. Mr. Rhoden is a conservative Republican and former state lawmaker.</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/homeland-security-department">Homeland Security Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/kristi-noem">Kristi Noem</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
