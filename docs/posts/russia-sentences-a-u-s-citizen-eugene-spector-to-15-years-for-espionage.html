On Tuesday, the Moscow City Court convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to an additional 13 years, for a total of 15 years, at the end of a closed-door trial, according to Russian state news agencies.</p><p>Details of the charges were not made public. The case files for Mr. Spector were not available online, and The New York Times was not immediately available to identify or track down his attorney. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department.</p><p>Mr. Spector, 52, was born in Russia but later moved to the United States. Analysts said that the length and timing of his sentence could suggest that the Russian authorities might view Mr. Spector as a potential asset for future prisoner exchanges with the United States.</p></div></div>
