They are letting grasses grow longer and reducing how much they mow. They’re ripping out invasive plants, encouraging native shrubs to thrive, forgoing pesticides, and replacing manicured turfgrass with wildflower meadows.</p><p>Cemeteries have often been the largest green spaces in cities, providing vital havens for wildlife. But during the pandemic, many of them grew especially popular as spots where people could safely gather and enjoy pastoral settings. In 2020, Laurel Hill, a 265-acre historic cemetery straddling the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania, saw its attendance more than double. Green-Wood in Brooklyn, with 478 acres of rolling hills, lush plantings, thousands of trees and serene vistas, counted 200,000 new visitors.</p><p>The surge coincided with an effort underway by Green-Wood and other cemeteries to swap swaths of manicured lawns for meadows filled with wildflowers and drought resistant native shrubs. Earlier attempts to let grass grow longer at Green-Wood had been met with fierce resistance. But as people sought solace in nature during pandemic lockdowns, they brought with them a new openness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“We’ve seen a huge sea change in terms of people’s willingness to accept this,” said Joseph Charap, Green-Wood’s vice president of horticulture, as he wound his way through one of the cemetery’s new meadows one sunny day in late November, feathery goldenrod and milkweed pods catching the afternoon light. “The reaction was, ‘Oh, it’s beautiful.’”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joseph Charap, Green-Wood’s vice president of horticulture, with Sara Evans, director of the arboretum.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Milkweed seed pods in Green-Wood Cemetery.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Green-Wood is among the earliest cemeteries in the country to be modeled after rural landscapes, and to serve as an urban park. The first was Mount Auburn, founded in 1831 outside of Boston. Others include Laurel Hill in Pennsylvania and Evergreens Cemetery in Bushwick, Brooklyn. All are arboretums, filled with thousands of trees, and located in the Atlantic Flyway, a major migratory route for birds.</p><p>Each one has converted some of their land in recent years to wild, native meadows, working with a firm founded by Larry Weaner, the pioneering ecological landscape designer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I’ve been kind of blindsided by how many cemeteries reached out,” said Mr. Weaner, whose firm has worked with five cemeteries in the last five years. “There definitely is a movement afoot.”</p><p>Cemetery operators said there were myriad reasons to replace lawns or turf grass with native shrubs and other plants. Lawn mowers are loud, often polluting and heavy, compacting soil and hastening erosion. Thirsty turf grass fares poorly during the droughts that are growing longer and more intense. There is also mounting awareness of the harms from pesticides and irrigation, and a growing recognition that greener practices can help wildlife while making a cemetery more resilient to a changing climate.</p><p>Mount Auburn even has a full-time ecologist, Paul Kwiatkowski. In recent times, he said Mount Auburn has reforested pockets of land, replaced fertilizer with compost, removed invasive plants and non-native trees, and added perennial plantings to attract beneficial insects and create a food source and cover for other wildlife. One area, called Consecration Dell, was restored with trees and plantings that provide for birds, mammals, and amphibians, including spotted salamanders that live under leaf litter on its slopes. “When you’re there, you feel like you’re out in the woods,” Mr. Kwiatkowski said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-8"><div><div><picture id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Cara Buckley/The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/science/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-08/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-08-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/science/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-08/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-08-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Will Crooks for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-04-zhcb/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-04-zhcb-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-04-zhcb/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-04-zhcb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture><picture id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Bing Guan for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-03-zhcb/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-03-zhcb-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-03-zhcb/29-CLI-WILD-CEMETERIES-03-zhcb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"/></picture></div><figcaption><span>A meadow of Green-wood Cemetery; leaves of a Japanese maple changing along a trail at the Ramsey Creek Preserve in Westminster, S.C.; the trunk of a London plane tree in a rewilded area of Green-Wood Cemetery.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Cara Buckley/The New York Times; Will Crooks for The New York Times; Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The trend toward rewilding cemeteries is not limited to stately sites. In neighborhoods across Dallas, Julie Fineman, a photographer, is leading an effort, called the Constellation of Living Memorials, to transform neglected historic graveyards from weed-choked lots into wildlife habitats that help mitigate city heat.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“This is an answer to climate change, and correcting our previous disconnect with nature,” she said.</p><p>If the pandemic helped more people reconnect with nature, it also reshaped how people envisioned their own ends. Interest in “green burials,” where bodies are laid to rest without embalming fluids and in biodegradable caskets or shrouds, surged during Covid-19, said Lee Webster, past president of the Green Burial Council. According to the New Hampshire Funeral Resources, Education and Advocacy, a nonprofit organization, there now are 430 cemeteries nationwide that allow green burials, nearly a fourfold increase from 2015.</p><p>Gregg Tepper, senior horticulturist at Laurel Hill, said rising demand for green burials prompted the expansion of natural areas that benefitted birds and other wildlife. “When you enter the areas, especially in the spring and summer, they are gorgeous,” he said.</p><p>Joseph Placious, a deacon at Ascension Garden Catholic cemetery, outside Rochester, New York, said the butterfly-dotted green burial area was expanded three times in four years to keep up with demand.</p><p> “I think they find natural burial is one more way, the last way, that they can help save the earth,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Billy Campbell, an environmentally-minded medical doctor, is credited with opening the first nature preserve that doubled as a burial site, Ramsey Creek Preserve, in rural South Carolina in 1998. The site has since doubled in size to 78 acres.</p><p>One of the first people to buy a plot was a conservative “crusty old Vietnam vet,” Dr. Campbell said.</p><p>“He said,<strong> </strong>‘Look Billy, I love the woods, it’s you environmentalists I don’t like,’” Dr. Campbell recalled, adding that the man’s widow still visits the site in a car covered in stickers supporting President-elect Donald J. Trump.</p><p>“Most of the burials these days are evangelical Christians,” Dr. Campbell continued. “More than just saving the land, it’s a way of getting people to bond to the land and see it as something special.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Billy Campbell is credited with opening Ramsey Creek Preserve, the first nature preserve that doubled as a burial site, in rural South Carolina in 1998.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Will Crooks for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Joseph Charap in a wildflower meadow in Green-Wood Cemetery. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Still, the popular image of a cemetery as a place of neatly arranged rows of headstones poking out of pristine lawns is strong. The sight of unkempt grasses or plants at graveyards can be disturbing to those who interpret it as neglect and disrespect.</p><p>In 2019, Mr. Charap weathered intense blowback after he decided to stop mowing 200 acres at Green-Wood. He wanted to cut down on carbon emissions and fight invasive Bermuda grass, which thrives in disturbed soil, something graveyards have in spades. But as the grass grew long, complaints poured in about overgrown lots, weeds and obscured headstones.</p><p>“I don’t think we really consider the cognitive grip that the American lawn has on our psyches,” Mr. Charap said, as he walked along one of the cemetery’s paths. “As someone who stewards and landscapes this, ultimately I don’t want to cause any emotional distress.”</p><p>The mowing resumed.</p><p>Mr. Charap and Sara Evans, director of the arboretum, tried another tack. They used mailers, social media posts and signs to make the case for the mowing the place less. They noted that Green-Wood’s steep glacial slopes were treacherous for groundskeepers to access, and that headstones were often damaged by lawn equipment. By then, the pandemic had struck.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“It really did impact the long term receptiveness,” Ms. Evans said, on a tour of the cemetery one recent fall day.</p><p>Meadows now fill around 40 acres of the cemetery, and less frequent mowings and longer grass allowed other plants to flower, providing nectar and pollen for foraging bees and butterflies. Passing old mausoleums, Mr. Charap and Ms. Evans pointed out native trees that had self propagated, their seeds carried by birds or the wind. The cemetery staff has also planted trees native to southern climates that are drought and fire resistant, an adjustment as the planet warms.</p><p>Ms. Evans climbed a hill, one of the oldest areas in the cemetery, where Mr. Weaner’s firm designed an experimental meadow, a swaying sea of warm russets and silky browns. The meadows required no irrigation and, as they grew, several grassland bird species were spotted there.</p><p>Ms. Evans paused, and pointed out the contrast between the meadowland and a nearby stretch of headstones springing from grass turned brown by drought, a scene not unlike a suburban Halloween-themed yard.</p><p>“This is my own philosophy,” she said, as she took in the horsemint, white beardtongue, mountain mint and butterfly weed filling the meadow, “but this situation is more comforting, and makes me feel that life goes on after death.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-20"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Cara Buckley is a reporter on the climate team at The Times who focuses on people working toward climate solutions.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/cara-buckley">More about Cara Buckley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>1</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Amid the Graves, Letting Nature Take Its Course<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/green-wood-cemetery-brooklyn-ny">Green-Wood Cemetery (Brooklyn, NY)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Climate and the Environment</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Climate F.A.Q.:</strong> Do you have questions about climate change? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maine Sues Oil Companies: </strong>Maine has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/climate/maine-climate-change-oil-company-lawsuit.html">the latest state to sue oil and gas companies over climate change</a>, claiming that the companies waged a campaign to conceal the effects of fossil fuels and contributed to the state’s recent extreme weather.</p></li><li><p><strong>Taxing Animals’ Farts and Burps: </strong>Denmark is about to implement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/climate/denmark-methane-farm-animal-tax.html">the world’s first belch and manure tax</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>COP29: </strong>Negotiators at this year’s U.N. climate summit struck an agreement to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/climate/cop29-climate-talks-conclusion.html">triple the flow of money to help developing countries</a>, but only after a bitter fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask NYT Climate</strong><strong>:</strong> How can I green up my investments? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/climate/sustainable-investing-tips-fossil-fuels.html">It’s not that hard</a>, and portfolios without fossil fuels have generally performed just as well as the broader market.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
