Goma’s residents are beginning to emerge from their hiding places, desperately searching for water and food. And the Congolese military that was supposed to protect them has been vanquished.</p><p>On Thursday, in a yard outside Goma’s biggest stadium, rebels with the Rwanda-backed M23 militia loaded more than 1,000 soldiers they had captured into truck beds, where the men stood packed together. Most wore the uniforms they were captured in. Many of them were furious.</p><p>But the curses they spat were not directed at their captors; rather, at Felix Tshisekedi, the Congolese president, whom they accused of selling them out, and at the military commanders who had abandoned them. Their commanders, together with government officials, had left behind their vehicles, seen in videos and photographs, and boarded boats in the early hours of Monday morning as M23 arrived in the city, escaping across a moonlit lake while leaving their men to fight alone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Many of the soldiers in the trucks had fought on, alongside armed groups known locally as the Wazalendo. But no reinforcements had been sent.</p><p>“Tshisekedi will pay for this,” one soldier shouted.</p><p>“We’ll capture him with our own hands,” another said.</p><p>“God will pay him back,” yelled another.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01congo-scene-13-glht/01congo-scene-13-glht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01congo-scene-13-glht/01congo-scene-13-glht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01congo-scene-13-glht/01congo-scene-13-glht-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A street is littered with clothing, helmets and shoes shed by Congolese troops." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01congo-scene-13-glht/01congo-scene-13-glht-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01congo-scene-13-glht/01congo-scene-13-glht-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01congo-scene-13-glht/01congo-scene-13-glht-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01congo-scene-13-glht/01congo-scene-13-glht-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9071f429-4a4a-5174-b1ce-be819eb26b96" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A road in Goma on Wednesday was littered with equipment abandoned by the Congolese Army.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Private military contractors used by the Congolese Army left the country through the border with Rwanda accompanied by M23 and U.N. soldiers on Wednesday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rebel leader, Corneille Nangaa, during a news conference on Thursday in Goma.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>A commander of the 231st infantry battalion of the Congolese Army — known by its French acronym, F.A.R.D.C. — climbed down from the cabin of one of the trucks, where his seniority had earned him a comfortable spot. The captured commander, Lt. Col. John Asegi, explained that they had no choice but to surrender. M23 was taking them somewhere to give them some training, he said, adding that they would now do whatever their new masters commanded.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“If we are sent to fight the F.A.R.D.C.,” he said, “we will fight the F.A.R.D.C.”</p><p>As the M23 rebels strode around the yard preparing for the trucks’ departure, they looked more like an army with their rocket-propelled grenades, fatigues and helmets, while the Congolese soldiers looked like a tired, ragtag rebel group.</p><p>The rebels, who already control vast tracts of mineral-rich Congo, have said they plan to march to the capital, Kinshasa, nearly a thousand miles to the west, and take over the whole country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The rebels had already handed over to Rwanda hundreds of captured Romanian mercenaries who had been fighting alongside Congolese forces.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Hundreds of civilians stood around the trucks full of soldiers, watching this reversal of roles, and getting a good look at the men who were now in charge. A dozen women and children were crying inconsolably, having just spotted their husbands and fathers among the men in the trucks.</p><p>“I don’t know where they’re taking him to,” wept Marie Sifa, who had a baby girl on her back and three other children in tow. She was from Fizi, 270 miles south of Goma, she said, and she lost everything in the attack on Minova last week. They sought shelter in a school, but they could not stay.</p><p>“We have been chased out of the school,” Ms. Sifa said, crying as if she were in mourning. “How will I survive? How will I get these children back to Fizi?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Later on Thursday, a rebel leader, Corneille Nangaa, gave Goma’s citizens a taste of their new reality under the powerful militia — which <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/risk-of-regional-conflict-following-fall-of-goma-and-m23-offensive-in-the-drc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some experts say</a> counts 6,000 troops in eastern Congo, backed by up to 4,000 Rwandan troops.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Go back to normal activities,” Mr. Nangaa told Goma’s residents at a two-hour news conference at a local hotel. He was flanked by men in helmets and battle gear.</p><p>But the situation in Goma, a city built around black lava streams from a nearby live volcano, is far from normal.</p><p>Dead bodies lie in the streets. Stores, supermarkets, and humanitarian agencies’ warehouses have been looted. Cholera is breaking out. People with bullet wounds — those who survived — are finally managing to get to clinics for treatment, only to find a lack of medicine and of surgical staff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A burned-out gas station near the Goma airport on Friday.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A supermarket that was looted during clashes in Goma.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vandalized Red Cross vehicles on Friday in a parking lot near looted warehouses in Goma.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>And many families who were split up as they fled have yet to find each other.</p><p>Elysée Mopanda lost track of her two children in the chaos.

The city’s water supply, as well as its power and internet, was cut during the battle for Goma, and those who had managed to save some watched it dwindle over the week. Those who had no water tried to beg it from those who did, or paid a hawker as much as $5.20 for a jerrycan that usually costs 20 cents.</p><p>As the fighting subsided, hundreds of people have ventured to the edge of Lake Kivu to collect water, adding a little chlorine to try to keep waterborne diseases at bay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>One of those fetching water on Thursday morning was Tailor Mukendi, 13, who carried two stained yellow jerrycans to the lakeshore, took off his flip-flops, and plunged into the shimmering lake.
