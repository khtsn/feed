A flurry of messages from her friends alerted her that martial law had been declared in South Korea and soldiers were breaking into the National Assembly.</p><p>Ms. Lee, who like others her age entered adulthood largely detached from politics, dismissed the notion that there could really be a military dictatorship, and she went to bed.</p><p>Everything changed the next day. As her Yonsei University classmates talked nonstop about what had happened, they shared videos of soldiers clashing with lawmakers, and news articles about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law.html" title="">military generals testifying</a> before Parliament. After seeing that other campuses were galvanizing protesters, she felt compelled to act.</p><p>By Saturday, Ms. Lee had persuaded four friends to join her and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-protests-president-impeach.html" title="">tens of thousands</a> of others to demand President Yoon Suk Yeol’s removal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-protests-seoul-yoon.html" title="">outside the National Assembly</a>, while a vote on an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/04/world/asia/south-korea-impeachment-vote-president-yoon.html" title="">impeachment motion</a> was underway inside.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The martial law declaration has forced me to realize that democracy is important,” she said after the protest, and that it is also fragile.</p></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-3"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-02-bmpv/00skorea-youth-02-bmpv-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“The laws and procedures that we have set up can be destroyed in an instant.”</p><p>Lee Suyoon</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Yoon’s attempt to suspend the country’s democracy has given rise to a new group of politically active South Koreans. They belong to a generation often criticized for its political apathy — one that hasn’t been exposed to the dark days of military rule before the late 1980s that the country’s older generation remembers all too well.</p><p>In the past week, the protest crowds have been younger than they often have been in recent years: People in their late teens and 20s joined people their parents’ and grandparents’ age, all spooked and angered by the president’s brazen action. They infused the street protests with energy, erupting in cheers when organizers blasted the latest pop songs. They waved their K-pop light sticks and made protest anthems go viral online.</p><p>Shin Yu-jin, 26, a landscape architect, was among the thousands of first-time demonstrators. She also had initially dismissed the martial law declaration. But seeing friends on Instagram who were out protesting that Saturday, she promptly set out to join them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It was my day off, and I didn’t have anything to do,” she said. “Yoon Suk Yeol made such a grave decision on his own to shake up the whole country for no valid reason, so I was furious.”</p><p>She was unprepared for the frigid temperatures: She only brought one hand warmer. But she was pleasantly surprised to see so many other women around her age.</p><p>As she watched some lawmakers leave the Assembly floor instead of voting, saving Mr. Yoon from impeachment, she said she cried, overcome by a sense of betrayal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-7"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-04-bmpv/00skorea-youth-04-bmpv-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“I’ll definitely be there every Saturday until he’s impeached.”</p><p>Shin Yu-jin</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>More experienced protesters in the past week noticed the demographic shift from the crowds that gathered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html" title="">eight years ago</a> to demand the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. While those were some of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/asia/korea-park-geun-hye-protests.html" title="">largest demonstrations ever seen</a> in South Korea, what’s at stake is different this time: democracy itself.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Choi Suk-hwan, 44, a volunteer leader at the protests in Seoul, said that he felt a kinship with those who were part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/asia/photos-1980-south-korea-martial-law.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">pro-democracy struggle</a> of the 1980s, an era from which he said much of South Korea’s protest culture originated. For him, the past week’s rallies were a chance for him to help pass on that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/world/asia/south-korea-protests.html" title="">tradition</a> to younger people.</p><p>“Each generation teaches the next,” he said, after directing volunteers to hand out thousands of candles and fliers near City Hall.</p><p>Today’s teens and people in their 20s are contemporaries of the 250 students who died in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/world/asia/south-korea-sewol-ferry-grief.html" title="">Sewol ferry disaster</a> in 2014 and many of the nearly 160 people killed in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/world/asia/seoul-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html" title="">crowd crush in Itaewon</a> around Halloween in 2022. Both tragedies might have galvanized them to join ensuing protests had they not been too young or too occupied with their studies to do so.</p><p>Instead, before last week, Ms. Lee and her university peers were wary of talking openly about politics. Neutrality was a virtue, so as not to start bitter arguments in a country where politics have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/world/asia/south-korea-election-yoon.html" title="">very polarized</a>.</p><p>All that changed after six hours of martial law made her and her friends realize that the democracy hard-won by earlier generations was at risk. There was a consensus that it shouldn’t be allowed to happen again, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Part of that consensus, she said, came from the fact that the country’s days of military rule had — until late last Tuesday — been consigned to the history books. The school curriculum includes lessons about the last time martial law was imposed, when paratroopers beat and killed as many as hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in the city of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/martial-law-south-korea-history.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">Gwangju in 1980</a>.</p><p>Recent movies that depict the era of military rule — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/asia/south-korea-taxi-driver-film-gwangju.html" title="">“A Taxi Driver,”</a> “12.12: The Day,” “1987: When the Day Comes” — had helped teach her generation what her country had lived through before democracy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Young faces in a crowd of people holding up posters and waving light sticks." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv/00skorea-youth-05-bmpv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a15a4bd8-fb74-5751-8a94-4b362c8b78d2" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters waiting for lawmakers to meet and vote on Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment near the National Assembly in Seoul on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

She said that it was unlike him to be vocal about politics.</p><p>But the president’s declaration of martial law was a turning point for him and many of his peers to become more politically involved. Mr. Kwon said that his recent experience in the army, into which he was drafted like all South Korean men, had made him wary of the risks of letting the military run civilian life.</p><p>“Once you’re in that system, you have to follow orders, no matter what you think,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-17"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-07-bmpv/00skorea-youth-07-bmpv-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“I was terrified by the idea that the military could control not only the National Assembly but universities, city halls and other public spaces.”</p><p>Kwon Min-jae</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>He convinced another classmate, Goh Hee-seung, 23, to join. Mr. Goh, who had voted for Mr. Yoon in the 2022 election, said that he was initially unsure about joining but decided he would regret staying on the sidelines.</p><p>“I thought it would be irresponsible not to go to a protest calling for the impeachment of a president I helped elect,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Goh said that attending the protest had given him a political identity crisis. After watching the lawmakers from the ruling People Power Party sit out the impeachment vote, he felt he could no longer support it.</p><p>“Something absurd has just happened, and something absurd is happening to back it,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-21"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/00skorea-youth-09-bmpv/00skorea-youth-09-bmpv-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></p><div><p>“I felt betrayed by the lawmakers who seemed more greedy to keep their power than they cared about the people of the country.”</p><p>Goh Hee-seung</p></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Goh added that he would likely vote for a third-party candidate in the next election, repeating a common sentiment: Many people favor neither Mr. Yoon nor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/asia/south-korea-lee-jae-myung-martial-law.html" title="">Lee Jae-myung</a>, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party who would be most likely to win if a presidential election were held now.</p><p>After news broke at around 9:30 p.m. that the impeachment effort on Saturday had failed, protesters began dispersing. The disappointed group of classmates huddled together, at a park near the National Assembly in the freezing cold, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Most agreed to go for drinks afterward and discuss their next move.</p><p>“After I finish a few exams,” Ms. Lee said, “I will continue to protest.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Yoon is a Times reporter based in Seoul who covers breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-yoon">More about John Yoon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Chang W.
