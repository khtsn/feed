He could soon oversee some of the country’s highest-profile criminal cases.</p><p>This week, President-elect Donald J. Trump announced that Mr. Nocella was his pick to be the next U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. In a statement announcing his choice on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said Mr. Nocella had “a strong record of bringing Law and Order to the incredible people of New York.”</p><p>As a Long Island judge, Mr. Nocella has adjudicated matters like Covid-19 relief fraud and drunken-driving cases and presided over family court.</p><p>The Eastern District, where Mr. Nocella was a prosecutor decades ago, operates at a different scale: The office and its 160-some prosecutors have long pursued high-profile cases involving organized crime, national security and foreign politicians. It has won convictions in a variety of recent blockbuster cases, including against the singer R. Kelly, who was convicted of sex crimes; the disgraced former congressman George Santos; and leaders of the sex cult NXIVM.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Seth DuCharme, who served as acting U.S. attorney in 2020, said Mr. Nocella’s range of experiences, including presiding over a small court, would serve him well in the district, which he called “a friendlier version” of its more high-profile neighbor, the Southern District of New York. But he noted that Mr. Nocella was something of an outsider.</p><p>“I think that probably most of the prosecutors were surprised,” Mr. DuCharme said. “It’s not a name they’ve heard about a lot.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
