    <h1>Gun Violence Around Schools Has Risen Since the Pandemic</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The shooting, which injured at least six other people, became the latest high-profile attack to terrify children and their families. It came during a period in which overall <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/14/us/gun-homicides-data.html" title="">gun homicides</a> and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2023-active-shooter-incidents-in-the-united-states-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">active shooter incidents</a> also remain above their prepandemic levels.</p><p>School shootings make up less than 1 percent of all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/14/magazine/gun-violence-children-data-statistics.html" title="">gun deaths</a> suffered by American children. Only a small fraction of the nation’s some 130,000 elementary and secondary schools report episodes involving guns each year. The incidents are far more likely to occur outside on school property than inside schools, the database shows.</p><p>Still, hundreds of thousands of students in the nation have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/school-shootings-database/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exposed</a> to gun violence at school since the shooting at Columbine High School in 1999.</p><p>David Riedman, the founder of the database, said that researchers define shootings at schools in many different ways, “but in any one of those measures, the trend line is up.” The majority of incidents that he has tracked were escalations of disputes that turned violent, he said.</p><p>“There are more mass fatality attacks. There are more single fatality attacks,” Mr. Riedman said. “And there are more gun shots without injury on school property than there have been at any other time period since the 60s.”</p></div></div>
