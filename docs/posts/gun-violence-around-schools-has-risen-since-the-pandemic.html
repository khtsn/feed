The victims and suspects were not all minors.</p><p>They include a Memphis teenager who shot another classmate last month during a dispute in his high school parking lot; a teenage girl in Dallas who was grazed by a bullet in September when a fight broke out across the street from her school; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/apalachee-high-school-georgia-shooting.html?timespastHighlight=Apalachee,High,School" title="">the attack at Apalachee High School</a> in the same month that killed two students and two teachers in Winder, Ga.</p><p>From 2010 and 2019, the annual figure did not exceed 30.</p><p>The uptick in school gun violence re-entered the national conversation this week after the authorities said a 15-year-old student opened fire at a Christian school in Madison, Wis., on Monday, killing another student and a teacher.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The shooting, which injured at least six other people, became the latest high-profile attack to terrify children and their families. It came during a period in which overall <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/14/us/gun-homicides-data.html" title="">gun homicides</a> and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2023-active-shooter-incidents-in-the-united-states-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">active shooter incidents</a> also remain above their prepandemic levels.</p><p>School shootings make up less than 1 percent of all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/14/magazine/gun-violence-children-data-statistics.html" title="">gun deaths</a> suffered by American children. Only a small fraction of the nation’s some 130,000 elementary and secondary schools report episodes involving guns each year. The incidents are far more likely to occur outside on school property than inside schools, the database shows.</p><p>Still, hundreds of thousands of students in the nation have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/school-shootings-database/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exposed</a> to gun violence at school since the shooting at Columbine High School in 1999.</p><p>David Riedman, the founder of the database, said that researchers define shootings at schools in many different ways, “but in any one of those measures, the trend line is up.” The majority of incidents that he has tracked were escalations of disputes that turned violent, he said.</p><p>“There are more mass fatality attacks. There are more single fatality attacks,” Mr. Riedman said. “And there are more gun shots without injury on school property than there have been at any other time period since the 60s.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There is no single explanation for the uptick. But researchers who study gun violence believe that the rise in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/18/us/firearm-gun-sales.html" title="">firearm sales</a> over the past decade, the prevalence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/health/gun-storage-homes-children.html" title="">unsecured guns</a> in homes where children live and the rise in people bringing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/10/10/guns-schools-us-increased-prevention-violence/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guns to campuses</a> may all contribute to the problem.</p><p>“It’s complicated,” Mr. Riedman said, “and there’s not just one clear factor.”</p><p>In 2020, guns became the leading cause of death among children under 18. A <a href="https://counciloncj.org/trends-in-juvenile-offending-what-you-need-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> by the Council on Criminal Justice found that while overall juvenile crime declined between 2016 and 2022, the number of homicides perpetrated by youths jumped 65 percent, and their use of guns also increased 21 percent over that period.</p><p>Shaila Dewan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Troy Closson is a Times education reporter focusing on K-12 schools.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/troy-closson">More about Troy Closson</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/columbine-high-school">Columbine High School</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
