Prices varied depending on loyalty status, ranging from $550 or 75,000 miles to $650 to 85,000 miles annually. </p><p>Now, United is introducing a two-tiered membership plan. The individual membership, which allows one member unlimited entry only to United Club locations, will cost $750 or 94,000 miles. The All Access membership will be $1,400 or 175,000 miles and covers two adults (or an adult and dependent children) and provides entry to Star Alliance and other partner lounges. Discounts are available for <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/mileageplus/premier.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elite status holders</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For <a href="https://www.theexplorercard.com/rewards-cards/club-card?CELL=1y0&amp;int_source=loyalty&amp;mode=d&amp;int_medium=dotcom&amp;int_campaign=0437&amp;alm=13111&amp;partner_category=cc&amp;partner_name=chase_acq&amp;asset_type=club_page&amp;asset_position=clbmbrpg&amp;promo_code=cell_1y0&amp;targeting=general&amp;launch_date=2024-12-13" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Club credit card holders</a>, who used to pay a $525 annual fee, club membership has been free. The annual fee has increased, as of today, to $695. The United Club Business Card, which <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/credit-card-showdown-united-business-credit-cards/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously cost $450</a> and also included free club membership, will also be $695. </p><p>The airline said in an email to customers that the Club membership changes were designed to “keep improving your experience,” noting that the new tiers were “tailored to your travel needs.” The new policies go into effect Monday, but current members won’t see immediate changes; their benefits remain until their membership expires.</p><p>While the United Club membership will remain complimentary for United Club or United Club Business cardholders, they will get entry for one guest and dependents under 18 at United Clubs, but not at Star Alliance and other partner lounges. Cardholders will unlock All Access membership if they spend $50,000 on their cards each year, or if they are <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/mileageplus/premier.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elite status holders</a> with the airline.</p><p>The popularity of airport lounges has increased in recent years, perhaps fueled by the pandemic and traveler desire for more physical space.</p><p>Travelers are visiting lounges in greater numbers and even arriving at the airport earlier to enjoy these spaces, said Jeremy Dalkoff, a vice president at <a href="https://www.collinsongroup.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Collinson International</a>, a company that operates <a href="https://www.prioritypass.com/airport-lounges" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Priority Pass lounges</a> and other lounge locations. Collinson reported 30 percent growth last year in lounge and travel experience visits, including sleep and spa bookings, compared to the same period in 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some travelers have complained that lounges are overcrowded and no longer feel exclusive. That has led some operators to restrict who can enter and how often they can visit. In February, Delta Air Lines introduced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/13/delta-makes-it-harder-to-get-into-airport-lounges.html#:~:text=Raising%20the%20bar%20on%20Sky,in%20conjunction%20with%20American%20Express." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new restrictions for its Sky Club lounges</a>, limiting cardholders who previously had unfettered entry. As of January, Capital One <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/learn-grow/more-than-money/airport-lounge-access/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no longer gives certain cardholders free entry</a> to its lounges.</p><p>At the same time, operators such as other credit card-issuing banks have entered the industry or opened more lounges, and are competing with airlines for travelers. Last year, <a href="https://upgradedpoints.com/news/new-chase-sapphire-lounges/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chase Sapphire opened lounges</a> in Phoenix and San Diego and, more recently, it opened one <a href="https://media.chase.com/news/chase-sapphire-lounge-by-the-club-phl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Philadelphia</a>. Capital One opened a <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/capital-one-las-lounge/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lounge in Las Vegas</a> last month.</p><p>About 40 percent of lounge visits are driven by co-branded credit cards like those offered by the airlines, followed by 35 percent of entries from a lounge membership, according to a March 2024 analysis by industry consulting firm <a href="https://ideaworkscompany.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IdeaWorks</a>. Day pass visits generally represent the smallest slice of lounge visits.</p><p>Lounges are “becoming branding icons to attract premium class passengers and to grow co-branded credit card portfolios,” <a href="https://ideaworkscompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Airport-Lounges-are-the-Hottest-Ticket.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the report</a> said.</p><p><strong><em>Follow New York Times Travel </em></strong><em>on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimestravel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/traveldispatch" title=""><em>sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter</em></a><em> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.
