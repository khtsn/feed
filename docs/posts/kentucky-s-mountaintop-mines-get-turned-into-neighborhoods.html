    <h1>Kentucky’s Mountaintop Mines Get Turned Into Neighborhoods</h1>

From the window, the neat row of houses in soft blues, reds and greens could unspool along any gravel road.</p><p>But stepping onto the back porch, things change. The wind gusts in. The yard is hard-packed, rocky and treeless. The lawn of struggling grass seed suddenly drops off at the edge of a narrow plateau. The land then spills precipitously down into a valley hundreds of feet below before rising back up to another island in the sky.</p><p>Decades ago, a cheap form of extraction called mountaintop removal coal mining leveled mountains and shoved the detritus — sugar maples, salamanders, song birds — down hill. While federal law required these moonscapes to be leveled and replanted, reclaimed strip mines no longer resemble mountains. Instead of lush eastern woodlands, they look more like dry western plains.</p><p>But in a region defined by steep slopes, these ecological graveyards also provide a startling solution to a problem plaguing residents in the narrow valleys below: the floods.</p><p>In 2022, apocalyptic flooding swept across eastern Kentucky, killing 45 people, destroying 542 homes and damaging thousands more. Now, instead of rebuilding in the floodplain, the state is permanently lifting residents onto safer land. Officials are more than two years into a nearly $800 million plan to reclaim these landscapes again, turning them from deserts into developments.</p><p>“Climate change is real,” Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky, said in an interview last month. “It’s hard to say which natural disaster would or would not have occurred without climate change, because we’ve had some big ones in the past. But what we know is that we see them more often, and sadly, we see them hit a lot of the same places.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An aerial view of roads and houses flooded with brown water." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft/00cli-ky-housing-04-jhft-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/19226eee-ce6e-5cf8-b35e-f548021eaa32" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flooding of the North Fork of the Kentucky River in Jackson, Ky., in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leandro Lozada/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-2"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. “The dirt where we’re from is pretty important to us,” he said, “but the thing that makes people willing to move is the safety of their families.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Seven communities across four counties, with aspirational names like Skyview and Olive Branch, have been designed for <a href="https://hdahome.org/disaster-recovery/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">665 brand-new properties</a>, some of which will run on solar. Fourteen houses have been completed and about a dozen people have moved in to two communities called Thompson Branch and Wayland, according to the state.</p><p>As greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, including coal, continue to heat the atmosphere, contributing to bigger fires, more severe floods and rising sea levels, people have been forced to abandon places they once called home. Climate migration has already reached places like Louisiana, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/resettling-the-first-american-climate-refugees.html" title="">low-lying communities like the Isle de Jean Charles</a> are being forcibly abandoned.</p><p>But relocation is complicated by the shifting dynamics of where people want to live.

But around 1 a.m. on July 28, 2022, she noticed water pooling on the kitchen floor. When she peered out her carport, an ocean appeared to engulf her house.</p><p>Minutes later, water burst through her vents, quickly rising up to her chest. She scrambled onto her dryer and perched on a small oak chair, but cold water still lapped around her knees. The power went out. She lost her cellphone signal. She could hear her neighbors crying for help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kathy Thomas in her new home in the Thompson Branch subdivision in Whitesburg.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The view of construction from inside a home at the Thompson Branch subdivision in Whitesburg.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After a sleepless night, she emerged at the front door to see her parents, who were searching the neighborhood for her on a four-wheeler. They didn’t realize she could survive inside the house. When the Federal Emergency Management Agency came to assess the damage, they measured the water line at 5 feet 2 inches. Ms. Thomas is 5 foot 4 inches tall.</p><p>She had to move in with her parents for two and a half years before finding a new home. By spring, Ms. Thomas will escape the floodplain, traveling 13 miles down the state highway before ascending to Thompson Branch.</p><p>“The dirt where we’re from is pretty important to us,” Gov. Beshear said, “but the thing that makes people willing to move is the safety of their families.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h3 id="link-5a02b3d9"><span>‘You Can’t Go Back’</span></h3><p>Strip-mined mountains could now be considered safer than the valleys, where people long congregated near fertile farmland beside the riverbanks. In a region where flat property has always been scarce, and many residents suffer from persistent poverty often blamed on the boom and bust of coal extraction, moving out of the floodplain has been cost-prohibitive.</p><p>“When you live in this part of the country, there’s good and bad that comes with mining,” said Seth Long, the executive director of HOMES, Inc., a nonprofit housing developer responsible for the 10 homes at Thompson Branch. “You take what it is, and you redeem it. You can’t go back.”</p><p>Mark Arnold, a landscape architect who designed five of the high ground sites where more than 600 homes are planned, including Thompson Branch, plans to incorporate the place-based culture of floodplain communities. His vision — small clusters of houses, eventually enveloped by reforested land — would emphasize the importance of family and neighborliness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Seth Long, the executive director of HOMES, Inc. “Everyone makes use of the flat ground one way or another,” he said. “You take what it is, and you redeem it.

All 10 homes at Thompson Branch will have solar panels installed and in an area where electricity can cost hundreds of dollars, homeowners should pay just $21.50 per month, according to Mr. Long. While there’s a history of heavy sports facilities, schools and hotels that become structurally unsound as the strip mine settles, lighter construction shouldn’t face the same problems, according to Scott McReynolds, the executive director of the Housing Development Alliance, a nonprofit developer based in eastern Kentucky.</p><p>“There’s been a lot of single family homes developed on strip mines and when they’re done correctly and thoughtfully, it’s a reasonable risk,” Mr. McReynolds said. “Nothing around here is foolproof.”</p><p>The high ground subdivisions underwent geotechnical surveys before they were approved for development. Some structural reinforcements were required, and engineers bored holes into the ground to analyze soil composition, designating some patches too unstable for construction.</p><p>In these open spaces, Mr. Arnold instead planned parks, playgrounds, and trail systems to help connect the community to their neighbors and to the second-life of the land.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Early construction on the Skyview subdivision in Hazard.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Scott McReynolds, the executive director of the Housing Development Alliance. “Nothing around here is foolproof,” he said.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h3 id="link-7010f467"><span>A Crisis Decades in the Making</span></h3><p>Eastern Kentucky’s housing crisis predated the flood by decades. The shortage of buildable land, plus properties held by out-of-state state coal companies, meant there were few places to build. High costs and low appraisals also made for-profit development prohibitively expensive.</p><p>“I’ve heard it said that the flood was the worst, best thing that ever happened to us,” said Mr. Long of HOMES, Inc. Federal programs provided 9 out of every 10 dollars the state planned on investing in high ground housing.</p><p>But that investment has taken time to arrive. Nonprofits have waited almost three years for payments to come through. Infrastructure like sewer and water lines at these tucked away sites is expensive, according to developers and the state. Plus, the destruction was so widespread, a 2024 study <a href="https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/housing-rebuild-after-kentucky-flood-still-lacks-funds/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated $600 million more is needed</a> to provide new, safe homes for 3,000 families.</p><p>“The state is really committed, but some of us wonder whether there will actually be enough money,” Mr. McReynolds said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>A three bedroom, two bathroom home in the region typically appraises around $180,000 — $200,000 and most homeowners require a combination of assistance programs and personal financing. Ms. Thomas purchased her new house with two federal buyouts (for her home and her father’s, which was also destroyed in the flood) as well as loans. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Lower River Caney in Lost Creek, which flooded in 2022.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“People will say, why don’t you just move?” said Sherry Mullins, who now lives in the Blue Sky subdivision.  </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“People will say, why don’t you just move?” said Sherry Mullins, who retired from a career with the United States Department of Agriculture a month before the flood destroyed her home in a hollow called River Caney. “You could go to these higher ground communities, but here’s the thing, you got to be able to afford to do that.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Even if all the homes are built and people can afford them, there’s still a question of whether people will move.</p><p>In January, a regional housing network called FAHE, in conjunction with the state, opened a program to match flood survivors and residents with a case manager. Within the first month 99 people applied.</p><p>But some residents won’t want to leave generational land and for those who have, it can be difficult to adjust to life on higher ground. After Ms. Mullins lost her double-wide trailer, she moved onto another strip mine development that predated the 2022 flood called Blue Sky.</p><p>There she suffered another loss when her husband of 37 years, George, died after breaking his hip and struggling with his mental health. “He just could not adapt, and he regressed every day after the flood,” Ms. Mullins said.</p><p>But residents want to escape future floods and keep their families safe.</p><p>For developers, that means keeping long-term adaptation under climate change at the forefront of creating these new communities.</p><p>“We’re trying to figure out how to make sure our housing is resilient housing, and that it’s going to stand the test of time,” said Mindy Miller, communications and development director at the Housing Development Alliance. “We’re not just rebuilding for the next year, we’re trying to rebuild forever.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial for Vanessa Baker, who died in the flooding in 2022, near the Lower River Caney in Lost Creek. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Austyn Gaffney is a reporter covering climate and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
