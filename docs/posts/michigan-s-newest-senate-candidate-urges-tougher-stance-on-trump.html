Democrats are hoping to retain the seat, now held by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/gary-peters-michigan-senate-2026.html" title="">Senator Gary Peters</a>, who is retiring.</p><p>“We need to break the chokehold that billionaires and oligarchs like Donald Trump and Elon Musk have on our politics and economy,” he said in a statement as he announced his candidacy. “It’s not just about what we’re fighting against. It’s about what we fight for.”</p><p>Yet even as he name-checked his policy goals around the economy, the environment and guaranteed health care, Dr. El-Sayed, 40, also made clear this week that he hoped to tap into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/republicans-town-halls.html" title="">fury of Democrats</a> who are horrified by President Trump’s actions and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/democrats-trump.html" title="">frustrated with their party’s inability</a> to curb his powers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They want somebody who can take the fight openly, honestly and clearly and directly to Trump and Musk, but also somebody who can build from the wreckage that they leave behind,” he said in an interview, alluding in part to Mr. Musk’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/musk-federal-bureaucracy-takeover.html" title="">efforts to gut</a> the federal government.</p><p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/elections/republican-house-trifecta.html" title="">Republicans control</a> the House and the Senate, and Democrats in Washington are severely limited in their ability to rein in the majority party, much less advance their own agenda. </p><p>“Right now is the ‘fight’ part,” Dr. El-Sayed said when asked about those constraints. “When we retake the majority, that’s going to be the ‘build’ part.”</p><p>In the meantime, he suggested, Democrats across the board should be speaking up far more forcefully. Dr. El-Sayed pointed to a few Trump critics who, he said, were doing that effectively, including Senator Bernie Sanders, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/bernie-sanders-socialism.html" title="">democratic socialist</a> from Vermont who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-trump-democrats.html" title="">holding rallies across the country</a> and is expected to endorse Dr. El-Sayed. He also mentioned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/chris-murphy-democrats-trump.html" title="">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/booker-senate-trump.html" title="">Senator Cory Booker</a> of New Jersey, who delivered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/cory-booker-speech-reactions.html" title="">25-hour tirade</a> against the president and his administration.</p><p>“Senators have an incredible platform,” Dr. El-Sayed said, adding that Michigan residents were asking of their elected officials: “When are you going to step up and represent me? When are you going to speak out? When are you going to engage?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Sometimes,” he said, “people get into positions of power, and then mistake procedure for fighting.”</p><p>If he were in office today, Dr. El-Sayed said, he would hold town halls across the state and seek out tactics in the Senate “to lay the mayhem that Trump and Musk are causing at their feet.”</p><p>Dr. El-Sayed, who has been a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/21/el-sayed-endorses-sanders-presidentel-sayed-endorses-sanders-for-president/4252714002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vocal supporter</a> of Mr. Sanders, finished second in the 2018 Democratic primary for governor, losing to Gretchen Whitmer, the eventual general-election winner, who had staked out more centrist territory.</p><p>This time around, he will face opponents including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/michigan-senate-democrats-mallory-mcmorrow.html" title="">State Senator Mallory McMorrow</a>, a Democrat from the Detroit suburbs. Representative Haley Stevens, another Democrat from outside Detroit, could also enter the race.</p><p>On the Republican side, former Representative Mike Rogers, who narrowly lost Michigan’s Senate race last fall to Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, announced this week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/mike-rogers-senate-michigan.html" title="">he was running again</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some Democrats have argued that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/democrats-trump-agenda-policies.html" title="">biggest battles</a> in the party’s primaries will not be over ideology, as recent races have been, but rather over how, and how hard, to push back against the Trump administration.</p><p>But in Michigan, there will certainly be room for policy clashes over issues including the Middle East, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/michigan-harris-arab-muslim-jewish-voters.html" title="">particularly sensitive subject</a> in a state that is home to significant Arab American, Muslim and Jewish communities.</p><p>During the presidential primary last year, Dr. El-Sayed protested the Biden administration’s support of Israel in the Gaza war by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=939323080898307&amp;id=100044618700977&amp;set=a.413309743499646" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voting “uncommitted.”</a> But, he was quick to note, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the general election.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katie Glueck is a Times national political reporter.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/gary-peters">Gary Peters</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Showdown with Courts: </strong>By refusing to return a deported migrant, President Trump is flirting with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-defy-courts.html">a lawless defiance of court orders</a>, scholars say.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
