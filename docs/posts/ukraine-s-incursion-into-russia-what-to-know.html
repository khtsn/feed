But military analysts say that it has since poured more troops into the operation to try to hold and expand its positions. </p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-535c2c43">How far into Russia have Ukrainian troops advanced?</h2><p>Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s top commander, said last week that his army now controlled more than 80 Russian settlements in the Kursk region, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-airfields-kursk.html" title="">including Sudzha</a>, a town of 6,000 residents. His claims could not be independently verified, although analysts say that Sudzha is highly likely to be under full Ukrainian control.</p><p>Ukraine’s advance in the Kursk region has slowed in recent days, according to <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open-source</a> <a href="https://deepstatemap.live/en#10/51.1913939/35.3553772" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maps of the battlefield</a> based on combat footage and satellite images, as Russia sends in more reinforcements.

Those, however, were smaller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks-putin.html" title="">forays by Russian exile groups</a> backed by the Ukrainian army, and they ended in quick retreats.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Until two weeks ago, Ukrainian forces had not counterattacked in Russia. The gains in Kursk are the quickest for Ukrainian forces since they reclaimed the Kherson region of their own country in November 2022.</p><h2 id="link-1b5ba42f">How has the Kremlin responded?</h2><p>As Ukrainian forces pushed deeper into Russia, Moscow scrambled to shore up its defenses, and President Vladimir V. Putin convened his security services to coordinate a response. The <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/975832" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russian military</a> said it was sending more troops and armored vehicles to try to repel the attack, with <a href="https://t.me/zvezdanews/147567" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russian television</a> broadcasting images of columns of military trucks.</p><p>Military analysts and U.S. officials have said the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-incursion-putin.html" title="">Russian command</a> had so far brought in reinforcements mainly from within Russia so as to not deplete its units on the Ukrainian battlefield, in what they described as a disorganized effort.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An army recruiting poster in Kursk last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>“Russia is still pulling together its reaction,” Gen.
