Trump has the edge in Georgia and Nevada:</p><p><strong>Arizona</strong>: Harris 50, Trump 45</p><p><strong>Georgia</strong>: Trump 50, Harris 46</p><p><strong>Nevada</strong>: Trump 48, Harris 47</p><p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Harris 49, Trump 47</p><p>I wouldn’t dwell too much on the precise results by state. On their own, each state poll is relatively inexact and subject to lots of uncertainty. Instead, focus on the big picture: Across the four states, it’s a dead heat. And a dead heat in these four states is not great news for Mr. Trump, who may need to take all three of Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona to win in November.</p><p>A year or two ago, a dead heat across the Sun Belt might have been a ho-hum finding. In the 2020 election, President Biden won by 0.4 points on average across these four states; coincidentally, the Times/Siena poll finds Ms. Harris ahead, on average, by 0.4 points.</p><p>But a dead heat is a big deal today. It represents a huge shift from earlier in the cycle, when Mr. Trump’s relative strength over Mr. Biden among young, Black and Hispanic voters had propelled him to a surprising lead across these relatively young and diverse states. In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" title="">last round</a> of Times/Siena polls in May, Mr. Trump led Mr. Biden by an average of 10 points among likely voters across Georgia, Nevada and Arizona — three states Mr. Biden won narrowly in 2020. It left Mr. Biden with a narrow path to victory, requiring a sweep of the relatively white Northern battleground states.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Today, the numbers look “normal” again and the Sun Belt path is back in play for Ms. Harris. Not only do the top-line results resemble those of the last election, but many of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/upshot/biden-trump-black-hispanic-voters.html" title="">unusual demographic patterns</a> of the Biden-Trump matchup have also faded.</p><p>Ms. Harris has an 84-11 lead among Black voters in Georgia and North Carolina, the two battleground states where Black voters represent their largest share of the electorate. No one would have batted an eye at a result like this a year or two ago, but it’s a significant improvement from Mr. Biden’s 74-17 lead in May in Georgia and his 74-18 lead across our final five national polls of his campaign.</p><p>Ms. Harris has taken the clear lead among young and Hispanic voters as well. Hispanic voters give her a 54-40 edge in Arizona and Nevada, the two swing states where Hispanic voters represent their largest share of the electorate, up from Mr. Biden’s narrow 47-43 lead in May. The story is similar among young voters (18 to 29), who give Ms. Harris a 55-39 lead across all four states.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Ms. Harris is still polling a bit beneath the 60-or-so percent of the vote that Democrats usually win among young and Hispanic voters in these states, even if it’s far better than where Mr. Biden stood in May. And even Ms. Harris’s edge among Black voters is still a tad lower than one would typically expect for a Democrat in these states.</p><p>It’s possible that the race will continue to drift toward usual demographic lines as November nears. Or maybe the final results will actually look somewhat like this, and the modest racial and generational depolarization of the last decade will take another incremental step forward, despite a younger and Black Democrat at the top of the ticket.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 id="link-370cdad8"><span>Is North Carolina really that far left of Georgia?</span></h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t dwell too much on the exact results by state. But if you’re a political junkie, you might have found it hard to resist.</p><p>The results by state are a little head-scratching — especially compared with last week’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/harris-trump-battleground-polls.html" title="">Northern battleground polls</a>, which showed three identical 50-46 Haris leads. North Carolina, the only state of the bunch that voted for Mr. Trump in 2020, gives Ms. Harris a modest two-point lead. Mr. Trump, in contrast, holds a four-point lead in Georgia — a six-point gap between the two states.</p><p>Is North Carolina really a net six points better for Ms. Harris than Georgia? Probably not, but it’s always hard to figure out whether a poll might be “right” or “wrong,” and here we’re talking about just two state polls, each subject to error simply by chance.</p><p>Here’s how I’m thinking about the results in both states.</p><p><strong>Georgia: </strong>Of the two polls, the Georgia one is slightly easier for us to interpret. It’s our third Georgia poll of the cycle, so we can at least put it in context.</p><p>In our previous two polls, Georgia backed Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden by an average of seven points — placing the state three points to the right of the other states we polled. That Republican lean made sense given what we know about its demographics: Georgia is the most diverse battleground, and Mr. Biden was underperforming among nonwhite voters.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The even greater Republican lean today, however, seems a bit at odds with our prior polling of Georgia and our results elsewhere in the battlegrounds. With Ms. Harris faring better among nonwhite voters, Georgia might have been expected to move closer to the center of the battlegrounds, not to their right. And there are a few underlying numbers that suggest we reached more Trump supporters in this poll than we had in previous ones: By <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/upshot/polls-trump-harris.html" title="">recalled vote</a>, for instance, it had the best result for Mr. Trump in 2020 of any Georgia poll this cycle, or any of the other state polls in this wave.</p><p>Is it possible that Georgia has moved farther to the right? Perhaps. But it’s possible that if we re-polled Georgia tomorrow, we would find Ms. Harris doing better, simply by chance. (Note: I am not suggesting that the Georgia poll is “wrong.” It’s entirely possible that if the election were held tomorrow, this Georgia poll would be very close to the actual result, while our other poll results would underestimate Mr. Trump.)</p><p>The same reasoning suggests we could find Ms. Harris doing worse if we re-polled Arizona — where, unlike in our previous polls, she’s ahead by five points, her biggest edge among the seven states we recently polled.</p><p><strong>North Carolina: </strong>This is our first poll of the state this cycle, so it’s harder to know what to expect. One warning sign: Unlike in our other polls of late, white Democrats in North Carolina were much more likely to respond (39 percent likelier) than white Republicans. In comparison, white Democrats were just 2 percent likelier to respond than Republicans in Arizona, where Ms. Harris fared best in the survey. This doesn’t prove the poll is wrong (nor does the parity in response rates show the Arizona poll is right), but this lopsided partisan difference in response rates is what we saw ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>That said, the Times/Siena poll isn’t alone in showing Ms. Harris with strength in the Tar Heel state: A Cook Political Report <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/survey-research/2024-swing-state-project/14Aug2024-toplines" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> fielded by two professional partisan firms found Ms. Harris up by one point there.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It’s easy to forget, but North Carolina voted for Mr. Trump by just 1.35 points <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-north-carolina.html" title="">in 2020</a>. Mr. Biden’s victory in Georgia may make it seem that it’s very different from North Carolina, but it’s really not. There’s only a 1.6-point gap. Democratic candidates for House actually did better in North Carolina than Georgia in the midterms, for example, even though the Black turnout in North Carolina was especially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/upshot/midterms-election-black-turnout.html" title="">low</a>.</p><p>How might North Carolina be more Democratic than Georgia in 2024? Here are two quick theories:</p><ul><li><p>White voters represent a larger share of the electorate in North Carolina than in Georgia. In polling so far, Ms. Harris continues to run ahead of Biden’s 2020 numbers among white voters and behind among nonwhite voters. If so, Ms. Harris would be expected to fare relatively better in North Carolina than Georgia.</p></li><li><p>Democratic victories in Georgia may be more dependent on winning over relatively conservative, affluent “Never Trump” Republicans, and Ms. Harris could find that more challenging than Mr. Biden would have. Ms. Harris does fare worse among self-identified conservatives across our polls, even as she fares better among other kinds of white voters (say, young white women).</p></li></ul><p>I don’t know if you found those theories convincing or not. But if you don’t, it’s OK — I’m not sure I found them terribly convincing, either. Still, much crazier things have happened than North Carolina nudging itself 1.6 points to Georgia’s left. States are idiosyncratic in ways we don’t entirely understand, with unpredictable consequences.</p><p>For example, simple demographic breakdowns don’t explain why Florida has veered to the right while Arizona has shifted left over the last 10 years. On paper, they’re not very different! They don’t explain why Ohio became noncompetitive while Democrats hold their own in Pennsylvania. Even on election night in 2020, there were people saying it didn’t make sense that Mr. Biden would win Georgia because he had already lost North Carolina and Florida — two states that were more Democratic in 2016 and more Democratic in the pre-election polls and forecasts.</p><h3 id="link-de7db9"><span>One thing that’s not back to normal</span></h3><p>One unusual feature of the polling this cycle is that Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/upshot/election-democrats-republicans-turnout-trump.html" title="">had been doing</a> better among likely voters than the broader group of all registered voters.</p><p>That’s still true here. Like Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris leads narrowly among voters who say they’re very likely to vote, but she trails by double digits among those who say they’re unlikely to vote.</p></div></div><div><p>Pooling all seven of our battleground state polls together, Ms. Harris leads by two points among those who are “almost certain” or “very likely” to vote, while Mr. Trump leads by 10 points among the rest.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nate Cohn is The Times’s chief political analyst.
