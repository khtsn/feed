It is America’s first geopolitical rival to surpass <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN-US" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/china-still-rising" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. G.D.P</a>., <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/china-worlds-sole-manufacturing-superpower-line-sketch-rise" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceed American industrial capacity</a> and pull ahead in multiple technology sectors, such as <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/21/1068880/how-did-china-dominate-electric-cars-policy/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electric vehicles</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-12/bloomberg-evening-briefing-china-leads-the-world-in-hypersonic-technology" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hypersonic weapons</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/09/12/china-is-beating-america-in-the-nuclear-energy-race" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nuclear</a> energy technology. Absent corrective action, the United States risks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/02/china-leading-us-in-technology-race-in-all-but-a-few-fields-thinktank-finds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">falling</a> behind China <a href="https://www2.itif.org/2024-chinese-innovation-full-report.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technologically</a>, growing dependent on it economically and perhaps even suffering defeat by China’s military in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea. How the next U.S. president navigates the remaining years of this decisive decade will have far-reaching consequences for America and the rest of the world.</p><p>The good news is that despite deep divisions in American politics, Democrats and Republicans now broadly agree on the need to outcompete China. They have enacted legislation intended to boost American <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/chips-semiconductor-manufacturing-science-act/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technological</a> leadership, revive domestic <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/13/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-kicks-off-infrastructure-week-by-highlighting-historic-results-spurred-by-president-bidens-investing-in-america-agenda/#:~:text=The%20Bipartisan%20Infrastructure%20Law%20also,manufacturing%20plants%20have%20broken%20ground." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">manufacturing</a>, promote <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">human rights</a> around the world, strengthen American <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/04/house-approves-95-billion-defense-supplemental-with-aid-for-ukraine-israel-taiwan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deterrence</a> in the Taiwan Strait and bolster Asia-Pacific <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/us-congress-passes-bill-allowing-sale-of-aukus-nuclear-submarines-to-australia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alliances</a>.</p><p>That united front will be undermined if Donald Trump is elected again. Ironically, although he helped catalyze the current bipartisan approach as president by upending the long-term U.S. policy toward China that emphasized engagement over competition, he has never fully embraced the new consensus and now stands outside it. On China, he is often at odds with <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/communist-china-and-the-free-worlds-future-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/politics/bolton-book-trump/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former staff members</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74RSdJStcOc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">current</a> advisers, the <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-senate-vote-tiktok-end-ccp-spying/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nationalist wing</a> of his <a href="https://taiwannews.com.tw/news/3627164" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">party</a> and even his own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/opinion/jd-vance-interview.html" title="">vice-presidential pick</a> — all of whom see the challenge posed by Beijing more clearly than he does. Left to his own unpredictable impulses, Mr. Trump could very well lose this decisive decade for America.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nobody grasps this better than China’s leaders. They <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/10/12/china-trump-accelerating-american-decline/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saw</a> his <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-13/china-thinks-america-losing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">term</a> as an accelerant of what they believe to be American decline, and not without reason. Mr. Trump focused on U.S. commodity exports instead of long-term manufacturing strength. He alienated allies and partners, mishandled the pandemic response and repeatedly showed disregard for democratic norms. On China policy, he routinely put <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-bolton-the-scandal-of-trumps-china-policy-11592419564" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personal gain</a> over America’s interests and undermined important steps his staff members took to compete with Beijing. As a result, Mr. Trump was <a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/3108839/what-chinese-internet-calls-trump-boss-emperor-king" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">widely mocked</a> by Chinese citizens, who nicknamed him “Chuan Jianguo” (“Build-the-Nation Trump” — the “nation” being China). His administration led President Xi Jinping of China to declare that the world was undergoing “<a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/featured-excerpt-from-the-long-game-china-s-grand-strategy-to-displace-american-order" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">great changes unseen in a century</a>” as America fell from pre-eminence.</p><p>There is no reason to believe that in a second term Mr. Trump would deviate from the approach that weakened America’s position during his presidency.</p><p>Take technology policy. When Mr. Trump was in office, his administration rightly levied export controls on Huawei and ZTE, Chinese telecommunications companies that the intelligence community had warned could be vectors for <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-20-690A1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">espionage</a> and cyberattacks. But he put self-interest first. He reportedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/28/bolton-alleges-that-trump-helped-out-chinas-leader-zte-whats-zte/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promised</a> Mr. Xi he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/politics/trump-china-bolton.html" title="">lift</a> the controls (and eventually did so for ZTE, despite bipartisan opposition) in exchange for purchases of U.S. agriculture and energy commodities that he felt would help his re-election prospects.</p><p>Today Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/us/politics/trump-tiktok-ban-cnbc.html" title="">opposes</a> overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/12/tiktok-china-espionage-fears" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bipartisan legislation</a> that would ban TikTok unless the app’s China-based owners sell it. The goal is to prevent Beijing from being able to shape U.S. public opinion by manipulating the news feeds of TikTok’s 170 million American users or from having access to sensitive user data. He previously supported this approach but appears to have reversed himself after meeting with a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/03/18/billionaire-jeff-yass-may-be-the-donor-behind-trumps-tiktok-flipflop-heres-what-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top donor</a> who has a roughly $30 billion stake in the app.</p><p>President Biden has taken important steps to deny China the advanced semiconductors it needs to take the lead in artificial intelligence and improve its military weapons, and he has moved to shore up America’s defenses against Beijing’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/opening-statement-cisa-director-jen-easterly" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly documented campaign</a> to compromise critical U.S. infrastructure, such as water, gas, telecommunications and transportation, in the run-up to a possible conflict. If, in a second term, Mr. Trump again elevates his personal interests above the country’s approach to technology competition, it would put these vital efforts at risk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The story is similar in manufacturing. As <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-World-China-Made.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent report</a> by Senator Marco Rubio made clear, China already “leads in many of the industries that will determine geopolitical supremacy.” Members of both parties recognize that urgent action is needed to reindustrialize America as a new flood of Chinese exports threatens key U.S. industries.</p><p>Mr. Trump does not seem to share this view. As president, he squandered any leverage he gained from raising tariffs on China by accepting a bad trade deal that he hoped would help his re-election prospects. The deal allowed Beijing to keep its unfair practices and sell Americans manufactured goods if China promised to buy American commodities. More bad deals like that in a second term could cost millions of U.S. jobs, displace America in high-tech industry and accelerate decline by turning the United States into a commodity supplier dependent on Chinese manufactured goods.</p><p>With democracy and human rights under pressure around the world, American leadership in defending those values is imperative. Yet Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/jul/21/trump-praises-xi-jinping-and-kim-jong-un-in-michigan-rally-speech-video" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">retains</a> an affinity for authoritarian leaders like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6324651091112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Xi</a> and President Vladimir Putin of Russia that is far outside the bipartisan consensus. Mr. Trump once <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-praised-china-tiananmen-foreshadowing-response-to-george-floyd-protests-2020-6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praised China’s response</a> to the Tiananmen Square massacre and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/22/trump-says-he-might-veto-legislation-that-aims-protect-human-rights-hong-kong-because-bill-would-impact-china-trade-talks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatened to veto</a> nearly unanimous legislation condemning China’s crackdown on Hong Kong by declaring, “We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi.” According to Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/17/bolton-says-trump-didnt-just-ignore-human-rights-encouraged-chinas-concentration-camps/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">privately encouraged Mr. Xi</a> to build the re-education prisons in which China interned an estimated one million ethnic Uyghurs. A second Trump term could further greenlight China’s repression and its drive to weaken democratic values and American leadership around the world.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s ideas on Taiwan are a blueprint for calamity. For decades, Washington has deterred China from invading Taiwan with a bipartisan policy of strategic ambiguity about whether the United States would defend the island. Mr. Trump threatens to weaken that deterrence. He <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-trump-interview-transcript/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said recently</a> that Taiwan should pay the United States to defend the island, which is democratically ruled, while cavalierly casting doubt on America’s ability to do just that.</p><p>This is extremely dangerous. Telegraphing a lack of U.S. resolve could one day embolden China to seize the island, which could spark a conflict that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-01-09/if-china-invades-taiwan-it-would-cost-world-economy-10-trillion?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">devastates the global economy</a>. And Beijing has already taken notice: It is increasingly well known in Western diplomatic and scholarly circles that Chinese officials and think tank experts are quietly asking whether Mr. Trump might acquiesce to Chinese military action against Taiwan if he is re-elected.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Democrats and Republicans alike believe that strengthening America’s global alliances is one of the best ways to counter China. But Mr. Trump has shown that he still does not value America’s international friendships. He is threatening once again <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/26/not-just-china-trump-2point0-could-spell-trouble-for-us-allies-as-he-doubles-down-on-tariff-talk-.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to raise tariffs</a> on allies, make them pay more for collective defense and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/trump-russia-nato/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">renege</a> on U.S. defense commitments. Without its allies, America would stand alone against Beijing.</p><p>China is America’s most formidable geopolitical rival in a century, and thanks to Mr. Trump’s term in office, leaders in Beijing are acutely aware of what he is about and how to manipulate him. They believe China is rising and America is declining. Electing Mr. Trump next month risks proving them right.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Rush Doshi (<a href="https://x.com/RushDoshi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@RushDoshi</a>) was the deputy senior director for China and Taiwan affairs on President Biden’s National Security Council and is the author of “The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order.” He is the C.V.
