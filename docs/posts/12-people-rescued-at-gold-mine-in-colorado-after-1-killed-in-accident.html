Renee Bunting, a spokeswoman for the Teller County Sheriff’s Office, confirmed the rescue at about 7:30 p.m. local time.</p><p>The rescue caps off a multi-hour ordeal that began at around noon local time.</p><p>The authorities were scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday evening.</p><p>Teller County Sheriff’s Office received a report around noon local time that an elevator transporting visitors at Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine near Cripple Creek had malfunctioned and stopped at the midway point, according to Jason Mikesell, the Teller County sheriff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is unclear exactly what failed within the elevator trolley, or whether the people who were on the elevator at the time were going down into the mine or coming up from a tour, Sheriff Mikesell said. Officials believe the fatality happened during the malfunction. Four other people had minor injuries.</p><p>Earlier in the day, 11 other people who were in the elevator were rescued, Sheriff Mikesell said.</p><p>A tour guide who the authorities said was a member of the family who owns the mine and is an experienced former mine rescue worker was among those at the bottom.</p><p>The authorities said that the mine itself did not collapse.</p><p>Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado credited the various state and local agencies involved in the rescue efforts.</p><p>Mr. Polis offered “our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the individual lost in this incident.”</p><p>The 12 people at the bottom of the mine were aware of the elevator problem while trapped, Sheriff Mikesell said, and had chairs, blankets and water, and were communicating with the authorities using radios.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The last time a similar episode occurred was in 1986, Sheriff Mikesell said. He did not elaborate.</p><p>Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine stopped operating as a working mine in 1961 but has become a tourist attraction, where miners guide visitors on tours 1,000 feet below the earth’s surface, <a href="https://www.goldminetours.com/history.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to its website</a>. Visitors can see “exposed gold veins in their natural state,” the website says.</p><p>The mine was named after Mollie Kathleen Gortner, who became the first woman in the Cripple Creek Gold Camp to strike gold, in 1891.</p><p>Cripple Creek, <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/geo/cripple-creek-co" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a town of about 1,100 people</a>, is about 20 miles southwest of Colorado Springs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
