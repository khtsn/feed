</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The next noisiest state will be Michigan, where about $95 million will be spent on television and Democrats have a $23 million advantage. Democrats have $6 million to $15 million advantages in four big battleground states — Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin — as well as Nebraska, which is home to a single congressional district that is competitive at the presidential level. Republicans have no advertising reserved in Nebraska, while Democrats have nearly $6 million booked there through Election Day. Democrats are also set to run small amounts of ads in New Hampshire, Minnesota and Maine, which Republicans are almost entirely ignoring.</p><p>But by and large, Democrats and Republicans seem to agree about which states are the most important relative to one another: About 29 percent of Republicans’ reservations for advertising airtime are in Pennsylvania, while 23 percent of Democratic dollars are headed there. In the other battleground states, the proportion of money that each party is spending is similar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The pro-Trump outside groups have been slower to reserve advertising time, with some buying relatively last-minute ads that can be much more expensive than the reservations made further in advance. The three main pro-Trump outside groups — MAGA Inc., Preserve America PAC and Right for America PAC — have reserved a combined $95 million over that period, less than half the amount reserved by Democratic outside groups.</p><p>Still, the sums reserved by Republicans could change quickly given that several groups are heavily financed by single billionaire donors, such as Miriam Adelson and Timothy Mellon, meaning that a super PAC could quickly secure and spend significant money if one donor is persuaded to write a check.</p><p>There is a limit, of course, to what all that money can buy. Some states and markets are more expensive than others. Plus, outside groups are charged more for their ads than campaigns, making the advantage that Democrats have with their super PACs less significant when it comes to what voters actually see.</p><p>For instance, Democrats are spending almost twice as much in the Raleigh-Durham market as Republicans on television. But Republicans actually are set to broadcast a higher number of “Gross Rating Points,” a typical measure of television advertising firepower, in that market. That’s because most of the Democratic spending there is coming from a super PAC, while all the Republican spending there is coming from the Trump campaign. The same is true in other North Carolina markets like Charlotte and Wilmington.</p><p>The total spending figures do not include campaign or super PAC spending on Meta or Google, which owns YouTube. Those digital platforms do not share data publicly on future reservations, but Democrats have outspent Republicans there considerably in the past.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer writes about campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/theodore-schleifer">More about Theodore Schleifer</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
