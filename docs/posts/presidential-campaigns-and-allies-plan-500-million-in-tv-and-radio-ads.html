    <h1>Presidential Campaigns and Allies Plan $500 Million in TV and Radio Ads</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The pro-Trump outside groups have been slower to reserve advertising time, with some buying relatively last-minute ads that can be much more expensive than the reservations made further in advance. The three main pro-Trump outside groups — MAGA Inc., Preserve America PAC and Right for America PAC — have reserved a combined $95 million over that period, less than half the amount reserved by Democratic outside groups.</p><p>Still, the sums reserved by Republicans could change quickly given that several groups are heavily financed by single billionaire donors, such as Miriam Adelson and Timothy Mellon, meaning that a super PAC could quickly secure and spend significant money if one donor is persuaded to write a check.</p><p>There is a limit, of course, to what all that money can buy. Some states and markets are more expensive than others. Plus, outside groups are charged more for their ads than campaigns, making the advantage that Democrats have with their super PACs less significant when it comes to what voters actually see.</p><p>For instance, Democrats are spending almost twice as much in the Raleigh-Durham market as Republicans on television. But Republicans actually are set to broadcast a higher number of “Gross Rating Points,” a typical measure of television advertising firepower, in that market. That’s because most of the Democratic spending there is coming from a super PAC, while all the Republican spending there is coming from the Trump campaign. The same is true in other North Carolina markets like Charlotte and Wilmington.</p><p>The total spending figures do not include campaign or super PAC spending on Meta or Google, which owns YouTube. Those digital platforms do not share data publicly on future reservations, but Democrats have outspent Republicans there considerably in the past.</p></div></div>
