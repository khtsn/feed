The Manhattan district attorney’s office sought to bring him to New York to prosecute him for the death of Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare. In charging documents, prosecutors have characterized the killing as an “act of terrorism” because it was intended, they say, to influence government policies and intimidate civilians.</p><p>After his arrest last week, Mr. Mangione initially indicated through his lawyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-luigi-mangione/heres-the-latest?smid=url-share" title="">that he would contest extradition</a> to New York. Mr. Mangione has been represented by a lawyer in Pennsylvania, but he has also hired a prominent New York defense lawyer who formerly worked as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office.</p><p>Mr. Mangione is expected to face federal charges in addition to the New York State murder indictment brought against him, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. It was not immediately clear what charges Mr. Mangione would face in a federal case, or how those might affect the state case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the courthouse in Hollidaysburg, Pa., on Thursday, Mr. Mangione arrived handcuffed and wearing an orange jail jumpsuit. He gave brief answers to say he understood the proceeding and that he was agreeing to be extradited. He conferred extensively with his Pennsylvania lawyer, Thomas Dickey, and was expressive at the defense table, furrowing and raising his eyebrows, nodding, shrugging his shoulders and at times smiling.</p><p>Mr. Mangione left the courthouse after the hearing in the custody of New York City police officers, who placed him in a black police vehicle. He is expected to be transported to New York to await arraignment, which would most likely take place on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Dickey said that Pennsylvania prosecutors had agreed to turn over a 20-page police report earlier than required in exchange for Mr. Mangione waiving his right to a preliminary hearing on the more minor gun and forgery charges he faces in Pennsylvania.</p><p>The courtroom in Hollidaysburg was packed to the brim with journalists, other observers and roughly a dozen New York Police Department officers, and the jury box was turned into a standing-room-only section. As Mr. Mangione sat at the defense table waiting for his lawyer to return from the judge’s chambers, he flipped through a stack of documents.</p><p>There was also a small group of people standing outside the courthouse with signs supporting Mr. Mangione, including several people wearing the signature green hat worn by a character named Luigi from the Mario video game franchise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Among them was Ashlyn Adami, 27, who said she had driven to Pennsylvania from South Bend, Ind., the night before, and wanted to help call attention to problems in the health insurance industry.</p><p>Ms. Adami said that she, like Mr. Mangione, had struggled with back pain, and that she had to fight her two private health insurers for years before they would approve treatment.</p><p>“Violence is not the answer,” Ms. Adami said, “but it’s why people are listening, and that’s why we’re here, because privatized health care is a crime against humanity, and it is systemic violence.”</p><p>The New York City police have said that Mr. Mangione <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/05/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-shooting-maps-photos.html" title="">waited outside a hotel</a> a short walk from Times Square and shot Mr. Thompson several times early on the morning of Dec. 4, when the executive was on his way to an investor meeting. The brazen killing prompted a five-day manhunt that ended in Altoona, Pa., where Mr. Mangione was captured while eating breakfast in McDonald’s after he was unable to get a room at a nearby motel.</p><p>The authorities said that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Mangione had a gun with him that matched the shell casings left at the crime scene. They also said he had a document with him that decried “parasites” — apparently referring to people working in the health insurance industry — and said that he had acted alone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The targeting of a top health executive has prompted discussion about Americans’ frustrations with the high cost and chronic dysfunction of the country’s health care system, and in particular, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/upshot/us-health-care-expensive-country-comparison.html" title="">practices and profits</a> of health insurance companies.</p><p>In some corners, Mr. Mangione was lauded as something of a hero, a characterization that has been denounced by community leaders and law enforcement officials. Jessica Tisch, the commissioner of the New York Police Department, said she was appalled by the “celebration of coldblooded murder.”</p><p>Other than at court appearances, Mr. Mangione has not spoken publicly since he was arrested, except for a moment last week when he shouted to reporters as he was being taken into a courthouse by sheriff’s deputies. In that outburst, he said something was “completely out of touch, and an insult to the intelligence of the American people” and made a reference to “lived experience.” It was not clear to what he was referring. (The sheriff of Blair County, whose deputies were escorting Mr. Mangione at the time, said Mr. Mangione had told him he was upset with the news media.)</p><p>Mr. Thompson lived in a Minneapolis suburb and had been with UnitedHealthcare for more than 20 years. He became its chief executive in 2021. The company made $16 billion in profits last year, and Mr. Thompson was paid more than $10 million in total compensation.</p><p>United has said that neither Mr. Mangione nor his family had health insurance coverage through the company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Mangione, a computer engineer who grew up in a Baltimore suburb, told friends that he suffered from back pain and underwent surgery for the problem in the summer of 2023. He later reported on Reddit that the operation was a success.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/luigi-mangione-gunman-united-healthcare-shooting.html" title="">Little is known</a> about how Mr. Mangione spent the last six months. He lived in Hawaii for some time before going on a trip to Asia, with stops in Thailand and Japan, according to people who knew him. His friends and family tried to contact him during those months but could not reach him.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Brian Conway<!-- -->, <!-- -->Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hurubie Meko<!-- --> and <!-- -->William K.
