    <h1>Luigi Mangione, CEO Killing Suspect, Faces Hearing Over Extradition to New York</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The police have said that Mr. Mangione <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/05/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-shooting-maps-photos.html" title="">waited outside of a hotel</a> a short walk from Times Square and shot Mr. Thompson multiple times early in the morning on Dec. 4, while the executive was on his way to an investor meeting. The brazen killing prompted a five-day manhunt that ended in Altoona, Pa., where Mr. Mangione was captured in a McDonald’s while he was eating breakfast, after he was unable to get a room at a nearby motel.</p><p>The authorities said that, at the time of his arrest, Mr. Mangione had a gun with him that matched the shell casings left at the crime scene. And they also said he had a document with him that decried “parasites” — apparently referring to those working in the health insurance industry — and said he had acted alone.</p><p>The targeting of a top health executive has prompted discussion about Americans’ frustrations with the high cost and chronic dysfunction of country’s health care system and, in particular, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/upshot/us-health-care-expensive-country-comparison.html" title="">practices and profits</a> of insurance companies. But in some corners, Mr. Mangione was lauded as something of a hero, a characterization that has been denounced by community leaders and law enforcement officials. Jessica Tisch, the commissioner of the New York Police Department, said she was appalled by the “celebration of coldblooded murder.”</p><p>Mr. Mangione, a computer engineer who grew up in a Baltimore suburb, has not spoken publicly since he was arrested, except for a moment last week when he shouted to reporters as he was being taken into a courthouse by the police. In that outburst, he said something was “completely out of touch, and an insult to the intelligence of the American people” and made a reference to “lived experience.” It was not clear to what he was referring. (The sheriff of Blair County, whose deputies were pushing Mr. Mangione into the courthouse at the time, said Mr. Mangione had told him he was upset with the news media.)</p><p>Mr. Thompson lived in a Minneapolis suburb and had been with UnitedHealthcare for more than 20 years. He became its chief executive in 2021. The company made $16 billion in profits last year, and Mr. Thompson was paid more than $10 million in total compensation.</p></div></div>
