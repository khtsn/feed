    <h1>Luigi Mangione, CEO Killing Suspect, Faces Hearing Over Extradition to New York</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The 26-year-old man accused of murdering a health care executive in Manhattan agreed on Thursday to be extradited to New York, where he will face a first-degree murder charge. </p><p>The man, Luigi Mangione, was being held at a prison in Pennsylvania after he was spotted in a McDonald’s in the central part of the state and arrested by the local police. The Manhattan district attorney’s office sought to bring him to New York to prosecute him for the death of Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare. In charging documents, prosecutors have characterized the killing as an “act of terrorism” because it was intended, they say, to influence government policies and intimidate civilians.</p><p>After his arrest last week, Mr. Mangione initially indicated through his lawyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-luigi-mangione/heres-the-latest?smid=url-share" title="">that he would contest extradition</a> to New York. Mr. Mangione has been represented by a lawyer in Pennsylvania, but he has also hired a prominent New York defense lawyer who formerly worked as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office.</p><p>Since he is no longer contesting extradition, Mr. Mangione is expected to be transported to a New York City jail to await arraignment, which would most likely take place on Friday.</p></div></div>
