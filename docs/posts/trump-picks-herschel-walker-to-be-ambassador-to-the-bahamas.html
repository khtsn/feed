    <h1>Trump Picks Herschel Walker to Be Ambassador to the Bahamas</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Walker’s relationship with Mr. Trump stretches back to the early 1980s, when the football star joined the New Jersey Generals, a United States Football League team then owned by Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump wrote in his book “The Art of the Deal” that he would berate the team’s coach for not properly using Mr. Walker’s talents. Nearly 40 years later, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Walker early in the Senate campaign, despite concerns from some Republicans about Mr. Walker’s personal history, clearing a path through the primary for his failed challenge against Mr. Warnock.</p><p>Mr. Walker has no previous diplomatic experience, and no obvious ties to the Bahamas, an island nation of about 400,000 people just off the coast of Florida. That is not unusual for those appointed as ambassadors to smaller or less politically significant assignments, which often go to <a href="https://cr.usembassy.gov/ambassador/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top donors</a>, <a href="https://jp.usembassy.gov/ambassador-rahm-emanuel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">party officials</a>, <a href="https://bb.usembassy.gov/ambassador-roger-f-nyhus-arrives-in-barbados/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">business leaders</a>, <a href="https://bz.usembassy.gov/ambassador-michelle-kwan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">star athletes</a> or other high-profile figures. They are then usually supported in their overseas missions by career diplomats from the State Department.</p><p>The announcement also caps a run of potential appointments for Republicans who lost recent Senate races in Georgia. Former Senator Kelly Loeffler, who was unseated by Mr. Warnock, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/kelly-loeffler-trump-small-business-administration.html" title="">picked to run the Small Business Administration</a>. And former Senator David Perdue, who lost his seat to Senator Jon Ossoff, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/david-perdue-trump-china-ambassador.html" title="">selected to be ambassador to China</a>.</p><p>The United States has not had a permanent ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade, with several nominees stuck in limbo because the Senate never acted on their appointments. Both of Mr. Trump’s nominees for ambassador to the Bahamas in his first term stalled out. President Biden’s pick for the job, Calvin Smyre, was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/13/president-biden-announces-key-nominees-15/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced in May 2022</a>. Two and a half years later, no action <a href="https://www.congress.gov/nomination/118th-congress/30?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22smyre%22%2C%22smyre%22%5D%7D&amp;s=3&amp;r=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been taken on Mr. Smyre’s nomination.</a></p></div></div>
