Trump was inaugurated, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health was preparing to give an invited talk at a scientific meeting when an urgent call came in from an administrative assistant.</p><p>There is a total communications ban, the scientist was told, and you cannot give the speech.</p><p>As soon as the scientist got back to the office, another ban went into effect — one that prohibited researchers from submitting papers to journals for publication.</p><p>Seven senior investigators working in different parts of the National Institutes of Health described rules put in place on orders from the Department of Government Efficiency that risk hampering and undermining American medical science. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared for their jobs for speaking publicly.</p><p>One said that DOGE had begun a reign of “chaos and confusion.” The scientists warned that it had the potential to seriously weaken the N.I.H. — the crown jewel of American science, with a vast network of thousands of researchers in 27 centers dedicated to treating disease, improving health and funding medical research.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Rules change seemingly from day to day.</p><p>Can scientists order necessary supplies to do their research? Yes. No. Maybe.</p><p>Can they travel? A 30-day ban was put in place on Feb. 26. What happens next? No one knows.</p><p>“It really is quite chilling,” one of the scientists said. “They are controlling information, causing chaos, disrupting everyone, keeping us off-balance.”</p><p>“Whatever people are reading in newspapers, it’s 10 times worse,” the scientist added.</p><p>The scientists acknowledge that the N.I.H., like any institution, is not perfect. It has long been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/health/research/28cancer.html" title="">criticized</a> for being too cautious, for example by failing to take a chance on high risk, high reward research proposals.</p><p>“I would be lining up at the front of the line to help with a rational process to help improve this place,” another of the scientists said.</p><p>An N.I.H. spokeswoman said that the agency was complying with an executive order, but that some activities were continuing, including payments for supplies for clinical research studies or ongoing research experiments. And, she added, “travel for the purposes of human safety, human or animal health care, security, biosecurity, biosafety or I.T. security may continue.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The spokeswoman did not address the purpose of changing so many policies and practices. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/nih-hearing-jay-bhattacharya.html" title="">Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who awaits confirmation</a> from the Senate to lead the N.I.H., also did not address these issues at his confirmation hearings this month. But he said in his opening statement that “American biomedical sciences are at a crossroads,” citing <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pew survey data</a> that found almost a quarter of Americans had little or no confidence that scientists were acting in the best interests of the American people.</p><hr/><p>The N.I.H. towers over the world’s medical research.</p><p>It is where the human <a href="https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/geneticcode.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">genetic code</a> was deciphered, where <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2020/press-release/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hepatitis C</a> was discovered, where the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp038194" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AIDS virus</a> was isolated, where the first <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/antiretroviral-drug-development#:~:text=AZT%3A%20The%20First%20Drug%20to%20Treat%20HIV%20Infection&amp;text=Used%20alone%2C%20AZT%20decreased%20deaths,Drug%20Administration%20for%20treating%20AIDS." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drug to treat AIDS</a> was discovered and where basic research that helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/15/health/mrna-vaccine.html" title="">lead to the Covid vaccines</a> was done. It funded the work decades ago that led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/health/weight-loss-drugs-obesity-ozempic-wegovy.html" title="">the creation of Ozempic</a> and other new drugs that cause weight loss.</p><p>“It is very hard to cite seminal discoveries that were not in some way underwritten by the N.I.H.,” said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, a professor of medicine at Columbia University who, like most medical researchers in the United States, has received N.I.H. funding.</p><p>Dr. Francis Collins, a former director of the N.I.H., said, “If you are taking an F.D.A.-approved drug that is improving the quality or length of your life, there is a 99 percent chance N.I.H. was involved in the pathway to its discovery.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Part of the Department of Health and Human Services now led by Robert F.

Many say they are driven by a love of science and a thirst to better humanity through their discoveries.</p><p>Dr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/25/us/politics/monica-bertagnolli-nih.html" title="">Monica Bertagnolli</a>, who stepped down in January as the director of the N.I.H., said scientists there “are so dedicated to the mission.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The agency also supports research by an additional <a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">300,000 scientists at more than 2,500 universities and medical centers</a> — research that is also being threatened.</p><p>Hundreds of highly competitive grants that support research at universities and medical schools across the country have been cut. Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/columbia-research-grants-trump.html" title="">people who have diabetes</a> or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century. (Those funds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html" title="">may be restored</a>, though, as Columbia agreed last week to a list of demands from the Trump administration.)</p><p>A <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-251.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a> that supported training scientists from minority groups, those who had disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds has also disappeared.</p><p>And research grants that helped pay to train doctoral and postdoctoral students have been slashed. Now universities are rescinding offers to young scientists.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Senior scientists within the N.I.H. say their work faces daily disruptions.</p><p>Some disruptions are petty: Every N.I.H. employee, no matter how senior, has to send a weekly email to a human resources address with five bullet points stating what was accomplished in the past week. The employees never hear anything back, one senior scientist who has been at the N.I.H. for decades said. But the scientist said that he and other scientists feel a high degree of paranoia about the messages.</p><p>Other consequences are more serious: A senior scientist who studies a rare and devastating disorder that affects young children and who is studying a treatment that might help had been invited to consult with doctors caring for such children. At the last minute, he was told he could not go.</p><p>“That is completely unacceptable,” that scientist said.</p><p>Researchers have also struggled to purchase basic and specialized supplies needed to conduct their work.</p><p>One of the senior scientists said that when DOGE recently put a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/09/doge-government-credit-card-limits/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1 spending limit</a> on government credit cards, it was apparently with no knowledge of how essential the cards were to basic operations. There was no mechanism, for example, to pay for gas for vehicles used to transport patients’ blood samples.</p><p>“We had to scramble and beg” to get funds, the scientist said. A few days ago, nonemergency supply orders resumed. But, the scientist said, “now there is a huge backlog.” And the staff that handled orders has been decimated by firings, he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“We’ve been told you’d better think weeks ahead about supplies and reagents,” he said.</p><p>Other scientists said they had been affected by inconsistent guidelines on purchasing.</p><p>“They keep changing the rules,” said the senior scientist who has spent decades at the N.I.H. “Policies change so quickly and frequently that who knows.”</p><p>A different N.I.H. senior scientist said a program he used to order supplies for his lab was closed for a month. Then it opened for a day or so. “A few days later it shut down again,” he said. And it has stayed shut.</p><p>He needs mice with special genetic traits for his studies.</p><p>“We can’t order mice,” he said. As a result, he said, several years’ worth of work is in jeopardy.</p><p>Scientists were chilled by the disruptive firing and rehiring of employees.</p><p>The Friday before Presidents’ Day weekend in February, a senior physician scientist learned that about 20 technicians had been fired in an N.I.H. blood bank where patient samples are analyzed, part of an order that eliminated probationary workers who had been in their current position for less than two years. The order also led to the firing of probationary workers who prepare transfusions there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Also on the list to be fired because they were probationary were the fellows who care for sick patients in the Clinical Center — the N.I.H.’s hospital devoted to clinical research on its Bethesda campus. They included the staff of the intensive care unit and members of the code blue team that responds when a patient has a cardiac arrest.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Probationary employees, including medical fellows and lab technicians, were fired at the N.I.H. and later reinstated.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Supervisors were stunned. These patients were ill. Who is going to care for them?</p><p>“We would literally have to airlift patients out,” the senior physician scientist said.</p><p>The Clinical Center got a last-minute reprieve after the researchers panicked and protested. DOGE stopped the firing of the intensive care doctors and allowed the N.I.H. to rehire the fired laboratory technicians and blood bank workers.</p><p>“It was just unbelievably stressful,” the senior physician scientist said.</p><p>Other scientists are learning that no job is safe, even ones held by highly regarded people with seniority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Tenured staff members at the N.I.H. can no longer take for granted the automatic renewal of their contracts, a senior scientist said. Now some scientists are being put on leave without pay when their contracts run out, and then they wait anxiously to learn if they still have a job.</p><p>The effects ripple beyond the N.I.H., affecting decisions about what sort of research projects by academic scientists can even be considered for funding.</p><p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes, on the N.I.H.’s Bethesda campus, had been planning to issue grants to academic scientists to study blood- and brain-scan markers of non-Alzheimer’s dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The project’s goal was to diagnose patients earlier and to see whether experimental drugs were helping.</p><p>But evaluating these grant proposals requires specialized review at the neurological disorders institute. DOGE’s orders shifted the reviews to another office where reviewers would not have specific expertise.</p><p>The result, a senior scientist administrator said, is that “we will not be able to run that kind of program.” Instead, he said, “we will have to do simpler things.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>N.I.H. employees are anxious that they will soon face a mass firing or reduction in force.</p><p>No one seems to know who would be fired, what criteria would be used or when it would happen, said the senior scientist who spoke about the problem ordering supplies.</p><p>“It’s the not knowing, the chaos” that is torturing people, he said.</p><p>“If they said, ‘We are going to RIF administrative senior scientists or anyone over 65 or anyone whose rating was poor,’ it would be much less stressful,” he said, using the acronym for reduction in force.</p><p>“But this is like Russian roulette,” he added. “You don’t know what’s coming.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Gina Kolata reports on diseases and treatments, how treatments are discovered and tested, and how they affect people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata">More about Gina Kolata</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>13</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>‘Chaos and Confusion’ at American Science Pillar<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-institutes-of-health">National Institutes of Health</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/health/nih-doge-trump.html">163</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/health/nih-doge-trump.html">163</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Musk Effect:</strong> Elon Musk is seemingly everywhere, dominating the news out of Washington and beyond.
