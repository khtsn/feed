Military drones hold the potential to erode Taiwan’s defenses against possible incursions or an attack by China, which claims the island as its territory. Taiwan plans to expand its military drone numbers to blunt that risk.</p><p>Taiwanese officials hope that their island can become a bigger player in the supply chain for drones for the United States and allied countries, echoing Taiwan’s success in producing advanced semiconductors. U.S. officials hope to reduce <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/us/politics/us-china-drones-dji.html" title="">American reliance</a> on Chinese-made drones and components by tapping Taiwan’s manufacturing strengths. Both sides are drawing on <a href="https://www.cnas.org/press/press-release/new-cnas-report-assesses-the-role-of-drones-in-a-future-fight-to-defend-taiwan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lessons</a> from the battlefields of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/30/technology/ukraine-russia-war-drones-china.html" title="">Ukraine</a> and other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/world/asia/myanmar-war-drones.html" title="">war zones</a>, where drones have become important for mounting attacks and monitoring enemy forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“They have certain capabilities, and they’re coming to find out about our capabilities,” Taiwan’s minister of defense, Wellington Koo, told reporters in Taipei last week, referring to the U.S. drone delegation. “We can become part of the international supply chain.”</p><p>The U.S. delegation included representatives from Northrop Grumman, a big military equipment supplier, as well as companies offering undersea drones, drone detection equipment and other innovations in unmanned aerial vehicles, or U.A.V.s. U.S. defense officials accompanied the delegation, according to Taiwanese news reports.</p><p>“Industrial cooperation between the United States and Taiwan is critical to developing supply chain security for a whole range of technologies,” the press office of the American Institute in Taiwan — Washington’s de facto embassy in Taipei — said in a statement.</p><p>But hurdles could slow, even stymie, some of Taiwan’s ambitions for a bigger role in designing and manufacturing drones with the United States and its allies. The United States produces most of its military drones, through defense contractors.</p><p>Without more government support, Taiwan’s small manufacturers may find it difficult to draw enough funding to increase production, and they must navigate stringent security checks for supplying parts for U.S. military drones, said <a href="https://www.ly.gov.tw/EngPages/List.aspx?nodeid=55284" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chen Kuan-ting</a>, a Taiwanese lawmaker from Chiayi, an area that is building production and testing sites for airborne technology.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>U.S. policymakers may be leery of depending too much on Taiwan for drone parts. Some worry about industrial secrets leaking to China. If Taiwan were to come under a Chinese blockade or attack, American drone makers could lose flows of vital components.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The State Department has given AeroVironment, an American defense contractor, the green light to sell up to 720 Switchblade drones to Taiwan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ann Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Security and intellectual property risks are real but manageable with the right safeguards,” said <a href="https://www.fdd.org/team/craig-singleton/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Craig Singleton</a>, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a research institute in Washington. “Cooperation with Taiwan is crucial, but it needs to be part of a broader strategy that includes shifting some production to more secure locations. This way, the U.S. can benefit from Taiwan’s capabilities without overexposing itself to geopolitical risks.”</p><p>Still, the shared worries about China’s military technology are likely to keep driving U.S. and Taiwanese companies toward more collaboration. “Deepening defense industry cooperation between us can send the right message to the Chinese Communist Party: don’t rashly launch a war against Taiwan,” Hsu Yen-pu, a Taiwanese vice minister for defense, told a U.S.-Taiwan defense industry conference in Philadelphia on Monday, according to a transcript shared by the Taiwanese defense ministry.</p><p>China’s military drones have become an increasingly common sight in the skies near Taiwan, and they have made <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2024/08/05/2003821799" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flights circling Taiwan’s main island</a>, according to Taiwan’s ministry of defense. China dominates commercial drone sales in the United States and across much of the world, led by DJI, which says it holds <a href="https://dronedj.com/2024/08/13/dji-china-drone-success-secret/#:~:text=Founded%20in%20a%20college%20dorm,to%20surpass%20its%20market%20leadership." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of the global market. Despite Taiwan’s icy political relations with China, DJI drones are similarly popular with Taiwanese consumers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“DJI drones — I think it’s best to think about them as Huawei with wings,” Mr. Singleton said in a recent presentation, likening DJI to China’s giant telecommunications company. “Through brute-force economics, the Chinese have established a Chinese champion that controls our current market.”</p><p>China’s market dominance makes it harder for Taiwanese drone companies to grow big enough to remain robust during slack times for military orders. Access to more American orders, both commercial and defense, could help overcome that.</p><p>“We understand the importance of supporting Taiwan’s own U.A.V. industry, and we believe partnerships can be structured in a way that benefits both sides,” René Carbone Bardorf, the vice president for marketing and communications at AeroVironment, a company on the trade mission, said in a statement. In June, the State Department <a href="https://www.dsca.mil/press-media/major-arms-sales/taipei-economic-and-cultural-representative-office-united-states-33" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gave the green light</a> for AeroVironment to sell up to 720 Switchblade drones to Taiwan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration of Thunder Tiger drones in Chiayi, Taiwan, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ann Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Taiwan’s ministry of defense <a href="https://www.mnd.gov.tw/newupload/ndr/112/112ndreng.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last year</a> that it will acquire 7,700 drones in coming years. But turning to Taiwan for more and more parts could raise costs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“To all of a sudden have these manufacturers move back to producing in Taiwan, we’ll have to see if there’s the determination to remove Chinese parts suppliers from the drone industry,” said Chen Kwan-ju, the chairman of Thunder Tiger, a Taiwanese firm that took part in the talks. “I think this really all comes down to the government’s attitude.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-buckley">More about Chris Buckley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
