    <h1>Laken Riley Murder Trial: Jose Ibarra Found Guilty of Killing Georgia Nursing Student</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Ibarra was apprehended by Border Patrol agents when he entered the country illegally in 2022 near El Paso, according to federal officials. Like many migrants, he was released with temporary permission to stay in the country, and he headed at first to New York. Mr. Ibarra moved to Athens last year because his brother lived there, according to testimony during the trial, and had told him there were plenty of jobs.</p><p>But during the trial, prosecutors largely skirted issues related to Mr. Ibarra’s immigration status. Instead, they zeroed in on Feb. 22, portraying him as a predator who was out that morning hunting for women and Ms. Riley as a victim who happened to cross his path.</p><p>Prosecutors described a harrowing struggle as Ms. Riley tried to fend off her attacker, sinking her fingernails into his arms and neck, leaving deep scratches. Then, prosecutors said that Mr. Ibarra dragged her off the running trail, where he strangled her and hit her over the head with a rock — using it “like it was a hammer,” Sheila Ross, the special prosecutor leading the case, said in her closing arguments.</p><p>A number of local and federal law enforcement witnesses provided detailed accounts that placed Mr. Ibarra at the scene of Ms. Riley’s killing, mainly through cellphone data and GPS tracking data from Ms. Riley’s smart watch.</p><p>Mr. Ibarra’s lawyers argued that the evidence against him was circumstantial and inconclusive, and that his brother, Diego Ibarra, with whom he shared an apartment in Athens, could have been the culprit.</p></div></div>
