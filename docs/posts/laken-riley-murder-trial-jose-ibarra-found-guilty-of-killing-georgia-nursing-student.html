Trump in his push for the mass deportation of millions of undocumented people.</p><p>Ms. Riley, 22, was attacked in February while running on a trail on the University of Georgia campus in Athens. A day later, the authorities charged Jose Antonio Ibarra, a migrant who had entered the country illegally, in connection with the killing.</p><p>Judge H. Patrick Haggard of State Superior Court in Athens-Clarke County found Mr. Ibarra guilty after a bench trial that included four days of arguments and testimony. The judge, rather than a jury, decided the case at the request of Mr. Ibarra’s lawyers after they tried unsuccessfully to move the case out of Athens and to keep certain evidence from being presented to jurors. </p><p>On Wednesday, lawyers for Mr. Ibarra said that their decision was based on concerns that a jury in Athens could not review the evidence dispassionately.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Haggard announced his verdict minutes after lawyers concluded their arguments on Wednesday morning and planned to sentence Mr. Ibarra in the early afternoon. Prosecutors are seeking a maximum penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p>For months, Ms. Riley’s name had been invoked by conservatives, who argued that her death had been the result of a failure by the Biden administration to secure the nation’s borders. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump called Mr. Ibarra a “monster.” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, heckled President Biden about the case during his State of the Union address, goading him into addressing it.</p><p>Mr. Ibarra was apprehended by Border Patrol agents when he entered the country in 2022 near El Paso, according to federal officials. Like many migrants, he was released with temporary permission to stay in the country, and he headed at first to New York. Mr. Ibarra moved to Athens last year because his brother lived there, according to testimony during the trial, and had told him there were plenty of jobs.</p><p>During the trial, prosecutors largely skirted issues related to Mr. Ibarra’s immigration status. Instead, they zeroed in on Feb. 22, portraying him as a predator who was out that morning hunting for women and Ms. Riley as a victim who happened to cross his path.</p><p>Prosecutors described a harrowing struggle as Ms. Riley tried to fend off her attacker, sinking her fingernails into his arms and neck, leaving deep scratches. Then, prosecutors said that Mr. Ibarra dragged her off the running trail, where he strangled her and hit her over the head with a rock — using it “like it was a hammer,” Sheila Ross, the special prosecutor leading the case, said in her closing arguments.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The evidence in this case,” she added, “has spoken loud and clear that he is Laken Riley’s killer.”</p><p>Mr. Ibarra’s lawyers argued that the evidence against him was circumstantial and inconclusive, and that his brother, Diego Ibarra, with whom he shared an apartment in Athens, could have been the culprit. His lawyers contended that Diego Ibarra was taller and more athletic than his brother.</p><p>“Jose was short, he was chubby,” Kaitlyn Beck, one of the defense lawyers, said in her closing arguments. </p><p>“She was fast, she could have outrun him,” Ms. Beck added, referring to Ms. Riley. “But there’s another suspect in this case who is taller, who is more physically fit.” </p><p>Prosecutors relied on technology, including cellphone data and tracking data from a running watch, to provide a detailed accounting of the attack and the frantic search as Ms. Riley’s roommates and the authorities tried to find her that morning. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Riley had set out for a run shortly after 9 a.m., listening to music and running at a fast clip. But about 10 minutes later, she activated the emergency function on her iPhone, calling 911. The line was silent for nearly a minute before a man could be heard saying “Yo tengo,” or “I have” in Spanish, according to a recording enhanced by investigators. </p><p>By 9:28 a.m., her smartwatch no longer detected Ms. Riley’s heartbeat. </p><p>She and her roommates shared their phone locations with each other, and they used that information to try to find her. </p><p>Her body was found about 12:30 p.m. by a campus police officer. She had been dragged about 65 feet from the trail, where she had been covered with leaves.</p><p>Investigators connected Mr. Ibarra to the attack through a thumbprint that was found on Ms. Riley’s phone screen and a doorbell camera at an apartment complex near the scene that recorded a man who looked like Mr. Ibarra tossing a jacket in a dumpster. The jacket had long, dark hair and blood stains on it. </p><p>In court on Wednesday afternoon, relatives and friends of Ms. Riley detailed their anguish as they encouraged Judge Haggard to give Mr. Ibarra the maximum sentence. They described an excruciating absence in their lives and the fear they still experience.</p><p>“I cannot walk around my own college campus because I’m terrified of people like Jose Ibarra,” said her sister, Lauren Phillips. She added, “That predator is inhumane and the epitome of evil.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rick Rojas is the Atlanta bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the South.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rick-rojas">More about Rick Rojas</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
