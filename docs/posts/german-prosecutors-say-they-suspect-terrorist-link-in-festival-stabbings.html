The man, wearing bloodstained clothes, approached a police car and gave himself up after 11 p.m. Saturday, the police said.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/world/europe/solingen-germany-knife-attack.html" title="">attack on Friday night</a>, the assailant aimed for his victims’ necks to inflict as much damage as possible, the police said.</p><p>Besides planning to bring murder and attempted murder charges in the case against the man, the federal prosecutor is looking into whether he was a member of a foreign terrorist organization, Ines Peterson, a spokeswoman for the office, said on Sunday in an emailed statement.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Islamic State extremist group praised the attacker as a “soldier of the Islamic state,” but it was unclear whether the group had any connection to this particular attack.</p><p>The far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has campaigned largely on an anti-foreigner platform and is poised to make significant gains in three state elections next month, jumped on the news. Even before the identity of the attacker was confirmed by the police, one of its leaders called for changes to <a href="https://x.com/Tino_Chrupalla/status/1827245563395379374" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“migration and security policy.”</a></p><p>The authorities had earlier arrested two people who were later determined unlikely to have been the actual attackers, Herbert Reul, the state interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Solingen is, said in an interview on Saturday with a German broadcaster, ARD.</p><p>A 15-year-old boy, who was arrested early Saturday, is being investigated for not having alerted the police when he learned about imminent plans to attack, prosecutors said. A man arrested by a heavily armed police unit on Saturday evening in the refugee housing facility where the main suspect also lived is being treated as a witness, the police and Mr. Reul said.</p><p>On Saturday, Solingen’s mayor, the state governor and other political leaders gathered on a downtown square several hundred yards from where the attack took place to mourn the victims. It was an eerie repeat of a similar impromptu service held in Mannheim, another town in western Germany, where only three months ago <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/world/europe/activist-officer-stabbing-germany.html" title="">an Afghan refugee attacked an anti-immigrant rally</a> with a knife and killed a police officer trying to intervene.</p></div></div><div><p>On Sunday, which was supposed to be the final day of a festival celebrating a city best known for making knives and scissors, a group of mourners met at a service held in a church next to the site of the attack.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
