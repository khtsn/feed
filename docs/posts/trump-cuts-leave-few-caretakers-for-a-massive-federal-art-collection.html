But where collection management staff at museums typically track, catalog and maintain art held in their main building and a handful of storage spaces, the government collection has been placed in federal offices and private institutions in all 50 states, plus Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p><p>“We oversaw this collection with about 30 people — a skeleton crew compared to those institutions,” Nick Hartigan, a former fine arts specialist with the G.S.A. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-hartigan-83b8008b_until-last-week-i-had-the-privilege-of-serving-activity-7304966671088140288-uuTa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote recently</a> on social media. Like most of the staff, he was let go in March, but remains on paid administrative leave while a court reviews his and other terminations.</p><p>A second issue is that many of the artworks are in some of the dozens of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/federal-properties-sale-list-trump.html" title="">federal properties</a> that have been identified by the Trump Administration for possible sale.</p><p>The Wilbur J. Cohen federal building in downtown Washington D.C., for example, is one of those up for disposition. It is <a href="https://art.gsa.gov/locations/890189/wilbur-j-cohen-federal-building/objects" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">adorned with large artworks</a> that would be difficult, if not impossible, to move. A wall-sized mural by Philip Guston hangs in the auditorium. The lobby is <a href="https://livingnewdeal.org/sites/wilbur-j-cohen-building-shahn-frescoes-washington-dc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ornately frescoed</a>.

It is now unclear who would do that job.</p><p>“I am particularly worried about the artwork’s maintenance and upkeep and figuring out where things are,” said Charlotte Cohen, a former fine arts officer in the New York and Caribbean region for the G.S.A. “It’s the legacy of the people of the United States.”</p><p>Inventory management of the collection may grow only more complicated under a plan proposed by the businessman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/arts/music/trump-kennedy-center-zampolli.html" title="">Paolo Zampolli</a>, a Kennedy Center board member whom President Trump appointed “special envoy for global partnerships” in a March <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114145975409380484" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth Social post</a>. Mr. Zampolli proposes loaning federally-owned art to museums in other countries as a way to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the United States.</p><p>“We want to see our American values in other countries,” Mr. Zampolli said in an interview. “Not only sending Boeings, but our music, our art, and our sports.”</p><p>He dismissed concerns about risks to the collection, attributing them to bitter staffers.</p><p>“I think this is fake news,” Mr. Zampolli said, “a disgruntled let-go bureaucrat or government official or whatever you want to call it, because they never organize anything similar.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The exact parameters of the staff layoffs are imprecise because the agency has refused to specify the number, calling the issue a personnel matter. A spokesman for the G.S.A. also did not address how the collection would be managed with a depleted staff, except to say that the agency “remains committed to effective resource utilization as we continue to maintain our art collection and ensure these historical artifacts remain documented, protected, and available for display in our governmental facilities.”</p><p>The <a href="https://art.gsa.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">artworks in the G.S.A.’s custody</a> date as far back as the 1850s. Some were commissioned to support artists during the Depression, a practice that has continued for new federal buildings constructed today.</p><p>The collection includes about 23,000 artworks that are on renewable five-year loans to cultural institutions — ranging from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the <a href="https://www.illinoisstatemuseum.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Illinois State Museum</a>. Another 1,500 are in federal buildings, with an additional 1,500 in storage.</p><p>The G.S.A. has been shepherding much of the nation’s art work since its inception in 1949. Other agencies manage their own collections, including the Architect of the Capitol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alexander Calder, “Flamingo,” 1974, at the John C.

The first piece was unveiled in 1974: Calder’s “<a href="https://art.gsa.gov/artworks/23671/flamingo?ctx=d81151aef11bc7b17e298985e708ab87844643fb&amp;idx=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flamingo</a>” at the Federal Center in Chicago. Since then, G.S.A. has commissioned more than 500 artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 1978, for example, the fiber artist Lenore Tawney created a cascade of light blue strings entitled “<a href="https://art.gsa.gov/artworks/21154/cloud-series-iv?ctx=9abfe7e7bd682db9cc4a722593a6fd71e08b61d5&amp;idx=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cloud Series IV</a>” for the John F. Shea federal courthouse in Santa Rosa, Calif. The building is now on the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/real-estate/real-estate-services/real-property-disposition/assets-identified-for-accelerated-disposition" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list to be sold</a>.</p><p>Part of the job of G.S.A.’s Fine Arts unit — which once had staff in each of <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/gsa-regions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11 regional offices</a> — is to ensure there are regular checkups for peeling paint, corroding marble and water damage. The handful of specialists left will still be responsible for commissioning new art, arranging restoration efforts, and the relocation and cataloging of objects.</p><p>“It’s prosaic work,” Cohen said, “like making sure they are cleaning a <a href="http://browse.americanartcollaborative.org/object/saam/1979.159.44.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sol LeWitt sculpture at a courthouse in Syracuse</a> with the right water pressure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Cloud Series IV” by Lenore Tawney is in a federal building that is on a list of properties that the Trump Administration is considering for sale. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Blake Marvin</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The collection includes artworks commissioned for public buildings built after the Civil War and during the 1930s as part of New Deal programs to help unemployed artists. Reginald Marsh’s <a href="https://art.gsa.gov/artworks/17656/scenes-of-new-york-harbor?ctx=a289177b2a12194fd616020d45844045bce989e0&amp;idx=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">murals of the New York City harbor</a> grace the rotunda of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, for example, and James Lee Hansen’s <a href="https://art.gsa.gov/artworks/500/young-lincoln?ctx=2a90d71142d271840eedf8b5b5fae65f4ba9c3b0&amp;idx=19" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Young Lincoln</a> stands at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. </p><p>Peer review committees evaluate artists for each commission.

She has served as a peer reviewer for the program. “What happens to the art? What happens to the archive? What happens to the whole history?”</p><p>Pieces of the portfolio are never sold; if a building containing art, such as a mural, changes hands or is demolished, the work is either transferred to another building, returned to the G.S.A. or covered by a covenant that commits the new owner to continued upkeep. The works are rarely appraised, so there is no official estimate of the collection’s value. And the art is not insured, so the government has little financial recourse if items are lost or damaged.</p><p>“Without sufficient staffing, the risk of losing track of artworks or failing to properly preserve them is a real threat,” Trébault of Artists at Risk Connection said.</p><p>Artworks have gone missing before, including a 1936 painting “Gulls at Monhegan,” by Andrew Winter. It had <a href="https://www.gsaig.gov/sites/default/files/misc-reports/NewDealArtwork_JPI_Spring2011.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been assigned</a> to the U.S. embassy in Costa Rica, but was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/04/16/303718738/new-deal-treasure-government-searches-for-long-lost-art" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mistakenly given</a> to a retiring ambassador and then passed down through his family, according to the G.S.A. The agency <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfOOhPE166k" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recovered</a> the artwork after it turned up at an auction house in Portland, Maine in 2001.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paulo Zampolli, a special enjoy appointed by President Trump, at the G.S.A. warehouse in Virginia.

Mr. Zampolli came along and met with officials from the Ministry of Culture, whom he said were eager to host American art works as a means of cultural exchange.</p><p>A few days later, Mr. Zampolli visited the G.S.A.’s warehouse in Alexandria, Virginia, where it stores the 1,500 works that are not on display.</p><p>“The ART IS SAFE!” he posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ_vEnQuhUu/?igsh=MXNmNHE0NmF0ZTVn&amp;img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Instagram</a>, along with pictures of himself holding some of the works stored there. “THE USA GOLDEN ART reserve is ready for this new era.”</p><p>Mr. Zampolli said that he did not think what he was proposing increased the collection’s vulnerability, but he acknowledged that he was not aware that most of the collection is already on loan to museums and other institutions across the U.S.</p><p>“I’m learning,” Mr. Zampolli said. He’s now trying to create a master catalog of all federally-owned art across several agencies, in service of allowing it to travel the world. “I made a couple calls, and everybody’s very excited, they all want to work with me on that.”</p><p><em>Susan Beachy and Will Houp contributed research.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lydia DePillis reports on the American economy.
