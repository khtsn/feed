The country’s hard-hit south has been the focal point of the war.</p><p>The Israeli military “does not intend to target you and therefore you are prohibited at this stage from returning to your homes,” said Avichay Adraee, a military spokesman, in a <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1862363097601826888" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> posted online directed at residents of the towns. “Anyone who moves south of this line puts himself in danger.”</p><p>It is not clear when hundreds of thousands of displaced Lebanese will be able to return to their homes in the south. Under the cease-fire agreement that took effect on Wednesday, Israeli forces will gradually withdraw from southern Lebanon over 60 days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In his first address since the truce, Naim Qassem, Hezbollah’s leader, argued that the war with Israel, lasting almost 14 months, had been a victory for the Iran-backed militia — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-ceasefire.html" title="">difficult proposition</a> given the blows Hezbollah sustained, including the assassination of its previous chief, Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p>“We are looking at a great victory,” Mr. Qassem said in a televised speech from an undisclosed location. “We are victorious because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah, and because we prevented him from quashing the resistance or critically weakening it.”</p><p>But his statements were unlikely persuade many Lebanese. In exchange for the truce, Hezbollah gave up on its original goal in the war, to force Israel to end its campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. And in addition to Hezbollah’s own losses, the Israeli campaign against it demolished entire communities.</p><p>Adding to jitters over the fate of the truce, the Israeli military said on Friday that it had carried out another airstrike in southern Lebanon, targeting what it said was a mobile rocket platform belonging to Hezbollah. A day earlier, the military said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/middleeast/lebanon-israel-ceasefire-hezbollah.html" title="">struck a rocket storage facility</a> in the country’s south.</p><p>Lebanon’s state-run news agency reported on Friday that the Israeli military was enforcing restrictions on returning to towns in the border area with gunfire and shelling. It said Israeli tanks had shelled a building in the town of <a href="https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/742874/israeli-merkava-tank-bombards-home-near-burj-al-mo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Burj al-Moulouk</a> in southern Lebanon, and were also seen moving into the town of <a href="https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/justice-law/742854/four-israeli-tanks-enter-western-district-of-khiya" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khiam</a>, where earlier in the week the news agency said two journalists were injured by Israeli fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Israeli military declined to comment on those reports. Photos of tanks near Khiam, which were verified by The Times, circulated on social media on Friday.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ALJADEEDNEWS/status/1862455579677020213" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> aired by Lebanese broadcasters on Friday, a man on a dirt road in Khiam says he and others with him have received “permission” from U.N. peacekeeping forces and the Lebanese military.</p><p>Seconds later there are several bursts of gunfire. “They shot at us,” the man says as he runs for cover. It was not clear if there were any injuries. The Times verified the video and determined that it was taken next to Khiam’s cemetery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli military vehicles on Friday near Metula, an Israeli town on the border with Lebanon. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Lebanese military has also warned civilians about returning to southern border towns, and a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon said it did not have authority to grant permission to be in that area. It was the latest indication that the cease-fire agreement and military directives have led to confusion among Lebanese about where they can and cannot go.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Israeli military also released a <a href="https://x.com/idfonline/status/1862402378034507922" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more general warning</a> to residents of border towns in Israel, which had been the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-displaced.html" title="">target of Hezbollah</a> rocket and drone attacks for months, telling them the area, evacuated by tens of thousands of residents, remained under a “general closure.” It warned that it could have to intercept aerial munitions, and so the risk of shrapnel falling into evacuated towns could not be ruled out.</p><p>One of the Lebanese towns that Israel labeled as off-limits on Friday was Ain Ebel, a Christian village near the border. Rakan Ashkar Diab, a father of two, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-invasion-christian-village.html" title="">fled</a> the town for Beirut in October but decided to return on Friday despite the warnings.</p><p>He passed destroyed houses along the way, he said, but arrived to find his own home still standing. He said he would not bring his family back yet because of the Israeli warnings, but he hoped to have them home in time for Christmas.</p><p>“We are waiting to see how the situation unfolds,” said Mr. Diab. “It’s still a bit fragile, the cease-fire.”</p><p>Israel stepped up its airstrikes in Lebanon in September and then launched a ground invasion, after almost a year of near-daily Hezbollah rocket fire into northern Israel, which Hezbollah said was an act of solidarity with Hamas, its ally in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The result has been devastating for both Lebanon and Hezbollah, a militant group that is the country’s most powerful political player and military force. It has been the deadliest conflict in Lebanon since the country’s 15-year civil war ended in 1990, and has forced roughly a quarter of the population from their homes. The fighting has killed about 3,800 Lebanese and 100 Israelis, according to their governments.</p><p>Under the cease-fire agreement that went into effect at 4 a.m. on Wednesday, both sides will observe a 60-day truce while Israel gradually withdraws and Hezbollah moves its fighters north of the Litani River, which runs somewhat parallel with the border with Israel.</p><p>That will create a sort of buffer zone to be policed by a U.N. peacekeeping force and Lebanon’s military, neither of which have been combatants in the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sweeping up debris left by Israeli airstrikes in the city of Tyre in southern Lebanon on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But the agreement does not say when civilians will be permitted to return to their homes. On Wednesday, tens of thousands in Lebanon began to go back to ruined communities in the Dahiya area outside Beirut and in the country’s south and east.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/middleeast/un-resolution-1701-explained.html" title="">similar cease-fire</a> deal that ended a war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 was never fully enforced.</p><p>Ori Gordin, the commanding officer of the Israeli military’s northern command, told Israeli troops in southern Lebanon that it was now their job to “enable and enforce” the cease-fire.</p><p>“We will enforce it aggressively,” said Mr. Gordin, in a video of the remarks released on Friday by the military. “We do not intend to let Hezbollah return to these areas.”</p><p>At the same time, the war between Israel and Hamas continues. A gunman attacked an Israeli bus near a settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday. Hamas identified the attacker as a member of its military wing and said he had been killed.</p><p>The attack wounded several people, three of them seriously, according to Israel’s emergency service. The Israeli military said four of its soldiers were lightly wounded, and that it had “neutralized” the shooter.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- -->, <!-- -->Malachy Browne<!-- --> and <!-- -->Dayana Iwaza<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
