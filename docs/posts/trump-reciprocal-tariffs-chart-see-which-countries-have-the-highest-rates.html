    <h1>Trump Reciprocal Tariffs Chart: See Which Countries Have the Highest Rates</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on Wednesday afternoon, announcing a minimum 10 percent tariff on all trading partners as well as so-called reciprocal actions on dozens of other countries, including some of America’s biggest trading partners.</p><p>In announcing the new tariffs, his most expansive to date, Mr. Trump said that the global tariffs would help correct decades of unfair relationships and stop other countries from ripping off the United States.</p><p>China, for example, will see its tariff rate rise to 34 percent, which includes a previous blanket import tax imposed on the country’s goods earlier this year. Vietnam’s imports will be taxed at nearly 50 percent.</p><p>“If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” Mr. Trump said outside the White House on Wednesday, “then you build your product right here in America.”</p></div></div>
