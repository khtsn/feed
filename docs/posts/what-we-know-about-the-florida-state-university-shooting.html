He was taken to the hospital and identified as a student and the son of a local sheriff’s deputy.</p><p>The Tallahassee Police Department, which is leading the investigation, said Friday that all of the injured victims, as well as the suspect, were expected to survive. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida directed flags to be flown at half-staff through Monday.</p><p>Here is what we know.</p><h2 id="link-4a2651b0">The shooting happened near the student union building.</h2><p>At around 11:50 a.m., gunfire erupted near the student union building at Florida State, a public university with an enrollment of more than 43,000, eight days before the last day of classes for the spring semester. The gunman used a handgun, law enforcement officials said at a news conference on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Officers from the university’s Police Department responded. When the gunman did not comply with their commands, they shot and wounded him. He was taken into custody and to the hospital, where he invoked his right to remain silent, Chief Revell said.</p><p>The chief said the suspect was also armed with a shotgun but added that it was unclear whether he had used it in the attack. The police believe that he acted alone.</p><p>Once the shooting began, an emergency alert told the university community to shelter in place, an order that was not lifted until 3:20 p.m. Some terrified students huddled in the student union basement, crying and using their cellphones to let loved ones know what was happening. Police officers cleared classrooms using a safe word, “Seminole,” to identify themselves as the authorities.</p><p>The university canceled classes and business operations for Friday, and student athletics through the weekend.</p><h2 id="link-54138453">Two people were killed, and six others were injured.</h2><p>Law enforcement officials did not identify the two people who were killed, other than to say that they were not students. Aramark, a global food and facilities services company, confirmed in a statement that one of its employees had died in the shooting, but did not name the employee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At least some of the six people who were injured were students. Richard McCullough, the university president, said he had visited some of them at the hospital, Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.</p><h2 id="link-548b6a44">The suspect is the son of a sheriff’s deputy.</h2><p>Sheriff Walter McNeil of Leon County identified the gunman as Phoenix Ikner, 20, and said that his mother was a sheriff’s deputy. The handgun was his mother’s former service weapon, which she had bought for personal use, Sheriff McNeil said. It’s not unusual for deputies to be allowed to purchase their former service weapons, officials said.</p><p>The sheriff’s office website listed someone who appeared to be the mother as a school resource officer at a Tallahassee middle school. Sheriff McNeil said she had been with the office for more than 18 years and called her service “exceptional.”</p><p>The sheriff said the suspect was a “longstanding member” of the department’s youth advisory council, which engages young people and seeks their input, and had taken part in a number of training programs.</p><p>“So he has been steeped in the Leon County sheriff’s family,” the sheriff said, calling Thursday’s shooting “tragic.” He vowed to do everything possible to prosecute the suspect and “make sure that we send a message to folks that this will never be tolerated here in Leon County.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-1febf773">The suspect’s childhood was tumultuous.</h2><p>Court records show that the suspect’s biological mother, who is not the local sheriff’s deputy, was accused of taking him to Norway in violation of a custody agreement in 2015, when he was 10 years old. The court documents listed the suspect’s name as Christian Gunnar Eriksen, which was changed to Phoenix Ikner 2020, and said that he and his biological mother were dual American Norwegian citizens.</p><p>The biological mother had some custody rights but could not take her son out of the country without prior notification. At the time, she said she was going to travel with him to South Florida for spring break but instead took him to Norway, according to an affidavit.</p><p>The affidavit also said that Christian had “developmental delays and special needs” and was “on medication for several health and mental issues, to include growth hormone disorder and A.D.H.D.”</p><p>Court papers showed that the suspect had sought to change his name in part because of what his father described in the petition as a “tragic event” in 2015. The report said that episode took him several years and some therapy to process.</p><h2 id="link-402e9ed8">Some students experienced their second school shooting in seven years.</h2><p>Among the Florida State students who had to shelter in place were young adults who had been students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., during a 2018 mass shooting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Joshua Gallagher, a law student at Florida State who went to Stoneman Douglas, <a href="https://x.com/JoshBGallagher/status/1912925855019319361" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> on Thursday that he never thought he would experience such gun violence again.</p><p>“Then I’m in the FSU Law Library,” where he heard an alarm: “active shooter on campus,” Mr. Gallagher wrote on X. “No matter your politics, we need to meet — and something has to change.”</p><p>Ilana Badiner was in eighth grade at a school near Stoneman Douglas when the mass shooting took place in 2018.</p><p>“It’s terrible that this keeps happening,” said Ms. Badiner, now 21 and a communications major at Florida State who is set to graduate in two weeks. “This is crazy that it’s happened twice to me. Like, what are the odds?”</p><p>Jesus Jiménez<!-- --> <!-- -->Adeel Hassan<!-- --> and <!-- -->Neil Vigdor<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Susan C.
