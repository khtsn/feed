He was taken to the hospital and identified as a student and the son of a local sheriff’s deputy.</p><p>The Tallahassee Police Department, which is leading the investigation, said on Friday that all of the injured victims, as well as the suspect, were expected to survive. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida directed flags to be flown at half-staff through Monday.</p><p>Chief Lawrence E. Revell, who leads the Police Department, said on Friday that the suspect would face charges up to and including first-degree murder.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is what we know.</p><h2 id="link-759a4058">The shooter used a handgun in the attack.</h2><p>The suspect arrived on campus nearly an hour before the attack, the police said.</p><p>The first shot was fired at 11:56 a.m. near the student union building at Florida State, a public university with an enrollment of more than 43,000, eight days before the last day of classes for the spring semester. The gunman used a handgun, law enforcement officials said at a news conference on Thursday.</p><p>Officers from the university’s Police Department quickly responded, and when the gunman did not comply with their commands, they shot and wounded him. He was taken into custody and to the hospital, where he invoked his right to remain silent, Chief Revell said.</p><p>The chief said the suspect was also armed with a shotgun but added that it was unclear whether he had used it in the attack. The police believe that he acted alone and did not appear to have any connection to the victims.</p><p>Once the shooting began, an emergency alert told the university community to shelter in place, an order that was not lifted until 3:20 p.m. Some terrified students huddled in the student union basement, crying and using their cellphones to let loved ones know what was happening. Police officers cleared classrooms using a safe word, “Seminole,” to identify themselves as the authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The university canceled classes and business operations for Friday, and student athletics through the weekend.</p><h2 id="link-abee654">One of the victims worked at the university.</h2><p>The family of Robert Morales, a dining coordinator for Florida State, confirmed on Friday that he was killed in the shooting.</p><p>Mr. Morales had worked at the university for nearly a decade, and studied criminology at the same school, according to his LinkedIn profile. His brother, Ricardo Morales Jr., <a href="https://x.com/Rick714Canes/status/1913040263368356325" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media that he “loved his job at FSU and his beautiful wife and daughter.”</p><p>Mr. Morales previously served as an assistant football coach at Leon High School in Tallahassee, according to a <a href="https://leonhighathletics.com/2025/04/18/statement-from-leon-athletics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from the school’s athletics department. He had “a true passion for mentoring young athletes,” the department said, and was committed to shaping the lives of his players both on and off the field.</p><p>The second slain victim was identified as Tiru Chabba by the law firm that his family has retained.</p><p>Mr. Chabba, 45, was a father of two children. He lived in Greenville, S.C. and was on the Florida State campus on Thursday as an employee of a campus vendor when the shooting took place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At least some of the six people who were injured were students. Richard McCullough, the university president, said he had visited some of them at the hospital, Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, the hospital said that all six of the wounded were expected to make a full recovery, with one person in fair condition and the other five in stable condition. </p><h2 id="link-548b6a44">The suspect is the son of a sheriff’s deputy.</h2><p>Sheriff Walter McNeil of Leon County identified the gunman as Phoenix Ikner, 20, and said that his stepmother was a sheriff’s deputy. The handgun was his stepmother’s former service weapon, which she had bought for personal use, Sheriff McNeil said. It’s not unusual for deputies to be allowed to purchase their former service weapons, officials said.</p><p>The sheriff’s office website listed the stepmother as a school resource officer at a Tallahassee middle school. Sheriff McNeil said she had been with the office for more than 18 years and called her service “exceptional.”</p><p>The sheriff said the suspect was a “longstanding member” of the department’s youth advisory council, which engages young people and seeks their input, and had taken part in a number of training programs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“So he has been steeped in the Leon County sheriff’s family,” the sheriff said, calling Thursday’s shooting “tragic.” He vowed to do everything possible to prosecute the suspect and “make sure that we send a message to folks that this will never be tolerated here in Leon County.”</p><p>Chief Revell said on Friday that the suspect was being treated for “significant injuries” sustained during the shooting. Once released, he will be taken to a local detention facility, the chief said.</p><h2 id="link-1febf773">The suspect’s childhood was tumultuous.</h2><p>Custody battles consumed the suspect’s childhood, court papers showed. His parents fought over every aspect of his care while accusing each other of manipulation and abuse.</p><p>In 2015, the suspect’s biological mother, who is not the local sheriff’s deputy, was accused of taking him to Norway in violation of a custody agreement, when the suspect was 10 years old. At the time, she said she was going to travel with him to South Florida for spring break but instead took him to Norway, according to an affidavit.</p><p>His mother pleaded no contest to a charge of failure to return a child and was sentenced to 200 days in jail and two years of probation. She was ordered to not contact her son, a stipulation that she fought after completing her sentence, according to Fred Pearson, her lawyer at the time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Court papers showed that the suspect had sought to change his name from Christian Gunnar Eriksen to Phoenix Ikner in part because of what his father described in the petition as a “tragic event” in 2015.</p><p>The affidavit also said that he had “developmental delays and special needs” and was “on medication for several health and mental issues, to include growth hormone disorder and A.D.H.D.”</p><p>In an interview on Friday, the mother said she remained bewildered by the shooting and had been against the presence of firearms in her son’s life. “I feel bad for the people at F.S.U.,” she said. “My heart goes out to them. My heart is also with my son.”</p><h2 id="link-402e9ed8">Some students experienced their second school shooting in seven years.</h2><p>Among the Florida State students who had to shelter in place were young adults who had been students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., during a 2018 mass shooting.</p><p>Joshua Gallagher, a law student at Florida State who went to Stoneman Douglas, <a href="https://x.com/JoshBGallagher/status/1912925855019319361" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> on Thursday that he never thought he would experience such gun violence again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Then I’m in the FSU Law Library,” where he heard an alarm: “active shooter on campus,” Mr. Gallagher wrote on X. “No matter your politics, we need to meet — and something has to change.”</p><p>Ilana Badiner was in eighth grade at a school near Stoneman Douglas when the mass shooting took place in 2018.</p><p>“It’s terrible that this keeps happening,” said Ms. Badiner, now 21 and a communications major at Florida State who is set to graduate in two weeks. “This is crazy that it’s happened twice to me. Like, what are the odds?”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Christina Morales<!-- -->, <!-- -->Halina Bennet<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jesus Jiménez<!-- -->, <!-- -->Adeel Hassan<!-- --> and <!-- -->Neil Vigdor<!-- -->. <!-- -->Susan C.
