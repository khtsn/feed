    <h1>Boeing Shares Drop After South Korea Plane Crash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“The accident’s root cause could be among several factors,” Myles Walton, an analyst at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note, adding that workmanship and design weren’t likely to blame. Still, “commercial aerospace’s infrequent but sometimes catastrophic accidents” present unique risks for aircraft manufacturers like Boeing, he wrote.</p><p>Boeing’s shares have lost about 30 percent of their value this year, as the company has faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/business/boeing-planes-production.html" title="">labor strife, questions about quality control, mounting debt and supply chain issues</a>.</p><p>In January, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/23/business/boeing-alaska-airlines-door-plug.html" title="">a panel blew off a 737 Max</a> plane during an Alaska Airlines flight, resurfacing concerns about the safety of Boeing planes five years after two fatal crashes of the Max, a successor to the 737-800. Some 33,000 Boeing workers walked off the job for two months starting in September. And the company’s chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who took over this summer, announced plans in October to restructure the company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/business/boeing-job-cuts.html" title="">including by cutting about 17,000 jobs</a>, or 10 percent of Boeing’s global work force.</p><p>Boeing’s 737-800 line of planes has a stellar safety record, aviation experts said. Nearly 200 airlines worldwide use the plane, which has been flying for more than 25 years. Thousands of the aircraft are in circulation, accounting for about one in seven passenger planes in service around the world, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm.</p></div></div>
