Now her family, still waiting for an asylum decision, is questioning whether it is worth staying. The main reason they made the harrowing trip to the United States — on foot, nearly two months — was fear that Josselin and her brother would be kidnapped or killed by gangs in Guatemala.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“We had a dream for a better life,” her father, German Corea, said in Spanish this week. “But the reality is that it’s not better anywhere. In Guatemala, you’ve never heard of someone killing someone in school.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Josselin’s teachers and family remembered her as a vibrant young woman, who excelled at math and science and loved to sing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Landon Edwards for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Another student shot and killed Josselin at school on Jan. 22.

Mr. Corea came to the country before his wife and children and is not part of the asylum case, so he is at more risk of being deported.</p><p>“This is the country that took her away from me,” Mr. Corea said. “And if one day we go back to our country, she’ll be there with us.”</p><p>Josselin had been thriving in Nashville, where she loved to sing and play soccer. She had once turned down a three-day trip to make sure she did not miss school. She wanted to become a doctor, her uncle, Carlos Corea, said: “A doctor saves lives, and this was not fair to her.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Jan. 22, a student who the police said had espoused hateful rhetoric online brought a pistol to Antioch High School in South Nashville. He opened fire, killing Josselin and injuring another student before shooting himself. The police have not said whether the shooter was targeting Josselin. </p><p>A month into 2025, there have been at least 15 shootings on or near a school campus, according to the <a href="https://k12ssdb.org/interactive-map" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">K-12 School Shooting Database</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Family members said that Josselin was the happiest during her quinceañera party, where she had dances with her father and uncles. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Landon Edwards for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The loss of Josselin, who frequently translated for her family, has driven some of them to speak out.</p><p>“I am not scared — I’m telling the truth, I’m telling people how I feel,” Carlos Corea said in Spanish.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>That is why he and another of Josselin’s uncles, Juan Corea, found themselves on the steps of the Tennessee State Capitol on Monday, surrounded by a crowd of Democratic lawmakers, students and gun control activists. As they left the nearby church where they held a funeral service for Josselin, they saw people gathered with pictures of their niece and understood what was going on.</p><p>“We never thought that we’d be in this position, but we wanted to give people our message,” Carlos Corea said later. The two men carried pictures of Josselin, in her quinceañera tiara and a glittering red gown.</p><p>There have been protests for gun control in Nashville before, most notably in 2023 after three third graders and three staff members were killed at a private Christian school. But with lawmakers arriving to debate the creation of a state immigration czar, the crowd at this protest repeatedly tied together the threat of immigration enforcement with their fears of gun violence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Juan Corea has been reminiscent lately about the dance he did with his niece at her quinceañera party, where he told her to go after her dreams.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Landon Edwards for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Carlos Corea became involved in a gun violence protest after seeing people gathered with his niece’s photos near her funeral.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Landon Edwards for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p> Through a translator, Carlos Corea spoke to the crowd on behalf of his family. As they cheered, he raised a fist in the air.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In the silence of the home where they gathered for weekly meals, Josselin’s relatives have been unable to rest. Her Uncle Juan has been thinking about the dance they shared during her birthday celebration, where he told Josselin he loved her. Her father is contemplating activism in her name.</p><p>“We have support, but what I tell all parents that have had their children taken away in schools: Don’t let it stay that way,” German Corea said. “Continue doing what you can so that there is justice for our children. If we remain with our hands tied, this will continue to happen again.”</p><p>While Antioch High School has reopened, with an additional school resource officer and new metal detectors, Josselin’s cousins who attended the school with her are too afraid to return. They will enroll soon at a new school, family members said.</p><p>On Thursday, Josselin’s pink coffin was loaded onto a plane for her journey home to Guatemala. There, her grandparents and aunt were waiting for her.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
