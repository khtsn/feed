Trump’s victory.</p><p>Now a Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City is seizing on that anxiety and proposing that the city open its own grocery stores to bring down costs.</p><p>The idea has gained momentum in other cities as a way to address so-called food deserts, where supermarkets are scarce. Chicago and Atlanta are moving forward with proposals, and there are already city-owned grocery stores in Kansas and Wisconsin.</p><p>Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist state lawmaker who is running for mayor of New York City, will announce a plan on Thursday to build five municipal grocery stores — one in each borough.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Everywhere I go, I hear New Yorkers talking about the outrageous prices of groceries,” he said in an interview. “This is a bold and workable plan.”</p><p>Mr. Mamdani <a href="https://twitter.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1857410216733651146" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a video</a> last month, which went viral, featuring voters in working-class neighborhoods who supported Mr. Trump. Many expressed concerns about the cost of living, reflecting a feeling that is evident across the nation.</p><p>Municipal grocery stores could lower costs by using city land or buildings, buying food wholesale and being exempt from property taxes, supporters say. The approach is part of a broader push by progressive groups to offer <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/news/building-the-public-options-field/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public options for banking, broadband and housing</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Zohran Mamdani, who is running for mayor of New York City, will announce a plan on Thursday to build five municipal grocery stores — one in each borough.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Blesener for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>In New York, the Democrats who are running against Mayor Eric Adams in the June primary have released a flurry of proposals to distinguish themselves in a crowded field and address affordability.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, has focused on <a href="https://www.ramosfornyc.com/a-new-day-for-childcare" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universal child care</a> and raising the minimum wage. Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn, released a <a href="https://www.zellnor.nyc/rebuild-nyc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plan to build one million homes</a> and supports free universal after-school programs.</p><p>Brad Lander, the city comptroller, has called for <a href="https://www.landerfornyc.com/issues" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more affordable housing</a>, based on a plan he supported in the Gowanus neighborhood. Jim Walden, a former prosecutor, will release a housing plan next week that calls for utilizing 30,000 low-income and rent-stabilized units that are not currently available.</p><p>Roughly 43 percent of New York voters named cost of living as their top concern for state lawmakers — more than crime or immigration, according to a <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2024/12/10/hochul-job-approval-favorability-ratings-up-a-little-remain-negative-only-33-of-voters-would-re-elect-hochul-57-want-someone-else/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siena College poll</a> this week.</p><p>Mr. Adams, who is running for a second term while facing a federal corruption trial in April, has focused on affordability as a re-election campaign theme. He recently rolled out a series of proposals and announcements designed to make living in the city more manageable, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/nyregion/adams-income-tax-cut-nyc.html" title="">a proposed tax cut</a> for low-wage earners.</p><p>Mr. Mamdani said that his grocery store plan was in line with his other proposals to make buses free and to halt rent increases on rent-stabilized apartments. He said that he was not surprised that voters had drifted to the Republican Party because Democrats had not provided a compelling alternative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“If we want to bring these New Yorkers back to the Democratic Party, then we have to show them that we’re serious about making their life more affordable,” he said.</p><p>Andrew Lamas, an urban studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that Mr. Mamdani’s proposal was laudable, but that the logistics of running grocery stores were complicated and the city should examine different models like cooperatives.</p><p>“The city can play a very important role in catalyzing the development of supermarkets, but it has a lot of options about how to do that, and some pose more risks and challenges,” he said.</p><p>In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson, a progressive Democrat, is <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/08/08/city-owned-grocery-store-chicago-study/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finalizing a plan for city-owned grocery stores</a>. A 105-page feasibility study found that the idea was “necessary, feasible and implementable.”</p><p>The city could provide subsidies to a store through discounted rent, free utility bills and direct funding to cover shortfalls, according to the study. The upfront costs to create three stores in Chicago could be about $26 million.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>S. Mayumi Grigsby, Chicago’s chief policy officer, said in an interview that neighborhoods on the city’s south and west sides needed more options because many grocery stores had closed in recent years.</p><p>In Madison, Wis., the <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/news/2024-11-18/promise-kept-city-of-madison-secures-lease-for-maurers-market-on-s-park-st" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first grocery store is opening</a> in the first floor of a mixed-use affordable housing building owned by the city. There is a <a href="https://www.ruralgrocery.org/learn/publications/case-studies/St_Paul_Success_Story.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">city-owned supermarket</a> in St. Paul, Kan., a city with 600 residents, where full-time supermarket workers received city-funded benefits.</p><p>In Atlanta, Mayor Andre Dickens plans to open the city’s first municipally subsidized grocery store next year. He has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C51dfOqP-TS/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed frustration</a> that larger chains were not interested in helping the city address food deserts.</p><p>“We’ve reached out to grocery chains and even offered incentives — no takers,” Mr. Dickens said on social media earlier this year. “So we will make it happen for the people directly!”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Criminal to Power Broker: </strong>John Chan was a Chinatown gangster before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/chan-china-nyc-influence.html">remaking himself into a powerful force in New York politics</a> — one closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Slowdown in Enforcement: </strong>For eight months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/nyregion/new-jersey-state-police-slowdown.html">traffic enforcement on New Jersey’s highways plummeted</a>.
