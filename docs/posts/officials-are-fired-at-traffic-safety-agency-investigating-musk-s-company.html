Even after the layoffs, the agency continues to employ more people than at the beginning of the Biden administration, the agency said in a statement.</p><p>“The last administration grew NHTSA by a whopping 30 percent,” the agency said in a statement.</p><p>“We have retained positions critical to the mission of saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes,” the agency said. “We will continue to enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment.”</p><p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of the traffic safety agency’s investigations into Tesla is based on four accidents involving technology that the carmaker calls supervised full self-driving.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">James Stukenberg for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One of the investigations into Tesla is based on four accidents involving technology that the carmaker calls supervised full self-driving, which can steer, brake and navigate Tesla cars in some situations.

In another of the accidents, a person was injured.</p><p>Tesla’s self-driving technology relies on cameras to survey a car’s surroundings, in contrast with competitors like Waymo, a unit of the same company as Google, that also uses lasers and radar to recognize objects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The traffic safety agency has been looking into whether Tesla’s technology failed when visibility was poor because of glare from the sun, fog or dust.</p><p>Mr. Musk has often argued that Tesla self-driving technology is safer than human drivers.</p><p>The technology is also crucial to Tesla’s future and share price. As Tesla sales have flagged, falling 1 percent last year even as the global market for electric vehicles rose 25 percent, Mr. Musk has shifted the company’s focus to autonomous driving technology and plans for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/business/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk.html" title="">self-driving taxi.</a></p><p>The technology will help make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far, Mr. Musk told investors last month.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-ewing">More about Jack Ewing</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
