Districts were given until the end of June this year to eliminate banned mascots.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since taking office for his second term, Mr. Trump and his administration have waged a relentless campaign against what they argue are illegal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and have threatened entities that do not fall in line and eliminate such efforts.</p><p>The president has said he would slash funding for low-income students in states that fail to do away with such programs. New York’s Education Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/new-york-trump-dei-order.html" title="">was the first to publicly refuse to comply with the order</a>.</p><p>Massapequa school leaders filed a federal lawsuit seeking to keep the “Chiefs” name, but the judge in the case recently moved closer to dismissing it after finding they had failed to provide sufficient evidence for their claims, including that the mascot qualified as protected speech.</p><p>In a social media post this week, Mr. Trump criticized New York’s policy and called for Ms. McMahon to intervene.</p><p>“Forcing them to change the name, after all of these years, is ridiculous and, in actuality, an affront to our great Indian population,” the president wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a statement included in the federal Education Department’s announcement, Kerry Watcher, the Massapequa Board of Education president, welcomed the investigation.</p><p>“Attempts to erase Native American imagery do not advance learning,” Ms. Watcher said. “They distract from our core mission of providing a high-quality education grounded in respect, history and community values.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ed Shanahan is a rewrite reporter and editor covering breaking news and general assignments on the Metro desk.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
