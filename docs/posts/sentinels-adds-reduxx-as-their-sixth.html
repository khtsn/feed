In the following year, Oxygen were strong contenders for a shot at Ascension, but they once again fell short at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/372558/oxygen-esports-vs-tsm-challengers-league-2024-north-america-stage-2-lr3" target="_blank">fourth</a> place. Following this result, Oxygen <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/387878/oxygen-esports-disbands-valorant-roster" target="_blank">disbanded</a>, leaving Reduxx free to explore his options.</p>

		<p>im confused. why do sen need a sixth? i feel like reduxx would get to play more if he was actually on a team as a player and not a sixth (not saying that it&#39;s bad that he was signed to sen, congrats to him).</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4205290">
		
		
		<p>franchise teams need a 6th substitute member. Honestly I agree with him being signed to them but he&#39;s 17 so can&#39;t play franchise until next season anyways.</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4205302">
		
		
		<p>i wouldn&#39;t say that they need a sixth man. yeah some personal things could come up or the player could be injured, but that is very unlikely to happen. we had about 4(?) subs this year i think and thats throughout 44 teams so there is a kinda low chance.</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4205391">
		
		
		<p>theirs also a chance of VISA issues or someones so sick that they cant play, but that is also very rare.</p>

			<p>I thought the rule that requires teams to have a sixth man was lifted after the first year of partnership? Or am I tripping?</p>

		<p>Firepower wise yeah but Reduxx hasn&#39;t doesn&#39;t have much experience in anything other than Duelist. Obviously not booting Zekken off the Duelist role so it&#39;ll be a long road if they want to mold him into another role. They&#39;ll have 3 duelists on the team if Zellsis goes lol</p>
