Around the same time, Iran’s U.N. ambassador met with Elon Musk, an overture to President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inner circle. And on Friday, it will hold talks in Geneva with European countries on a range of issues, including its nuclear program.</p><p>All this recent diplomacy marks a sharp change in tone from late October, when Iran was preparing to launch <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/world/middleeast/iran-threatens-retaliation-israel-strikes.html" title="">a large retaliatory attack</a> on Israel, with a deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps warning, “We have never left an aggression unanswered in 40 years.”</p><p>Iran’s swing from tough talk to a more conciliatory tone in just a few weeks’ time has its roots in developments at home and abroad.</p><p>Five Iranian officials, one of them a Revolutionary Guards member, and two former officials said the decision to recalibrate was prompted by Mr. Trump winning the Nov. 5 election, with concerns about an unpredictable leader who, in his first term, pursued a policy of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/politics/iran-sanctions.html" title="">maximum pressure</a>” on Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But it was also driven by Israel’s decimation in Lebanon of Hezbollah — the closest and most important of Iran’s militant allies — and by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/04/world/middleeast/iran-economy.html" title="">economic crises at home</a>, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/world/middleeast/iran-economy-currency-rial.html" title="">the currency has dropped steadily</a> against the dollar and an energy shortage looms as winter approaches.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Iran’s swing from tough talk to a more conciliatory tone was prompted in part by the results of the U.S. election, which will return Donald J.

They asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, which could put them in danger.</p><p>They said Iran suspended plans to strike Israel following Mr. Trump’s election because it did not want to exacerbate tensions with the incoming administration, which was already lining up cabinet nominees who were hostile to Iran and staunch supporters of Israel. Mr. Trump’s stated plans to end the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, however, appealed to Iran, the officials said.</p><p>Before the U.S. election was even held, Iran sent word to the Biden administration that, contrary to claims by some American intelligence officials, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/middleeast/iran-trump-assassinate.html" title="">not plotting to assassinate Mr. Trump</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Wednesday that Iran welcomed the truce between Hezbollah and Israel, adding that “Tehran maintains its right to respond to Israel’s airstrikes on Iran last month, but it will take into consideration regional developments such as the cease-fire in Lebanon.” </p><p>In the view of Sanam Vakil, the Middle East director for Chatham House, a British policy research group, it seems clear that Iran is responding to the coming changes in Washington, as well as the changed domestic and regional geopolitical landscape it now faces.</p><p>“It all came together, and the shift in tone is about protecting Iran’s interests.” Ms. Vakil said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dahiya, a mostly Shiite Muslim suburb of Beirut where Hezbollah holds sway, was heavily bombed by Israel.

Mr. Pezeshkian has a lot of power over domestic policy and some influence in foreign affairs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Just days after the U.S. election, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/world/middleeast/elon-musk-iran-trump.html" title="">met with Mr. Musk</a>, the billionaire entrepreneur who has Mr. Trump’s ear, at the ambassador’s residence in New York to discuss reducing tensions with the incoming Trump administration. Two Iranian officials described the meeting as promising.</p><p>In Iran, the reformist and centrist factions rejoiced at the news.</p><p>But conservatives lashed out, calling the ambassador a traitor, signaling the kind of internal struggle the government faces over engagement with anyone in the orbit of Mr. Trump, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">exited the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018</a>, imposed tough sanctions on the country and ordered the killing of a top general, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html" title="">Qassim Suleimani</a>, in 2020.</p><p>Facing backlash over the meeting with Mr. Musk, Iran’s foreign ministry issued a denial after three days that it had ever taken place. And last week, after a U.N. agency censured Iran for preventing international monitoring of its nuclear program, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-iaea-uranium.html" title="">Tehran reacted defiantly</a>, saying it was accelerating the program, while also insisting that it “stands ready for productive engagement.”</p><p>Several senior Iranian officials have publicly said Iran was open to negotiations with the Trump administration to resolve nuclear and regional issues. This itself is a shift from Iran’s position during the first Trump administration that it would not negotiate with Washington and that its regional policies and weapons development were strictly its own business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Iran is now applying restraint to give Trump a chance to see whether he can end the Gaza war and contain Netanyahu,” said Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat and nuclear negotiator who is now a Middle East and nuclear researcher at Princeton University, referring to Israel’s prime minister. “If this happens, it will open the path for more comprehensive negotiations between Tehran and Washington.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The old bazaar in Shahr-e Ray, a city south of Tehran, in January.

Iranian media also reported resentment rising among the more than one million displaced Shia Lebanese, who looked to Iran as their protector and patron.</p><p>In an unusually brazen assessment, Mehdi Afraz, the conservative director of a research center at Baqir al-Olum University, an Islamic institution, said <a href="https://x.com/GanjiAkbar/status/1861494308215333324" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Iran underestimated Israel’s military power</a> and that war with Israel was not “a game on PlayStation.”</p><p>“Our friends from Syria called and said the Lebanese Shia refugees who support Hezbollah are cursing us up and down, first Iran, then others,” he said during a panel discussion at the university. “We are treating war as a joke.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Khamenei, who has demonstrated a degree of pragmatism when survival of the Iranian regime seemed at risk, sent a senior adviser, Ali Larijani, a veteran centrist politician, to Beirut in mid-November.
