The repatriation is only the second by the Dutch since a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/arts/design/dutch-restitution-report.html" title="">2020 report</a> by a government advisory committee recommended returning art and other objects taken during four centuries of the country’s colonial era.</p><p>The report was part of the Netherlands <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/01/world/europe/netherlands-king-slavery-apology.html" title="">reckoning with that legacy</a> and involvement in slavery. The country was returning “objects that should never have been in the Netherlands,” Eppo Bruins, the minister of education, culture and science, said in a statement.</p><p>The exchange shows an evolving restitution process, after several former colonial powers in Europe pledged to return prized historical objects to countries in Africa, Asia and South America. Countries like France and Belgium, which have thousands of such treasures in public collections, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/design/restitution-france-africa.html" title="">have moved slowly,</a> however, hindered by the arduous work of identifying, tracing and returning the often delicate objects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Dutch government was following an expanded definition of which objects are eligible for return that was adopted after the 2020 report. The objects are not just those looted in conflict, but also seized by missionaries, for example, or smuggled by mercenaries and other colonial-era runners.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A kettle was among the items returned to Indonesia by the Dutch government.

The Indonesian Repatriation Commission also filed a claim for traditional weapons, jewelry and other treasures that were looted in the early 20th century.</p><p>To return them, Dutch researchers had to prove the objects’ provenance. While researchers were able to trace the objects’ historical paths from kingdoms in Indonesia to museums in the Netherlands, it is often difficult to produce the archival evidence needed to prove where looted objects come from, said Jos van Beurden, an independent researcher who specializes in restitution. The recommendations of the 2020 report eased some of these requirements.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The objects will now be sent to the National Museum in Jakarta, where they will likely be housed among other restored objects, said Mr. van Beurden, who has visited the museum.</p><p>Critics of the repatriation process have questioned how poorer countries will store the returned objects. But that should be of no concern to former colonial powers, said Marieke van Bommel, director general of the <a href="https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/en/about-wereldmuseum-amsterdam" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Museum of World Cultures</a> in the Netherlands, a network that includes the Amsterdam museum.</p><p>“The thief cannot tell the rightful owners what to do with their property,” Ms. van Bommel said.</p><p>The Dutch museum has been in talks with its Indonesian counterparts for more than a decade, long before it became government policy to return the artifacts, she said. Other efforts to return objects have usually been driven by collaboration between museums, rather than the pledges by government leaders.</p><p>“One of the bad things of colonialism was the creation of so much distrust,” Mr. van Beurden said. “But, trust is growing between the two parties so that they can discuss it.”</p><p>Unlike some other former colonies, Indonesia had the resources and cultural muscle to reclaim its looted objects, he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Netherlands holds thousands of artifacts from around the world, mostly in museums, but some may also still be part of private collections, making it harder to trace them.</p><p>Nigeria and India have also filed repatriation claims. At least four Dutch museums are known to <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2021/03/four-dutch-museums-have-114-benin-city-items-in-their-collections/#:~:text=In%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20they%20are,published%20in%20the%20coming%20week." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">house objects</a> that British soldiers looted from the Benin kingdom on Africa’s West coast, while the <a href="https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/2694123#page/1/mode/1up" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copper manuscripts</a> of India’s 17th century Chola Empire are listed as donated to the Leiden University by a Dutch family.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>China’s Risky Power Play: </strong>As China pushes to dominate the South China Sea, it is increasingly willing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/15/world/asia/south-china-sea-philippines.html">use force to drive out the Philippines</a>, a treaty ally of the United States, raising fears of a superpower showdown.</p></li><li><p><strong>Endangering ‘Pura Vida’: </strong>Costa Rica’s lush rainforests were a tourist paradise.
