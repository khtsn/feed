He added, “we are trying to work on a path forward that de-escalates tensions.”</p><p>Manbij has long been a flashpoint in the civil war in Syria — and the Islamic State tried to take advantage of the chaos it created there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>As part of its self-declared caliphate that seized large areas of territory in Syria and Iraq, ISIS took control of Manbij in 2014. Two years later, and with American assistance, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces liberated Manbij as part of a rout of the Islamic State in northern Syria.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces at a funeral on Saturday for comrades who were killed in Manbij during clashes with Turkish-backed factions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Delil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But the city later became a focus of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-invasion-isis.html" title="">Syrian factions battling for control</a> in the region. Last week, the Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw under a cease-fire deal with the Turkish-backed fighters known as the Syrian National Army.</p><p>The initial agreement was <a href="https://x.com/MazloumAbdi/status/1866615394238116008" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struck on Dec. 10</a> with the help of American negotiators. It required the Syrian Democratic Forces to not only withdraw from Manbij, but also to pull back to the eastern side of the nearby Euphrates River. The river was a dividing line between the Kurdish fighters and their Turkish-backed rivals under a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/world/middleeast/trump-turkey-invasion-syria.html" title="">tenuous 2019</a> agreement brokered by the Trump administration.</p><p>For years, the Kurdish-led soldiers have been America’s most reliable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-kurds-history-facts.html" title="">partner in Syria</a>, liberating cities seized by the Islamic State and detaining around 9,000 of its fighters. Around 900 American troops are mostly based in northeast Syria to prevent the extremist group from rising again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Turkey has long seen the Kurdish forces as an enemy. The Turkish government says the Kurdish fighters in Syria are allied with the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., which has fought the Turkish state for decades and is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the United States.</p><p>American officials hope the Kurds’ withdrawal from Manbij will ease tensions with the Turkish-backed fighters who, in recent days, have attacked Kurdish positions around Kobani, east of the Euphrates River, according to Kurdish military officials, activists and Syria analysts. Kobani is a Kurdish-majority city on the Turkish border, and holds enormous emotional significance for the Kurdish fighters who reclaimed it from the Islamic State in 2016 after a monthslong siege.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kobani, a Kurdish-majority city in Syria.

Mazloum Abdi, the Kurdish military commander, <a href="https://x.com/MazloumAbdi/status/1869098729577284034" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on the social media platform X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But it is not clear if President-elect Donald J. Trump will agree, given that he sought to withdraw American soldiers from Syria during his first administration and changed his mind only after the resignation of some of his most senior military and diplomatic advisers.</p><p>Mr. Miller, the State Department spokesman, said the Biden administration was talking to Turkey about the tensions in Kobani and elsewhere in northern Syria but declined to give specifics.</p><p>“It’s a very challenging issue,” Mr. Miller said. “There are longstanding tensions between Turkey and these groups. And so it is not an easy path forward, but it is certainly one that we’re pursuing.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
