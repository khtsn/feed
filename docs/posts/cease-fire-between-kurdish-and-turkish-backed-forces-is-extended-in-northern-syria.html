fighters</a> in northern Syria threatened on Wednesday to upend already shaky cease-fire agreements and stymie American attempts to contain escalating violence just as the country’s 13-year civil war is ending.</p><p>A spokesman for the American-backed, Kurdish-led fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces said skirmishes with a militia supported by Turkey had broken out in a number of sites around the city of Kobani and the nearby Euphrates River.</p><p>“Our forces are currently establishing defensive positions to counter ongoing attacks and safeguard all areas within north and eastern Syria, with a particular focus on the defense of Kobani,” Farhad Shami, the Kurdish forces’ spokesman, <a href="https://x.com/farhad_shami/status/1869363736831578264" title="" rel="noopener

the international community.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Efforts on Wednesday to reach Turkish defense officials for a response were not immediately successful.</p><p>Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, <a href="https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-december-17-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said earlier this week</a> that the outgoing Biden administration was trying to help prevent “any increase in fighting in northern Syria at this point.”</p><p>But a senior American official in the region said Wednesday that the Kurdish fighters faced a “not imminent but serious” threat from the Turkish-backed militia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div

Mazloum Abdi, would need to be embraced by the new rebel-led government in Damascus to “keep his people safe and ISIS detained.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The violence highlights the precarious, fragmented condition of Syria just days after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. The rebel alliance that toppled him — which is not involved in the Kurdish-Turkish clashes — is struggling to assert control over the country and keep its government functioning.</p><p>For years, the Kurdish-led forces, who control northeastern Syria, have been America’s most reliable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-kurds-history-facts.html" title="">partner in Syria</a>, liberating cities seized by the Islamic State and detaining around 9,000 of its fighters. Around 900 American troops are based in Syria to prevent the extremist group from rising again.</p><p>But Turkey has long seen the Kurdish forces in Syria as an enemy, allied with the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., in Turkey. The P.K.K. has fought the Turkish state for decades and is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the United States.</p><p>Kobani is a Kurdish-majority city on the Turkish border and holds enormous emotional significance for the Kurdish fighters who reclaimed it from the Islamic State in 2016 after a monthslong siege.</p><p>Last week, the dueling Kurdish forces and Turkish-backed militia agreed to a pause in fighting in Kobani and a cease-fire in Manbij, about 37 miles to the southwest, in agreements that the United States helped broker.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Miller, the State Department spokesman, said on Tuesday that the cease-fire in the Arab-majority city of Manbij would last “into the end of this week,” but did not give an exact day for when it would end, or whether it might be extended again.</p><p>Both Kobani and Manbij have long been flash points in Syria, especially after the Islamic State took advantage of the chaos of the civil war.</p><p>With the help of American troops, the Kurdish fighters liberated both cities from the Islamic State in 2016, leading to the end of the extremists’ self-declared caliphate that had seized large parts of Syria and Iraq.</p><p>Manbij later became a focus of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-invasion-isis.html" title="">Syrian factions battling for control</a> in the region. Last week, the <a href="https://x.com/MazloumAbdi/status/1866615394238116008" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw</a> from Manbij under a cease-fire deal with the Turkish-backed fighters known as the Syrian National Army, and to pull back to the eastern side of the nearby Euphrates River. The river was also a dividing line between the Kurdish fighters and their Turkish-backed rivals under a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/world/middleeast/trump-turkey-invasion-syria.html" title="">tenuous 2019</a> agreement brokered by the Trump administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kobani, a Kurdish-majority city in Syria.

The city’s police forces would remain and residents would not be displaced. American troops would monitor the situation in hope of establishing a cease-fire across northern Syria.</p><p>But it is not clear if President-elect Donald J. Trump will agree, given that he sought to withdraw American soldiers from Syria during his first administration.</p><p>Mr. Miller said the Biden administration was talking with Turkey about the tensions but declined to give specifics.</p><p>“There are longstanding tensions between Turkey and these groups,” he said. “And so it is not an easy path forward, but it is certainly one that we’re pursuing.”</p><p>Eve Sampson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
