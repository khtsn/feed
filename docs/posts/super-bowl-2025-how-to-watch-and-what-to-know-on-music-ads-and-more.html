It plans to stream the game free and will be doing a pregame show starring Olivia Culpo, a model, influencer and the wife of the San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey, with a red carpet and a focus on celebrities, fashion and culture.</p><p>The red-carpet show will begin at 3:30 p.m. Eastern time, and the game will kick off around 6:30 p.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h3 id="link-1cd49c3f"><span><strong>What musical acts are performing?</strong></span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kendrick Lamar, who cleaned up at the Grammy Awards on Sunday, is performing at the Super Bowl’s halftime show.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Blake/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Fresh off his five wins at this year’s Grammy Awards, Kendrick Lamar gets an even bigger stage as the main event of the Super Bowl’s halftime show, where he will be joined <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/magazine/sza.html" title="">by SZA</a>. That a centerpiece of Mr. Lamar’s performance will very likely be his song “Not Like Us,” which is a direct attack on the rapper Drake, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-not-like-us.html" title="">might require some explanation</a> for people who are less familiar with his work.</p><p>Before the game, Jon Batiste, the Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, will sing the national anthem; Trombone Shorty, a fellow New Orleans musician, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/arts/music/lauren-daigle.html" title="">Lauren Daigle</a>, a superstar in Christian music, will perform “America the Beautiful”; and the actress and singer Ledisi will perform “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”</p><h3 id="link-4239f6de"><span><strong>Will President Trump be there?</strong></span></h3><p>It appears he will be. The U.S. Secret Service said on Tuesday that it is making plans for President Trump to attend the game in person.</p><p>“The U.S. Secret Service has been on the ground for days, working in close collaboration with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners, as well as the NFL, to implement a comprehensive security plan,” Anthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesman, said in a statement sent to White House pool reporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump would be the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, with the visit to the Superdome in New Orleans coming a little more than a month after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000009903732/new-orleans-truck-attack.html" title="">a deadly truck attack</a> near the venue.</p><p>In addition to his expected appearance, Mr. Trump will be part of Fox’s pregame show, as the network will feature a prerecorded interview with him that is expected to air at 3 p.m. Eastern time. </p><h3 id="link-21e24faa"><span><strong>What about the commercials?</strong></span></h3><p>The days of being shocked by Super Bowl commercials are mostly over, as the bulk of the ads are released in advance. But for some viewers, watching at home will be their first time seeing the ads.</p><p>Among those to watch: one for the mayonnaise brand Hellmann’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX9qfSEKyuc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that recreates a classic film scene</a> from “When Harry Met Sally,” starring the original actors from the movie, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, with help from the actress Sydney Sweeney. In another movie tribute, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris, are in a spot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTppVzG8gpU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for the ice cream maker Häagen-Dazs titled “Not So Fast, Not So Furious.”</a></p><p>And fresh off last year’s success, Dunkin’ is back with the DunKings, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llpIRuVXm0s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which the company teased</a> during the Grammys, featuring appearances from Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h3 id="link-202c008a"><span><strong>Will Taylor Swift be there? Is there any chance she gets engaged?</strong></span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taylor Swift joined Travis Kelce on the field after Kansas City’s win in the A.F.C. championship game on Jan. 26.

On Monday, during the N.F.L.’s Opening Night with players, Mr. Kelce nodded to Ms. Swift’s father being an Eagles fan but said he expected her family to rally around Kansas City for this game.</p><p>As for the question of whether a third straight Chiefs Super Bowl win could end with a Swift-Kelce engagement, betting markets currently view it <a href="https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/news/nfl/taylor-swift-super-bowl-59-odds-see-which-props-you-can-bet-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as a very remote possibility</a>. When asked if he planned to present a ring to anyone special after the game, Mr. Kelce did not take the bait.</p><p>“Anyone special? A Super Bowl ring?” he said to the gaggle of assembled reporters. “Next question.”</p><h3 id="link-6da9255a"><span><strong>Any other significant others to watch for?</strong></span></h3><p>Another fixture at Chiefs games is Brittany Mahomes, the wife of quarterback Patrick Mahomes. While Ms. Mahomes gave birth to the couple’s third child, Golden, on Jan. 12, Mr. Mahomes said on Monday that he expected his whole family to be in New Orleans for the game.</p><p>The entire Kelce crew — Travis’s brother, Jason; sister-in-law (and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/media/kylie-kelce-podcast.html" title="">podcasting star</a>), Kylie; and parents, Donna and Ed — is likely to be there. The rooting loyalties of that group, however, might be divided, as Jason Kelce was a star player for the Eagles and Kylie Kelce is a longtime fan of the team.</p><p>Firmly on the Eagles side of things is Anna Congdon, the partner of Philadelphia’s superstar running back Saquon Barkley, who has built up <a href="https://www.instagram.com/annacongdon/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a sizable social media following</a> of her own. <a href="https://people.com/saquon-barkley-engaged-anna-congdon-amazing-fiancee-exclusive-8784424" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The couple recently announced their engagement</a> after having been together since college.</p><h3 id="link-36300d7d"><span><strong>What about other celebrities?</strong></span></h3><p>There are always celebrities at the Super Bowl, but there are a few that are particularly strong bets to show up for this matchup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The actors Paul Rudd and Jason Sudeikis are devoted fans of the Chiefs and regularly attend games. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/style/new-hope-pa-bucks-county.html" title="">Bradley Cooper</a> is a huge Eagles supporter who famously played a superfan in the 2012 film “Silver Linings Playbook” and has frequently been spotted on the sidelines.</p><p>The parties and events leading up to the game will draw several major celebrities to New Orleans. Shaquille O’Neal is hosting Shaq’s Fun House on Friday with a performance from Ludacris, and Uber is planning a party with a performance from Travis Scott.</p><h3 id="link-2c77376a"><span><strong>OK, but what time is the Puppy Bowl?</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>If you need some football action ahead of the Super Bowl, the annual Puppy Bowl will air on Animal Planet at 2 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Davis/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In a charming bit of counterprogramming before the game, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/style/puppy-bowl-adoption.html" title="">the Puppy Bowl’s Lombarky trophy</a> will be in play again this year, as Team Ruff and Team Fluff, filled with more than 100 puppy players from 80 shelters and rescues across 40 states, face off on Sunday at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Animal Planet.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
