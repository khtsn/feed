    <h1>Will North Carolina’s MAGA Extremists Doom Trump?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Donald Trump was in North Carolina just two weeks ago. And a week before that. And on Friday he’ll be back. <em>Again.</em> It seems he can’t get enough of my state.</p><p>Or maybe he’s worried that we’ve had enough of him.</p><p>Other Republicans are, with excellent reason: North Carolina isn’t just one of the seven principal battleground states in the 2024 presidential election. It’s a singularly fascinating test case of how much MAGA extremism could cost the Republican Party — and Trump himself.</p><p>Of those seven states (North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada), North Carolina is the only one that Trump won — by less than 1.4 percentage points — in 2020. But he can’t be remotely confident about it this time around.</p><p>And that’s not just because Vice President Kamala Harris’s replacement of President Biden on the Democratic ticket has palpably reanimated the party here or because her campaign is making significant investments in the state, where the latest voter surveys suggest that <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/north-carolina/trump-vs-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she and Trump are effectively tied</a>. It’s also because of how miserably the state’s Republican lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/governor/general/2024/north-carolina/robinson-vs-stein" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been polling</a> in his race against the state’s Democratic attorney general, Josh Stein, to become the next governor. The Real Clear Politics <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/governor/general/2024/north-carolina/robinson-vs-stein" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">average of recent surveys</a> gives Stein an 8.7-point advantage over Robinson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Could Robinson — who is shockingly light on leadership credentials and even more shockingly heavy on misogynistic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/opinion/mark-robinson-antisemitism.html" title="">antisemitic</a>, homophobic and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/opinion/north-carolina-governor-robinson.html" title="">altogether repulsive remarks</a> — lose by a margin big enough that he takes Trump down with him? It’s an unusual question, a reverse direction twist on the common belief that the person at the top of a party’s ticket can affect candidates lower down. But it’s on Republicans’ minds, and it’s a constant topic of conversation among political insiders here.</p><p>Mick Mulvaney, who served as Trump’s acting chief of staff in the White House, recently <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/video/trump-is-weighed-down-by-nc-gov-nominee-mark-robinson-mick-mulvaney-morning-in-america/9962293/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told News Nation</a> that his former boss had a peculiar challenge in North Carolina. “Trump is being weighed down by a very unpopular Republican candidate for governor,” Mulvaney said.</p><p>Doug Heye, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee who has worked for several U.S. senators from North Carolina, told me this week that he speaks regularly to Republicans in the state and is hearing “real concern — from voters, from consultants — that Robinson could hold back Trump.”</p><p>Heye said that he’s skeptical of that, as are many other political analysts, who tell me that they’re hard pressed to come up with precedents for a down-ballot candidate determining a presidential contender’s fate.</p><p>Several of them also point out that polls in past races for governor here have underestimated the Republican candidate’s eventual performance. And they say that while they can imagine many North Carolinians splitting their tickets and voting for Trump and Stein — much as some of them voted for Trump and the state’s current, term-limited governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in 2016 and 2020 — they doubt that a Trump supporter would abandon him because Robinson gives the whole Republican Party such a hateful and unhinged taint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I’m very wary of the reverse coattails theory,” said Amy Walter, the publisher and editor in chief of The Cook Political Report, which last week moved the presidential race in North Carolina from “leans Republican” to “tossup” on the same day that it moved the Robinson-Stein race from “tossup” to “leans Democratic.”</p><p>But among statewide Republican candidates in the MAGA age, Walter added: “I don’t know that there’s been anyone more controversial than Mark Robinson. Robinson seems to be in a whole different category.” And that could translate to more Democrats in North Carolina turning out to vote — to make sure Robinson loses — and some Republicans being discouraged enough about the election to stay home.</p><p>With North Carolina, you never know. From 1980 to the present, only one Democratic presidential candidate (Barack Obama in 2008) has won the state, but from 1992 to now, only one Republican candidate for governor (Pat McCrory in 2012) has triumphed. The state’s two senators are Republican, and its junior senator, Ted Budd, beat his Democratic opponent, Cheri Beasley, by more than three percentage points in 2022.</p><p>That casts Harris as an underdog. But North Carolina political analysts sense more Democratic energy than in any presidential contest since Obama prevailed here.</p><p>And then <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/mark-robinson-maga-north-carolina-governor/678506/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there’s Robinson</a>. Although he’d be the state’s first Black governor, he has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-attacked-civil-rights-movement/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denigrated the civil rights movement</a>. His religious talk — he proudly and assertively promotes himself as a conservative Christian —<span>  </span>goes hand in hand with a vicious streak: He has called Michelle Obama a man, <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/north-carolina-politics/mark-robinson-north-carolina-paul-pelosi-attack-social-media-post/275-fc7cbe5f-f3b0-48c6-8242-89df8bd419ae" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that the attack on Paul Pelosi was a sexual tryst gone bad, told an audience of North Carolina churchgoers in late June that “<a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/07/05/lt-gov-mark-robinson-at-nc-church-meeting-some-folks-need-killing/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some folks need killing</a>” and, several years ago, posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.k.robinson.3/videos/10157101046142360/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video of himself</a> on Facebook saying that abortion is “about killing a child because you weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down or your pants up — and not get pregnant by your own choice — because you felt like getting your groove thing on.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wG-ZdJydee8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stein used part of that statement in an ad</a> that his campaign released in early June. It <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/08/29/nc-mark-robinson-governor-race-skirt-abortion-ad-polls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marked a turning point</a> in the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For Robinson, bad news and bad headlines keep on coming: about his campaign’s <a href="https://www.politicsnc.com/p/robinson-is-broke-while-harris-surges?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1696689&amp;post_id=148301703&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=7guy9&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lack of money</a>; about Republicans’ <a href="https://andersonalerts.substack.com/p/mark-robinson-nc-campaign-divided" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frustrations with its direction</a>; about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/mark-robinson-military-commission-attendance/679663/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his apparent failure</a>, during his four years as lieutenant governor, to attend even one meeting of North Carolina’s Military Affairs Commission, on which he sits; about allegations (which his campaign has strenuously denied) that in the 1990s and early 2000s, he was <a href="https://www.theassemblync.com/politics/nc-election-governor-republican-mark-robinson-porn-allegations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a regular at Greensboro, N.C., porn shop</a>s, visiting as often as five nights a week to watch videos in a private booth.</p><p>“Robinson is not fully vetted at this point,” Paul Shumaker, a Republican strategist here, told me on Tuesday, saying that there’s no telling what else might come out. Shumaker isn’t persuaded that Robinson’s troubles will doom Trump, but he thinks there’s a solid chance that Trump — who not only endorsed Robinson but also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/opinion/trump-mark-robinson-north-carolina.html" title="">called him “better than Martin Luther King”</a> — will feel compelled to un-endorse him.</p><p>Cutting someone loose? Trump? I can’t imagine it.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-52714da7">For the Love of Sentences</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stewart Sawyer/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In The Wall Street Journal, Dan Neil <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/cars/2024-mazda-mx-5-miata-review-timeless-fun-in-a-tiny-package-7474de64?mod=lifestyle_feat4_cars_pos2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bemoaned</a> the mismatch of his aged endoskeleton and his assignment to review a low-lying, physically inaccessible car by alluding to the god of Graceland: “After a lifetime of swiveling and gyrating, my pelvis has left the building.” (Thanks to Trevor Hale of Washington, D.C., for nominating this.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In The Washington Post, Ron Charles <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/08/29/life-impossible-matt-haig-midnight-library-author-review/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soured</a> on a new novel by Matt Haig: “Charming moments and light touches of wit run throughout ‘The Life Impossible,’ but they’re overwhelmed by the story’s commitment to refrigerator magnet inspiration.

So the many rave reviews for “Longlegs,” which was released in July, caught my attention, and when it began streaming for a rental fee on Apple TV+ about two weeks ago, I watched it right away. What a letdown. Comparisons between Nicolas Cage (<a href="https://movieweb.com/nicolas-cages-longlegs-appearance-explained/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wearing prosthetics and heavy makeup</a>) as the madman in this clunker and Anthony Hopkins in “Lambs” are beyond absurd — like trying to pass off a half-eaten bag of stale Cheetos as a wheel of the finest Cheddar.</p></li><li><p>One perk of aging is the music library you amass, so large that you forget some of your favorites and, rediscovering them, get to enjoy them all over again.
