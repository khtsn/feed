Six people died in the facility on Tuesday, as a raging river exploded out of its banks and swept through villages and towns around the Spanish city of Valencia, on the country’s east-central coast.</p><p>Among them was the town of Paiporta, where residents said the water came without warning. It had not even been raining on Tuesday night when the water from the river swept in suddenly.</p><p>Staff members at the nursing home tried to move residents to safety on the second floor but did not manage to get everyone, and some of them drowned, said a town official.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The floods killed at least 205 people in Spain, in the deadliest natural disaster in the country’s recent history, with almost all of those deaths, 202, in the Province of Valencia, the authorities said on Friday. More than 60 of the victims were killed in Paiporta, a working-class town on the southern outskirts of the city of Valencia, according to the official, Vicent Ciscar, the town’s deputy mayor.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A nursing home in Paiporta where six residents died.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emma Bubola/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The body of a teenage girl was pulled out of her parents’ cafe in Paiporta, according to several residents who saw it, and laid with her favorite white shoes in the town’s square in front of a pink church. </p><p>Many older people in Paiporta died trapped in their ground-floor apartments. Other people drowned in their cars, which, two days after the disaster, now lay overturned, crashed and piled together amid weeds, like huge dominoes of sheet metal.</p><p>“It was like a tsunami,” said Carmen Aviles, 53, who said people put their heads and hands out of their car windows and cried for help as their cars spun wildly like boats adrift in the furious current on Tuesday night. “The worst was to see people die,” she said. “It swallowed them up.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Rescuers in Paiporta were still pulling bodies out of the mud on Thursday. First they had extracted the bodies they found on the streets, then those they found in homes.</p><p>The rescuers then moved on to garages, where people got caught by the water as they rushed but failed to drive away from the floods in their cars in time.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A bridge piled with debris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Ramos/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Firefighters were pumping water out of the underground garage of the Hiperber supermarket on Thursday, where they believed they would find more bodies in the two floors of underground parking, said Sgt.

Others wept on the phone as they threw buckets of brown water out of their homes. Still others cried as they searched the ravaged landscape for objects they had lost.</p><p>Mr. Ciscar cried in the town hall, in front of the Rambla del Poyo River that on Tuesday night swelled and swallowed his town.</p><p>“Inside the houses there was a lot of wreckage, a lot of mud and a lot of dead people,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Consum supermarket.

The orange groves alongside the highways were battered and covered in mud.</p><p>Crowds of people were walking away from Paiporta, where there was no running water, food or electricity. Some were fleeing on foot, carrying their pets. Others pushed shopping carts, bearing bottles of water and food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Virtually nobody in Paiporta had a car anymore. Hundreds of overturned cars filled the town’s streets, so damaged and dirty that it seemed impossible they had only been there for a little more than a day.</p><p>Help was coming, though not nearly as fast as residents needed. Hundreds of army personnel, police officers and firefighters have been deployed to the area for rescue operations, as well as helicopters and planes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Overturned cars filled Paiporta’s streets.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Ramos/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In Paiporta, the authorities started distributing food on Thursday, the deputy mayor said, and in the city of Valencia, they have been offering shelter to people stranded there.</p><p>Ms. Aviles ran a shop that the swollen river had swept through.

But everything else was gone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In the neighborhood, anger mixed with sorrow as many locals wondered why nobody had warned them about the incoming flood. It did not rain in the area before the flood, local residents said, but in the upper reaches of the river, torrential downpours — a year’s worth of rain in a few hours — caused the waters of the Rambla del Poyo to swell.</p><p>“How did nobody tell us,” asked Isabel Vicente. “We are in the 21st century.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marks on an office wall showed how high the water had risen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Ramos/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>José Bautista<!-- --> contributed reporting from Madrid, and <!-- -->Roser Toll Pifarré<!-- --> from Barcelona.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
