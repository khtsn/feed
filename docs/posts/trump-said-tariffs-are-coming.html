    <h1>Trump Said Tariffs Are Coming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump said today that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/economy/trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada.html" title="">impose a 25 percent fee on all goods imported into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada</a>, along with an additional 10 percent levy atop existing fees on goods from China. The tariffs, which are set to take effect at midnight and target America’s three largest trading partners, would be Trump’s most wide-reaching trade action to date.</p><p>The president has threatened the same levies against Mexico and Canada before, only to delay them after the countries promised to crack down on immigration and drug trafficking — his stated goal. But during a White House news conference today, Trump insisted that there was no chance for a last-minute deal to avert the measures.</p><p>“The tariffs, you know, they’re all set,” he said. “They go into effect tomorrow.”</p><p>The new import fees will have significant consequences for companies that rely on international supply chains, and are also likely to result in higher costs for American consumers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/carmakers-nissan-stellantis-tariffs.html" title="">Carmakers like Nissan could be hit particularly hard</a>. Toymakers, too, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/tariffs-china-toys.html" title="">bracing for financial troubles</a>.</p><p>Trump said he would continue to negotiate with the president of Mexico, where there has been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/americas/mexico-border-migration-trump-tariffs-deadline.html" title="">sharp drop in the number of people trying to cross the border into the U.S.</a> In contrast, the president has expressed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-canada-trade-tariffs.html" title="">special brand of loathing</a> for Canada, where the economy is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/canada/trump-canada-tariff-economy-impact.html" title="">suffer a brutal blow under the new tariffs</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, middle, with world leaders in London, yesterday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Neil Hall</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-56ed9925">Zelensky and Trump clashed over peace prospects</h2><p>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">returned home today after a whirlwind diplomatic tour</a> that included humiliation, by President Trump, and a warm embrace, from European leaders. He vowed to use all diplomatic avenues to pursue an end to the war between Ukraine and Russia, but acknowledged that there was “a long way to go.”</p><p>Trump’s support still appears to be eroding. After Zelensky suggested that the path to peace would be long and difficult, Trump today dismissed his remarks as “the worst statement that could have been made,” adding: “America will not put up with it for much longer!”</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>drones now do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/03/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-drones-deaths.html" title="">most of the killing in the war in Ukraine</a>.
