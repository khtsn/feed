Farming, logging and other industries that drive forest destruction can boost local economies, but Brazil’s fund would effectively pay countries for services that tropical forests now perform for free, such as storing planet-warming carbon and regulating rain patterns.</p><p>With that, the T.F.F.F., as it’s awkwardly called, aims to stop what has long been considered unstoppable. Countries have been losing roughly nine million acres of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/climate/global-forest-tree-loss-wri.html" title="">tropical forest a year</a> over the past two decades. These forests are crucial for storing planet-warming carbon and curbing biodiversity loss.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But promising ideas, like carbon credits tied to curbing tree loss and grant schemes that reward forest protection, have struggled to significantly reverse the deforestation trend globally. Payments from the T.F.F.F. may be large and predictable enough to succeed where other initiatives haven’t.</p><p>Brazil’s proposal envisions a $125 billion fund, which would make it, by some measures, the world’s biggest pot of money to help fight climate change and biodiversity loss. The Green Climate Fund, the world’s largest climate fund financing projects in the developing world, has about half of the proposed capital.</p><p>“We’re at this stage where everybody’s saying, look, in principle, this is crazy,” said Christopher Egerton-Warburton, who leads Lion’s Head Global Partners, an investment banking firm that focuses on sustainable development and has helped design the proposed fund. “But it’s crazy in a kind of interesting way.”</p><p>That’s because, unlike the Green Climate Fund, the T.F.F.F. would require no donations. “What we are asking for is an investment,” said Garo Batmanian, the head of Brazil’s forest service and one of the architects of the T.F.F.F.</p><p>Here is how it would work: Rich nations and big philanthropies would loan the fund $25 billion, to be repaid with interest. Getting that capital is the hardest part, the fund’s backers say. That money would then help attract another $100 billion from private investors. Those investors would be paid a fixed rate of return, just as if they had invested in something with slightly higher projected returns than Treasury bonds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The T.F.F.F. would then reinvest the $125 billion in a diversified portfolio that could generate enough returns to repay investors. The excess returns would be used to pay roughly 70 developing countries based on how much tropical forest they still have standing.</p><p>The design allows the T.F.F.F. to essentially create its own grants for forest protection. While that design is unique, the financial mechanism behind it — getting deposits and reinvesting them for a profit — is common. It’s basically how banks work.</p><p>“The idea is elegant,” said Frances Seymour, a senior adviser on forests for the U.S. State Department. “It’s exciting that it seems to have some political momentum.”</p><p>Brazil aims to finalize the fund’s design by the end of the year, including how it would be governed, and roll it out next year. Brazilian officials are trying to capitalize on the country’s role as host of the U.N. climate summit in 2025 and its turn this year at the presidency of the Group of 20, to beef up support for the T.F.F.F.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palm tree plantations at the forest’s edge in Beluran, Malaysia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jes Aznar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The idea has caught the attention of leaders in United States, Norway, and <a href="https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/canais_atendimento/imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/visita-ao-brasil-do-presidente-da-franca-2013-declaracoes-na-area-ambiental" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">France</a>, as well as the World Bank, which is helping to develop the project. In a meeting about the T.F.F.F. in Rio de Janeiro in July, the bank’s president, Ajay Banga, said that his team had “been encouraged by the work that has gone into this idea.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But, at this early stage in the process, no countries or philanthropies have yet announced that they will put money in the fund.</p><p>The proposal’s ambition has stirred some skepticism about its viability. Getting rich nations to commit $25 billion in loans and investments may be easier than getting that sum in traditional grants. Still, it could be enormously challenging. In the United States, for example, it would require approval by a Congress that is currently divided.</p><p>The fund’s goal is to pay countries with low deforestation rates $4 for each hectare, or 2.5 acres, of standing forest that can be identified by satellite images every year. Those forests can be old-growth or restored, not plantations.</p><p>The fund’s proponents say it is priced at the absolute minimum to help countries stop deforestation from mining in Indonesia, the growth of cocoa crops in Ghana, the expanding ranches in Colombia and myriad other moneymaking drivers of environmental destruction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Countries that receive T.F.F.F funds would also be penalized $400 for each hectare of forest they lost in a given year. The penalty is roughly the same annual revenue that a hectare of land used in a soybean farm in the Amazon would bring in, which is one of the most profitable uses of deforested land in developing countries.</p><p>If a country’s deforestation rate becomes too high, the T.F.F.F payments would stop. There’s also the risk of exposing forest protection funds to the swings of financial markets, which could disrupt the fund’s payments to countries.</p><p>Still, experts say the impact of a reliable stream of forest protection funds that countries can plan their yearly budgets around could be enormous.</p><p>Take Brazil, one of the wealthiest of the forest countries in the developing world. If the fund was already operating, the country would have received some $600 million this year from its existing forests, minus what it lost. That’s almost double the yearly budget of the country’s environment ministry.</p><p>“We have long talked about the advantages of conservation, but haven’t been able to, let’s say, translate that into concrete things people can feel,” said Marina Silva, Brazil’s environment minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But with the fund disbursing real cash for standing trees, she added, politicians who now fight environmental protection policies at every turn may start “counting each hectare of preserved forest and thanking each Indigenous person inside their state.”</p><p>Governments of key forest countries, such as Colombia and Malaysia, have voiced their support for the proposal and its design.</p><p>Finding the resources to rival the economic power ravaging forests, said Nik Nazmi, Malaysia’s environment minister, “will be crucial for us.”</p><p>How the money gets spent may become a source of tension as the fund’s design is finalized. On the one hand, Ms. Seymour said, recipients need some freedom to spend the money without burdensome controls and reporting requirements.</p><p>On the other hand, the fund needs to ensure it is actually helping forests and reaching the communities that protect them. “Reasonable people can disagree on what the right balance is,” she added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The general idea of an investment fund that rewarded standing trees was first imagined some 15 years ago by the economist Kenneth Lay when he was treasurer of the World Bank. Since then, it has been making rounds in the development finance and conservation circles.</p><p>While the project has changed since Brazil took it on last year, it continues to rest on a fairly simple idea, Mr. Lay said. The fund would give developing countries something they have tirelessly fought for: the kind of cheap money to which only wealthy nations have access.</p><p>Many developing nations simply wouldn’t be able to borrow money at a low enough interest rate to fund forest protection on this scale.</p><p>When he talks about the idea, Mr. Lay often gets asked the same question: Couldn’t this work to fund many other of the world’s most difficult causes, such as the distribution of vaccines in the developing world or curbing plastic pollution?</p><p>“You’re right,” he always responds. “But let’s start with the trees.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Brazil’s ‘Elegant’ Idea Could Save Tropical Forests and Generate Returns<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>
