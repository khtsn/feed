    <h1>What to Expect From Helene as It Moves North</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even worse is the heavy tropical rainfall tied up in the storm, which will push further into the Appalachian Mountains, where the National Weather Service has warned the storm will be one of the most significant “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/climate/hurricane-helene-landslide-warnings-appalachia.html" title="">in the modern era</a>.”</p><p>For the third day in a row, from foothills in Atlanta to mountains in Asheville, where rivers and creeks are already pushed to the brim, even more extreme rain is expected to fall on Friday.</p><p>The combination of the wind and the wet soil will make it much easier for trees to fall. And it makes the rough terrain susceptible to landslides.</p><p>As Helene moves north, it will begin to spin around another storm system, which will make it turn left over Tennessee.</p><h2 id="link-456846e0">This weekend: The remnants of the storm will linger</h2><p>Rain will fall across central Kentucky and Tennessee eastward to the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic region the remnants of Helene combine with another weather system.</p></div></div>
