Since the July election, police officers have periodically appeared outside the diplomatic residence in bullet-resistant vests and face masks, sometimes cutting off electricity but then restoring it.</p><p>The last time was in September, days before Mr. González fled the country. Once he was gone, the officers left.</p><p>Some experts say that this time the authorities are trying to force Ms. Machado, who is also in hiding, into exile.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It’s an attempt to send a clear message that no one from the opposition is safe anywhere in Venezuela,” said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, an expert on Venezuela at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research organization in Washington.</p><p>This time, the police are not only cutting off the electricity, but also destroying the fuses so the residence is no longer connected to the power grid, Mr. Arias, the lawyer for the group, said. The police also cut off water, preventing water trucks and food deliveries from gaining access to the residence, he added.</p><p>“What has intensified is the humanitarian issue,” said Mr. Arias. The police, he added, are “turning the embassy into a prison.”</p><p>A senior U.S. diplomat, Brian A. Nichols, called on the Maduro government in a post <a href="https://x.com/WHAAsstSecty/status/1864418431518310856" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on X on Wednesday</a> to allow the six “refugees” to leave the country and denounced the “hostile tactics.”</p><p>The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to requests by email and text messages for comment. Diosdado Cabello, one of Mr. Maduro’s most powerful allies, called the opposition’s accusations of harassment <a href="https://efectococuyo.com/politica/cabello-dice-que-es-una-farsa-el-asedio-a-la-embajada-argentina/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “farce”</a> on his television show.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The activists sought asylum at the residence, nestled between the diplomatic residences of Russia and North Korea, after the attorney general issued warrants for their arrest in March.</p><p>Days later, the Venezuelan Supreme Court banned Ms. Machado from running in the presidential election, and the opposition party threw its weight behind Mr. González.</p><p>The United States and other nations, including Argentina, have recognized Mr. González as the election’s legitimate winner.</p><p>Days after the vote, Mr. Maduro ordered Argentine diplomats to leave the country, and Brazil assumed responsibility for the embassy.</p><p>The Venezuelan government has unleashed a wave of repression against anyone challenging its declared victory, arresting about 2,000 people and charging most with terrorism. Human rights groups have described it as Venezuela’s most brutal campaign of aggression in recent decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>While demonstrators turned out in large numbers after the election, the government backlash has made most Venezuelans reluctant to speak out. A demonstration called by the opposition last Sunday to demand the release of political prisoners had limited attendance.</p><p>Many who did show up covered their faces. Some demonstrators said their imprisoned relatives were sick and having suicidal thoughts.</p><p>“We are not going to accept that they give us only corpses to bury,” said Diego Casanova, explaining that his brother has been imprisoned for four months.</p><p>Ms. Machado has also <a href="https://x.com/MariaCorinaYA/status/1863016490137489408" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused</a> the authorities of harassing her mother with armed hooded agents showing up at her Caracas home with sirens blaring.</p><p>The national legislature last week passed a law making it a crime punishable by up to 25 years in prison for supporting international sanctions against the government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Carlos Blanco, a strategist for Ms. Machado, sees the tightening of the noose around the diplomatic residence as a sign of desperation by the Maduro government.</p><p>“Support for Maduro is really minimal,” he said. “What Maduro has left is pure and hard repression.”</p><p>The activists inside the diplomatic residence declined to be interviewed, citing security concerns, but in interviews with The New York Times shortly after the July election, some described living in a state of constant anxiety.</p><p>“Today we are here,” said Claudia Macero, who led communications for Ms. Machado’s party. “Tomorrow I do not know where we are going to be.”</p><p>Still, they said at the time that they had reached a sort of peace knowing that despite the uncertainty and turmoil, they had followed their consciences and did everything they possibly could to restore democracy to their homeland.</p><p>“If this is the price I have to pay for doing the right thing,” said Pedro Urruchurtu, who oversaw international affairs for the opposition campaign, “then here I am.”</p><p>Isayen Herrera<!-- --> contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Undersea Surgeons: </strong>In a wireless world, it is easy to forget the cables that snake across the turbulent ocean floor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/30/world/africa/subsea-cables.html">Until they snap</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mexican Cartels Turn to Students:</strong> Cartels are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/americas/mexico-fentanyl-chemistry-students.html">luring university chemistry students in Mexico</a> with big paydays in their quest to build fentanyl empires.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Sinking Arctic Hamlet:</strong> Canada is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/americas/canada-arctic-permafrost-thawing.html">losing its permafrost to climate change</a>.
