For starters, the scientists are working to design portable breathalyzers that come closer to establishing how recently a driver used marijuana.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Separately, by observing scores of stoned drivers using a car simulator, they hope to more clearly understand how, and at what levels, cannabis impairs motor skills and reflexes of both habitual and occasional users.</p><p>“Policymakers need data on which to base their policies,” said Tara M. Lovestead, a chemical engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the federal agency <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-researchers-test-new-approach-detecting-cannabis-breath#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20researchers%20at%20the,distinguish%20between%20past%20and%20present" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overseeing the studies</a>. “And there isn’t much data here.”</p><p>In recent decades, marijuana became far more accessible as 39 states sanctioned its medical use and 24 states legalized recreational weed. Roughly 15 percent of American adults reported that they smoke marijuana, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/284135/percentage-americans-smoke-marijuana.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a Gallup survey from 2023 and 2024</a>, compared to 7 percent of people in 2013.</p><p>And a substantial number of Americans acknowledge that they are driving after consuming marijuana. An estimated 14.8 million<span>  </span>motorists said that they have operated a vehicle within an hour of using marijuana, according to an <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2019/06/americans-dont-think-theyll-get-arrested-for-driving-high/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AAA survey</a> from 2019. A <a href="https://cca.virginia.gov/news/2024-statewide-impaired-driving-survey-results-released" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey that Virginia’s cannabis control agency</a> conducted last year showed that 22 percent of drivers in that state admitted to having driven stoned a few times a year or more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Lawmakers in <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/drugged-driving-marijuana-impaired-driving" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least 10 states</a> have prohibited driving with any level of THC, the intoxicating component of cannabis, in a motorist’s system. Legislators in several other states, including Montana, Illinois, Ohio, Washington and Nevada, have passed marijuana driving laws modeled after drunk-driving laws, in which the national standard has become a limit of .08 blood-alcohol concentration. Those states <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/drugged-driving-marijuana-impaired-driving" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have adopted a range of such limits</a>, measured by the amount of THC in a person’s blood.</p><p>But experts say the approach used with drunk-driving does not easily lend itself to marijuana.</p><p>There is no consensus on what level of cannabis use may be safe for driving. That is partly because unlike alcohol, which impairs people in predictable, well-documented ways, the effects of cannabis vary widely based on whether it’s smoked, eaten or drunk.</p><p>People who smoke get high within minutes but effects wear off fairly quickly. Edibles generally are felt within an hour or so, and tend to induce altered states that last longer. Complicating matters, people who use cannabis often tend to become less impaired over time, experts say.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Scientists are using vans outfitted with hippie tapestries to drive to the homes of participants in a trial of regular marijuana smokers.

Her daughter&#39;s boyfriend, Joshua Daugherty, who was driving, told investigators he had smoked marijuana about eight hours before the crash, according to a California Highway Patrol accident report. Mr. Daugherty told officials that he had lost control of his car while trying to avoid hitting an animal on the road and asserted that his frequent use of marijuana meant that it did not impair him, according to the report.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Minnesota State Police trooper demonstrates a drug detection device the agency has been testing as part of a pilot program.

California is among states that outlaw impaired driving, but have not set a specific limit on cannabis use and driving.</p><p>Ms. Kazmark said she was deeply frustrated that the driver served only a few months behind bars after pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charge.</p><p>“I just wish that they could find a way to measure the intoxication and then hold people accountable,” she said. “If they had that in place, more people would think twice before lighting up.”</p><p>Greg Hayes, a prosecutor in Sacramento, said prosecutions of impaired drivers who have used cannabis are rare because investigators lack tools to prove impairment. Another challenge, he said, is a widespread perception by people who consume marijuana that they can safely drive afterward — a claim that is sharply disputed by federal safety officials.</p><p>“You can smell marijuana off the jurors in the courthouse,” Mr. Hayes said. “So you’re going in front of jurors, some of whom, that very morning when they came to do jury selection, smoked marijuana and drove in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Asked about their experiences with marijuana and driving, dozens of New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/us/marijuana-road-safety.html" title="">readers</a> said that they often got behind the wheel after smoking weed or consuming edibles.</p><p>Beth Everett, a novelist and real estate agent in Oregon, said she had come to see her near-daily use of cannabis as something that enhanced, rather than impaired, her driving. Ms. Everett said she drove more than 10,500 miles to promote her latest mystery novel in 2024, most of it after smoking marijuana.</p><p>“I can out-smoke Willie Nelson,” said Ms. Everett, who added that she had a flawless driving record. “I drive in the slow lane, and I don’t ever drive impaired.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Beth Everett said she believes that her use of cannabis enhances her driving rather than impairing it.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Ashley Brooks-Russell, a public health professor at the University of Colorado who is running the federally funded driving simulator study, said alcohol and cannabis alter driving performance in different ways. Drunken drivers tend to speed, tailgate and act more aggressively than sober ones. Drivers who have used cannabis, on the other hand, tend to slow down, she said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Dr. Brooks-Russell said policies on cannabis and driving should not be modeled after drunk-driving laws.</p><p>“I think there’s a wishful thinking that it should be like alcohol,” she said. “But it’s not.”</p><p>In Nevada, which has set a legal limit of two nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood for drivers, Jeff Krajnak, a Navy veteran, said he was stunned to face criminal charges following a fatal car crash in April 2017.</p><p>Mr. Krajnak and his son, who was in the vehicle, were not seriously harmed, but a motorist his car struck at an intersection died.</p><p>Mr. Krajnak, who said he began using medical cannabis to wean himself off opioids he had been prescribed for treatment of chronic pain, passed a field sobriety test shortly after the accident and voluntarily agreed to let investigators draw a blood sample a short time after the crash, according to court documents. He said he had last smoked marijuana about 19 hours before the accident and had not considered himself to be impaired when it happened.</p><p>Weeks after the accident, the police arrested him on felony charges — including child endangerment and driving under the influence resulting in a death — because the blood sample showed he had a higher level of THC than allowed under state law. In their report on the accident, Nevada Highway Patrol investigators concluded that Mr. Krajnak had run a red light before the accident. Mr. Krajnak insisted that his light was green, and two witnesses gave the police contradictory accounts about which car had a green light.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In any case, Mr. Krajnak pleaded guilty to a felony charge of reckless driving and misdemeanor D.U.I. as part of an Alford plea, in which a defendant does not admit guilt but accepts punishment. The plea spared him from going to prison and from losing custody of his son.</p><p>“There needs to be a more common-sense law than just saying someone is over the limit, so they’re under the influence,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ernesto Londoño is a Times reporter based in Minnesota, covering news in the Midwest and drug use and counternarcotics policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ernesto-londono">More about Ernesto Londoño</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
