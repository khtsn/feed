Putin said on Thursday that Russia was still considering whether to keep its military bases in Syria and claimed that most Middle Eastern countries and ruling factions in Syria wanted Russia to stay.</p><p>“I don’t know — we’ll need to think about it,” Mr. Putin said, referring to whether Russia would keep those bases. “We’ll need to decide for ourselves how our relationships will look with those political forces that now control and will control the situation in the country in the future. Our interests need to coincide.”</p><p>Commenting about Syria for the first time since the rule of Russia’s close ally Bashar al-Assad collapsed there on Dec. 8, Mr. Putin tried to cast the stunning turn of events as something other than a defeat for Russia and to portray Russia as being in control of its own fate.</p><p>He was speaking at his hourslong annual news conference, in which he also said he was ready to talk to President-elect Donald J. Trump “any time” and criticized his own security services for failing to prevent the assassination of a Russian general in Moscow this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Syria, Mr. Putin said, Russia was in touch with “all the groups that control the situation,” as well as with “all countries” in the region. The “overwhelming” majority of them, he said, “tell us that they would be interested in our bases in Syria staying.”</p><p>Analysts say that, in fact, Russia’s standing as a world power has suffered as a result of Mr. al-Assad’s fall, especially if it loses its Tartus naval base and Hmeimim air base in Syria. Both have been key to Russia’s ability to project its influence across Africa and the Mediterranean.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crowd gathered in Idlib, Syria, last week to celebrate the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Moscow intervened in Syria’s civil war in 2015, beginning several years of fierce airstrikes that helped Mr. al-Assad stay in power.</p><p>But after the start of the surprise rebel offensive last month, Iranian and pro-Iranian fighters backing Mr. al-Assad on the ground chose not to resist the rebel advance, Mr. Putin said. Instead, they asked for Russia’s assistance in evacuating from Syria, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Putin, responding to a question from NBC News at his year-end news conference, said he had not yet met with Mr. al-Assad, who had fled Syria for Moscow, but that he was planning to. Mr. Putin said he would ask Mr. al-Assad about the whereabouts of Austin Tice, the American journalist abducted in Damascus, Syria, in 2012.</p><p>“I will definitely speak with him,” Mr. Putin said, referring to Mr. al-Assad. And referring to Mr. Tice, he added: “I promise that I’ll ask this question.”</p><p>Mr. Putin also said that he hadn’t spoken to Mr. Trump in “more than four years,” but that he was open to talking to him.</p><p>“I’m ready for this, any time,” Mr. Putin said. “And I’ll be ready to meet, if he wants this.”</p><p>Mr. Putin’s marathon annual news conference has become an annual ritual for the Russian ruler, who first took power in 1999. In recent years, it has been combined with another annual Kremlin rite, the “direct line,” in which Mr. Putin answers calls or letters from across the country, often from people complaining about their local authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The broadcasts, sometimes lasting longer than four hours, are meant to show Mr. Putin’s close engagement with world affairs as well as with the worries of regular Russians. It is also, analysts say, meant to contrast him with Western leaders, whom Russia’s state media often portrays as weak and out of touch.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gen.

He described the killing as the latest failure on the part of Russia’s security services, recalling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/ukraine-russia-dugina-assassination.html" title="">the car bomb that killed Daria Dugina</a>, the daughter of a prominent nationalist, in 2022.</p><p>“They missed these attacks,” Mr. Putin said. “Their work needs to be improved so as not to allow these gravest of blunders for us.”</p><p>Mr. Putin was asked repeatedly about the future of the war in Ukraine, but did not depart from his established — and often contradictory — positions. He said he was prepared “to hold a dialogue without preconditions” on ending the war, but added that talks must be “based on the realities that are developing on the ground” — a signal that Russia would seek to hold on to the territory it has captured in any peace talks.</p><p>He also said — as he often does — that negotiations should be based on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-deal.html" title="">draft deal that Ukraine and Russia discussed</a> in Istanbul in March 2022. The agreement would have declared Ukraine a “neutral” state that would never enter NATO but could join the European Union. It would have also empowered other countries to defend Ukraine if it were attacked anew, but Ukraine and Russia never agreed on a mechanism for such “security guarantees” that satisfied both sides.</p><p>Oleg Matsnev<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
