Pines, president of the University of Maryland, said of Kermit, known for his leading roles on “The Muppet Show” and “Sesame Street.”</p><p>The university teased its commencement speaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEDf0UKJdgg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a video</a> reveal on Wednesday, lauding the speaker as an international superstar, best-selling author, environmental advocate and Peabody award winner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Uh, I guess it’s me,” Kermit said, appearing at the end of the video and flashing a big smile.</p><p>The commencement speech will be a homecoming of sorts for Kermit, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/05/30/movies/muppets-henson" title="">creator, Jim Henson,</a> graduated from the university in 1960 and where a bronze statue of Kermit and Mr. Henson <a href="https://arboretum.umd.edu/jim-henson-statue-and-memorial-garden" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sit in a campus garden.</a> Mr. Henson made the first version of Kermit out of his mother’s old coat and a pingpong ball cut in half for eyes. Mr. Henson, who died in 1990, was the original voice behind Kermit, often referring to the slightly snarky but wise frog <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/17/obituaries/jim-henson-puppeteer-dies-the-muppets-creator-was-53.html?pagewanted=all" title="">as his alter ego.</a></p><p>“Nothing could make these feet happier than to speak at the University of Maryland,” Kermit said in a statement. “I just know the class of 2025 is going to leap into the world and make it a better place, so if a few encouraging words from a frog can help, then I’ll be there!”</p><p>Although commencement addresses are often given by well-known people, colleges have at times thought outside the box. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/nyregion/dyouville-university-commencement-robot-speaker.html" title="">Last year,</a> D’Youville University in Buffalo had an A.I. robot speak at its commencement, drawing mixed reactions from students, faculty members and other attendees.</p><p>And this won’t be Kermit’s first rodeo. In 1996, he delivered a commencement address to the graduating class of Southampton College, then part of Long Island University, where he received an honorary doctorate of amphibious letters for his helping raise environmental awareness.</p><p>Many graduating students decorated their gowns with green stickers that read “Kermit ’96,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/20/nyregion/a-day-for-many-diplomas-and-for-one-famous-frog.html" title="">The New York Times reported</a>, though not all students were thrilled to see a puppet at the podium.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Still, if the past is any indication, Kermit will deliver a positive message to the University of Maryland Terps. At the 1996 commencement, Kermit’s speech included a few ribbits, which he translated for the audience.</p><p>“May success and a smile always be yours,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/12/five-hysterical-commencement-speeches/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post reported</a> he said, “even when you’re knee deep in the sticky muck of life.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
