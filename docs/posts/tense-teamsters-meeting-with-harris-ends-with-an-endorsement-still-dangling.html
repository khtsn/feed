    <h1>Tense Teamsters Meeting With Harris Ends With an Endorsement Still Dangling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the end of the meeting Ms. Harris told the leaders of the union, which has 1.3 million members, “I’m confident I’m going to win this,” according to Mr. Palmer. She also said, “I want your endorsement, but if I don’t get it, I will treat you exactly as if I had gotten your endorsement,” he added — a characterization that Ms. Harris’s campaign aides did not contradict.</p><p>After the meeting, Mr. O’Brien said that he still needed time to consider the union’s next move. Ms. Harris opened the meeting by saying she understood she might not get the union’s endorsement, and that some Teamsters would be voting on issues beyond labor, such as the border, according to another person in the room.</p><p>That person said she had asked that Teamsters leaders educate their members about the bipartisan border control bill that she had backed and that Mr. Trump had killed. She also recalled how Mr. Trump had told Elon Musk that striking workers should be fired, and she said to them, “Listen to the guy when he’s told you who he is.”</p><p>Mr. O’Brien asked for speaking slots at both party conventions, and was given a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/teamsters-boss-sean-obrien-rnc.html" title="">prime-time slot</a> by the Republicans but not by the Democrats.</p><p>He has met with Mr. Trump at his Palm Beach, Fla., mansion and in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Biden has been lauded by many union presidents as the most pro-labor president in history. He walked the picket line with striking United Automobile Workers and included pro-union measures in his signature domestic achievements, the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.</p></div></div>
