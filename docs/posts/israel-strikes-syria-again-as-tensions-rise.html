name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Israel has conducted new airstrikes on Syria’s coast and ground raids in the country’s south, part of a wave of attacks that Israel says is necessary for its security that has raised tensions with Syria’s new government.</p><p>The strikes appeared to be the latest attempt to keep weapons from the Assad regime out of the hands of groups that may be hostile to Israel.</p><p>The Israeli military said on Monday evening that it had targeted a weapons storage facility in Qardaha, former President Bashar al-Assad’s hometown. The town is a few miles from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/world/europe/russia-syria-bases.html" title="">major Russian air base</a> outside the coastal city of Latakia. There were no immediate reports of casualties, according to Syria’s state news agency, SANA.</p><p>Hours later, the Israeli military conducted ground raids into two towns in southern Syria, cutting off roads and searching military barracks before blowing up warehouses and withdrawing, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group based in Britain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The attacks came a week after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel demanded the “complete demilitarization” of much of southern Syria “from the forces of the new regime.”</p><p>Since the Assad regime <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">was toppled</a> in December by a lightning rebel offensive, Israel has carried out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html" title="">hundreds of airstrikes</a> in Syria that it says are aimed at preventing weapons falling into what it considers potentially hostile hands.</p><p>It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/world/middleeast/syria-buffer-israel.html" title="">has also deployed forces</a> into a United Nations-monitored demilitarized zone at its border with Syria, and invaded border villages in southern Syria in what it described as temporary measures to protect its own security. Many Syrians fear that the incursions could morph into a prolonged military occupation.</p><p>Syria’s new government has said that Israel was violating its sovereignty. The attacks have been condemned internationally, with the United Nations <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/un-special-envoy-calls-for-full-restoration-of-syria-s-territorial-integrity/3440413" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying in January</a> that the country’s “territorial integrity, and unity must be fully restored.”</p><p>After violence broke out between Syrian government officers and armed men on the outskirts of Damascus last week, Mr. Netanyahu said he had instructed the military to defend the country’s Druse minority from Syria’s new rulers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/world/middleeast/syria-druse-clash.html" title="">a move that Syrian Druse and government leaders themselves rejected</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Shara, has repeatedly said that Syria is not seeking conflict with Israel. At a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/middleeast/syria-national-dialogue-conference.html" title="">two-day “national dialogue” conference</a> in Damascus last week that was billed as the start of a process to build an inclusive Syrian government, the closing statement rejected Israel’s threat that it would not allow the presence of Syrian armed forces in the country’s south.</p><p>It remains unclear, however, how Syria’s leadership will respond to the Israeli demand.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/bashar-alassad">Bashar al-Assad</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
