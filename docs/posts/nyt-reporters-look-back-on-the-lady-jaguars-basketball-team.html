When I met her more than a decade ago, she was a wide-eyed and curious seventh grader with church-pew manners. She was chatty and clingy, a dreamer with a trusting heart. She played with dolls and sang in a choir. She wanted to be a veterinarian and live in a mansion.</p><p>Hannah came from a home broken by poverty and addiction. She found comfort at Carroll Academy, a court-run day school in West Tennessee for teens in trouble. The Lady Jaguars basketball team that Hannah played on was in the middle of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/sports/basketball/carroll-academy.html" title="">312-game losing streak</a>, stretching over 12 years, which is why I first went to Carroll Academy. She was the youngest player that season.</p><p>Now it was early 2023. The evening sky darkened over Carroll County Jail. I was in the parking lot. A familiar voice was on the phone from the other side of the thick walls.</p><p>It was Hannah, now 24, addicted to meth, caught in a sting operation a few weeks earlier.</p><p>Oh, Hannah. Is that you?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Hi, Mr. John,” Hannah said. I recognized her honeyed, lilting voice instantly. It might have been the only thing that hadn’t changed since she was a girl. I rubbed one hand on my forehead. The other held the phone.</p><p>“You OK?” I asked.</p><p>Hannah was one of nine girls The New York Times had featured in a five-part series in 2012, and then in a follow-up series a year later.

No more sleeping under the bridge near downtown.</p><p>Hannah’s treatment required her to attend at least five substance-abuse meetings a week — Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and the like. The women’s shelter had strict rules, household chores and routine drug tests. She graduated to another house, to a bit more freedom. Eventually she could get a phone.

He wanted Alleyah to grow up and leave their town. “There’s better stuff out there if she can just get away,” he said.</p><p>Weeks later, at 15, Alleyah failed a drug test and was ordered to a rehab center in Memphis, two hours from home.

Waves of them have crashed into communities like these in recent decades — crack, heroin, opioids, now fentanyl, taking shifts filling worlds of tedium and anxiety.</p><p>But methamphetamine is the constant, hiding in the hollers and bridging generations. “Hillbilly cocaine,” a Carroll Academy counselor called it, as inextricable from the landscape as summer humidity. Several of the Lady Jaguars from 2012 have fought meth addictions as young adults, just as their parents did — or continue to do.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><h3 id="link-30462572"><span>KIANA, CONSTANCE, MIRANDA: Better lives for their children</span></h3><p>Most of the former Lady Jaguars live day to day, month to month. Few have secure jobs or anything like a career. They don’t own houses. They don’t have saving accounts, retirement plans or big inheritances. Few have traveled far, and several have never seen the ocean. I remember how surprised I was in 2012 when I learned during a field trip to Memphis that some of the girls had never been on an escalator. Today, most haven’t been on an airplane. I don’t know that any of them voted in the recent elections; Hannah, as a felon, could not, by Tennessee law.</p><p>But none of them complained, at least to me. They did not blame others for their troubles. Every one of them felt that she was in a better place now than ever.</p><p>I marveled at Kiana’s optimistic resilience. Raised by a single father struggling with addiction, she found relative stability over two years at Carroll Academy before she got pregnant and dropped out of high school. As a jobless mother, she began using meth and opioids, along with a boyfriend named Matthew. They broke into houses to feed their addictions. They had more children.</p><p>An overdose episode — Kiana bolted barefoot from their rural home and went missing overnight in the woods — brought police attention and led to charges for child endangerment. Kiana and Matthew went to jail, then rehabilitation, separately. The four children, two girls and two boys, were sent to foster care.</p><p>Kiana told me their story last year as she pulled from a vape pen, kiwi-strawberry flavor. The family was back together, and Kiana and Matthew said that they had been sober for several years. Matthew had a job at a Walmart, working in the meat and produce departments. He set an alarm and reported at 4 a.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-71"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2013</strong> Though Kiana found comfort at Carroll Academy, she never graduated from high school.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-72"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> Kiana’s desire to be a good parent motivates her sobriety.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p>“I would have died without my kids,” Kiana said. “They’re what keeps me going.”</p><p>Kiana is one of the five former Lady Jaguars with children. Adding kids to their lives could have been disastrous for young women living in rudderless malaise. But some found motherhood to be an unexpected motivator — if not immediately — to strive for something more than what they had.</p><p>Kiana’s biggest worry was losing custody of her children again. The family’s house was clean. There was food in the refrigerator and children’s artwork on the walls. Kiana and Matthew had purchased a used truck to replace the dead one out front. Kiana studied for high-school equivalency tests and worked as a clerk at an AutoZone.</p><p>“We made it,” Kiana said. “At least this far.”</p><p>Then she and Matthew broke up. The pup-tent structure of a shared life collapsed. Kiana moved out. She often posts about her struggles on Facebook — her determination to stay sober, to fight for her kids, to never go backward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>At Halloween, she dressed her kids in costumes and took them to the town square to trick-or-treat. “The kids had a blast!” she wrote on Facebook.</p><p>You can’t choose your parents, I thought to myself, but you can choose how to parent.</p><p>I was curious to find Miranda, now living in Kentucky. The last time I saw her, she was newly graduated with a newborn daughter. Akyia was now 11, a bright sixth grader, sitting politely on the same sofa Miranda had as a child. Akyia listened carefully as Miranda detailed her life since Carroll Academy.</p><p>“Once you get out on your own, it’s not rainbows and ice cream,” Miranda said.</p><p>On an end table next to a Bible was a painted sign that read, “Grow through what you go through.” Miranda wanted Akyia to hear everything.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-76"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2013</strong> Miranda with Akyia at 8 weeks, a year after graduating from Carroll Academy.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-77"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> “I’m still trying to figure out where God wants us to be,” said Miranda, with Akyia.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-30"><div><p>Miranda, 30, is a recovering alcoholic. She makes money cleaning houses, but Jesus is her calling. She has the same giggle from childhood, but speaks in the cadence of a preacher, spinning stories of being saved and saving strangers — at Food Giant, Walmart, the gas station, wherever she feels a person needs her intervention. She speaks openly about her alcohol and drug use, her D.U.I. and arrests for drug possession, her suicide attempts, her bouts of loneliness and feelings of abandonment.</p><p>“I’ve never felt so loved,” she said. “I’ve never felt so worthy.”</p><p>She looked at Akyia. Eleven years earlier, a crib had been set up in Miranda’s bedroom in her single mother’s house, under a poster of Justin Bieber. Now Miranda was the single mother, and that baby was headed to middle school. Time marches and echoes.</p><p>But Miranda believes that Akyia will not repeat her mistakes and experience because she will learn from them. Miranda will see to it, she said, by staying close. She smiled at her daughter.</p><p>“She’s a better version of me,” Miranda said.</p><p>Two years ago, they returned home from a Christmas play to find a neighbor on the porch, urging Miranda to drag a mattress into the utility closet and get underneath it.</p><p>Moments later, a massive tornado tore through the roof of the house. It ripped through a candle factory next door and killed more than 50 people and injured hundreds of others across several counties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-31"><div><p>In the closet, everything went deafening and black. Then it went still and quiet. A neighbor banged on the door. “The hardest thing I ever did was let go of my daughter’s hand,” Miranda said.</p><p>I thought of Constance, whose three young children were regular parts of her Facebook posts. Over burgers, her family in tow, Constance cheerfully described her life — the familiar act of pinching pennies while juggling jobs and day care and a son with autism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-82"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2012</strong> On a field trip to Memphis for an N.B.A. game, Constance and others marveled at seeing tall buildings and escalators for the first time.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-83"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> Constance and Elijah are expecting a fourth baby.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-32"><p>As a teen, Constance’s issue was unruly behavior, not drugs or alcohol, and she was a steady presence on the Lady Jaguars. She spent a few post-school years in the party orbit of some of her former teammates, but pulled herself away. She had support from extended family, bounced from job to job, and got into a serious relationship.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-33"><div><p>Now she and her husband, Elijah, who was working to become a licensed barber, were building a family. The two dreamed of buying a house in the next few years, but it still felt improbable. Constance volunteered at her kids’ school and entered their toddler-aged girls in beauty pageants. Elijah coached their soccer and basketball teams.</p><p>This summer, Constance learned that she was pregnant with her fourth child, due by year’s end. The gender-reveal party culminated in an explosion of blue powder. Elijah did a cartwheel and backflip in celebration.</p><h3 id="link-4cccc6b6"><span>DESTINY: ‘I am not my past’</span></h3><p>The hardest Lady Jaguar to find was Destiny. She was the best player on the team in 2012, a rough-edged senior with a quick dribble and a good 3-point shot. On a mural at Carroll Academy, based on one of Ruth’s photographs from the 2012 series, Destiny is frozen in time, shooting a jumper with one person in the bleachers behind her — her grandmother, sometimes the only person, among all the families of the Lady Jaguars, who came to watch the games.</p><p>Destiny was living on the fringes when I last saw her in 2013. Then I lost track of her.</p><p>On a crisp afternoon this past January, Ruth and I found her at Carroll County Jail, the same place where I had reunited with Hannah. Destiny stood before us, wearing jail clothes. She smiled sheepishly. She seemed happy to see us.</p><p>Destiny had lost count of how many times she had been jailed over the years, mostly for minor drug offenses and probation violations. This time, she had been arrested on an assault charge and would spend 56 days in jail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-88"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2012</strong> Destiny was the team’s high scorer and best player.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-89"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> In the years since Carroll Academy, Destiny has spent time living on the streets and in jail.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-34"><div><p>For years, Destiny hid in the shadows, on the streets, trying to live undetected. Alleyah and Hannah had done the same. Once they had rap sheets, they avoided public places and police officers, job applications and rental agreements — anyone or anything that might attract the authorities.</p><p>What struck me most was realizing that no one was looking that hard for them. As children, they were worth rescuing. As adults, they were considered barely worth finding.</p><p>Weeks later, out of jail and wearing donated clothes, Destiny sat across from me in a restaurant booth. She laughed at memories of playing for the Lady Jaguars. She hated Carroll Academy at the time but appreciated it now — a common sentiment. “They cared,” she said. She vowed to start applying the lessons, a delayed effect like a slow-release pill. She spoke as if she had been reading inspirational posters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-35"><div><p>“I’m not going to let my mistakes dictate what my future holds,” she said. “I am not my past.”</p><p>She thought for a moment. “I’m not going to be what people think I am,” she said.</p><p>She wanted to move to Florida, away from bad influences and familiar cops and judges. She needed a fresh start in a new place. I thought of Alleyah, who happened to be in that same mural at Carroll Academy, frozen in time, watching Destiny take a shot.</p><p>“I want to go somewhere different, where nobody knows me,” Destiny said. A few months later, she moved into a rented house a few miles from where she grew up.</p><h3 id="link-1ef97287"><span>SUMMER: ‘You’ve got to break the cycle’</span></h3><p>Her name is Summer, which fits her, carefree as a songbird. In 2012, she was a senior at Carroll Academy, a sweet-souled girl behind a sharp tongue and a tough exterior, admired by her younger teammates. She had a baby boy and a history of drug use, fighting and truancy. Behind closed doors, she cried as she told me the story of her young life.</p><p>She grew up playing soccer and softball, taking ballet lessons and competing in beauty pageants. She dreamed of joining the Air Force and going to college. Then she found trouble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-36"><div><p>“Bad decisions, good intentions,” she told me when she was 17. That become a headline on one of the stories. But something else she said had stayed with me, too.</p><p>“I never blame anyone else for the choices I make,” Summer said in 2012. “But I do think if I was in a better environment, I’d be a better person.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-95"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2012</strong> Summer, middle, with Hannah and Destiny.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-37"><div><p>Now Summer was 30. She sat on a sofa in a three-bedroom rental house she shared with her longtime boyfriend, Junior, raising seven children. The living room was a swirl of kids and bleating screens.</p><p>“I’m in a much better spot than I’ve ever been,” Summer said. Her singsong lilt has not changed through it all.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-38"><div><p>Summer grew up fast, and it might have saved her. She bowed out of the toxic party scene after having a couple of kids and with Junior’s steadying influence. He is the father of the last six children, with a job at a factory that makes motor parts for cars.</p><p>He and Summer lived on the same street where Junior grew up, across from where Summer’s mother was raised. They paid $450 a month in rent. There was a trampoline in the yard, weeds in the rain gutter and, inexplicably, a pair of socks on the roof. Toys cluttered the porch, but inside was neat. School artwork and photos hung on the walls. The large TV was usually on, with at least one child staring at it.</p><p>I thought of all the homes where I had sat with Summer and DeMarion, her first baby — the trailer not far from here, the house outside town, her grandmother’s cabin that burned down.</p><p>Now she had something for her kids that she never had as a girl: stability and a steady address.</p><p>“You’ve got to break the cycle,” Summer said. “You’ve got to be parents who think ‘I don’t want the same thing for my kids.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-99"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> Summer treats her seven kids to happy meals after a soccer practice.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-39"><div><p>Summer has always had a natural calm, on the basketball court at Carroll Academy and now in the madness of a crowded house. On a Friday in May, a birthday party for two of the kids was starting in an hour. She had things to cook and party favors to make. She sat and chatted.</p><p>I had told her about Hannah, about how when I went looking for her, I found her in jail.</p><p>“Really?” Summer said. She sounded surprised, but just a little. “She was so sweet and innocent.”</p><p>The front door swung open. Kids ran in, others ran out, like hockey players trading shifts. Summer noticed Junior outside holding a hose.</p><p>“Why is he giving the dog a bath? It’s going to rain,” she said, mostly to herself.</p><p>Junior walked in. “Your daughter’s literally playing in the mud,” he said. KaMyra, 4, had been inside a moment earlier.</p><p>“You’re literally out there with her,” Summer said. She shrugged. “She’s got to change, anyway.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-102"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> Summer’s youngest child Kayra, born in 2023, getting a bath in the kitchen sink.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-104"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> The kids’ artwork hangs on the walls of their home.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><strong>2024</strong> Summer and Junior have been together for more than a decade.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-40"><div><p>Summer talked about her everyday life — getting kids to schools and sports, KaMyra’s upcoming beauty pageant, building a float for the town’s annual fish fry, staying up at night taking online college courses. Summer hoped to be a counselor, helping kids like she used to be.</p><p>She wanted to find a bigger house, maybe through Habitat for Humanity. (This fall, the family moved into a four-bedroom, two-bath house. “Finally!” she texted me.) She had recently turned 30. The family celebrated at Texas Roadhouse, and Junior gave Summer a necklace with pink rhinestones.</p><p>They took family vacations, a slice of life I didn’t hear from other Lady Jaguars. They had just been in Gatlinburg, Tenn., and they had vacationed on Florida’s Gulf Coast the year before. Summer showed me photos.</p><p>Her children, pining for attention, kept interrupting. “Get out of grown people’s conversations,” Summer said.
