They shouted greetings from afar and tried to snap photos of their faces.

Newly appointed Trump officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/energy-department-layoffs.html" title="">moved to fire</a> most of the 200,000 federal government employees on probation, with plans for what the president has hailed as “large scale” cuts to come. The administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-foreign-aid-freeze.html" title="">seized on creative loopholes</a> to continue to bottle up government spending, despite court orders pausing those efforts. And Mr. Musk has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/elon-musk-doge-fact-check.html" title="">spread misinformation</a> about the work of the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>“Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Democrats have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/democrats-trump.html" title="">struggled to identify a strategy to fight back</a>, still reeling from a decisive loss in November that handed the White House and both houses of Congress to Republicans.</p><p>By banding together, federal workers say they hope to catalyze a wider movement. On balance, more Americans so far disapprove than approve of Mr. Musk’s work with the federal government, although roughly 16 percent are not sure or did not offer an opinion, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/179f0397-db70-4f78-9f3f-7c2d762674b7.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new Washington Post/Ipsos poll found</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hanna Hickman, a former lawyer at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was laid off this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.

Soon, she realized that the email had been deleted from her mailbox — and from those of her colleagues.</p><p>Ms. Ortiz followed up with an agencywide message calling on the E.E.O.C.’s acting chair to resign. At that point, she said, her ability to send emails was shut off. She is still working, but has hired a team of lawyers.</p><p>Ms. Ortiz said she had no regrets.</p><p>“The unknown was not as scary as being complicit and not speaking up,” Ms. Ortiz said in an interview with The Times. “I can exist on cornflakes and community at the end of the day if it means that my soul is intact.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Ortiz said she had no regrets about encouraging her colleagues to resist orders that she called “illegal mandates.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Taurat Hossain for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The E.E.O.C. said in a statement that it had a “longstanding policy prohibiting unauthorized all-employee emails.” The acting chair, Andrea Lucas, said the commission “robustly will comply with the president’s executive orders, including the ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’ executive order.”</p><p>Some civil servants have also turned Slack, the workplace chatting app, into a weapon of resistance.</p><p>The Slack channel of the Technology Transformation Services — the tech-focused arm of the General Services Administration — has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-tech-workers.html" title="">emerged as a forum for protest</a> in recent weeks as employees have pushed back against moves by the Trump administration.</p><p>This week, one T.T.S. employee used the channel to announce to his colleagues that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-tech-workers.html" title="">he was resigning</a>.
