While driving to the National Assembly, the leader of South Korea’s main opposition party appealed to Koreans to rush to the Assembly and hold back soldiers trying to seize the parliament.</p><p>“You must protect the Assembly, the last line of defense for our democracy,” Mr. Lee said repeatedly — in a watershed moment for South Korean democracy and for his own political career. Mr. Lee’s exhortation, relayed by YouTubers, helped attract crowds who slowed down the advance of troops and bought time for lawmakers to vote down Mr. Yoon’s martial law​ decree, forcing the president to withdraw it after just six hours​​.</p><p>Mr. Lee, who has been fighting legal charges that he says are politically motivated, now finds himself in a stronger political position than ever. His party holds the majority in the Assembly and he represents what most South Koreans want: Mr. Yoon removed from office. Polls show he is most favored to win if a presidential election is held now.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/09vid-lee-8745-cover/09vid-lee-8745-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/09vid-lee-8745-cover/09vid-lee-8745-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/12/09/130743_1_09vid-lee-8745_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Lee Jae-myung via Storyful</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>With <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-yoon.html" title="">political turmoil</a> still roiling around him, Mr. Lee looked calm and in control this week — and determined to oust Mr. Yoon quickly. But his party’s first attempt to impeach Mr. Yoon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeachment-analysis.html" title="">failed</a> on Saturday, when the president’s party boycotted the parliamentary vote.

We will try to get this done by Christmas.”</p><p>Mr. Yoon has been barely seen since his martial law collapsed​. ​Prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. Yoon committed insurrection — a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment — when he sent troops into the Assembly. The Justice Ministry has barred ​him from leaving the country, raising the possibility that he could become the first South Korean president to be arrested while in office. But there is confusion over who will run the government if he were to be jailed. ​</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korean soldiers trying get into the National Assembly on Tuesday, December 04, in Seoul.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Yoon’s abrupt and baffling decision to put his country under military rule for the first time in 45 years was driven, in a way, by the country’s increasingly polarized politics: He both despises and fears Mr. Lee and his progressive opposition, which ​has dominated the Assembly​ throughout his term. South Korean politics have long been fractured, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/world/asia/south-korea-election-yoon.html" title="">clash for power</a>​ between Mr. Lee​ and Mr. Yoon​ has been magnified by their differences.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Lee, whose parents made a living cleaning public toilets, was a teenage sweatshop worker before becoming a human rights lawyer, civic activist and politician who spoke for ​the poor. ​But his detractors called him a “populist.”</p><p>Mr. Yoon is the son of a college professor, attended an elite university and became a star prosecutor ​who helped imprison two former presidents. As leader, he pushed for business-friendly policies​ while his critics called him out of touch​ with ordinary people.​</p><p>Mr. Lee’s speech sounds practiced and methodical.

Mr. Lee ​s​urvived <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/world/asia/south-korea-opposition-leader-stabbing.html" title="">a stabbing attack</a> by a right-wing extremist in January. But Mr. Lee said Mr. Yoon’s martial law revealed more flaws in Mr. Yoon’s “impulsive” character than in South Korean democracy.</p><p>​“What he did was so preposterous that it made people wonder whether he was in his right mind,” Mr. Lee said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>When his wife showed him live footage of Mr. Yoon declaring martial law on Tuesday night, Mr. Lee said he told her it was a “deepfake.” Once he realized it was not, he used an online group chat to urge his party members to rush to the Assembly. He and other lawmakers climbed over the walls and fences to enter the Assembly, while angry citizens tussled with the police and troops.</p><p>“I was live on YouTube all the time,” Mr. Lee said. “I knew I could be arrested by troops, but I thought people ​at least could watch me detained.”</p><p>Events in recent years have deepened worries about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/world/asia/south-korea-election-yoon.html" title="">a cycle of political vengeance</a> that has ​consumed South Korean politics and presidents.</p><p>Older conservative South Koreans who hold pro-Yoon rallies in downtown Seoul call Mr. Lee a communist criminal who must be locked up. Political commentators have blamed both Mr. Yoon and Mr. Lee for intensifying political polarization, citing their inability to reach compromise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group of pro-Yoon supporters near the National Assembly, in Seoul, on Saturday.
