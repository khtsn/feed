The draconian halt on goods and aid, including fuel, is also likely to worsen conditions for the roughly two million inhabitants of Gaza, after the 15-month war left much of the coastal enclave in ruins.</p><p>The initial, six-week phase of the original deal between Israel and Hamas expired on Saturday. Though it was punctured by setbacks and mutual accusations of violations, it ultimately saw at least a temporary cessation in the fighting and the exchange of 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight dead ones for about 1,500 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. That deal also allowed for a significant increase of aid into Gaza.</p><p>The next phase of the agreement called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a commitment to a permanent cease-fire in return for the release of all the remaining living hostages in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Instead, hours before its announcement about the halt of aid, Israel proposed a seven-week extension of the temporary cease-fire, during which Hamas must release half the remaining living hostages as well as the remains of half the deceased ones. Upon conclusion of that extension, if agreement were reached on a permanent cease-fire, then all the remaining hostages would have to be released, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.</p><p>“Israel will not allow a cease-fire without the release of our hostages,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Sunday.</p><p>“If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences,” it added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel “will not allow a cease-fire without the release of our hostages.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Evelyn Hockstein</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hamas immediately rejected the Israeli gambit, issuing a statement on Sunday describing the halt in aid as “cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant upending of the agreement.”</p><p>Israel attributed the new proposal to the work of the U.S. envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff. The existing deal was negotiated between Israel and Hamas through third-country mediators including the United States, Qatar and Egypt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last year, the United Nations and aid organizations repeatedly warned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/middleeast/un-panel-gaza-famine.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">a looming famine</a> in Gaza amid widespread hunger during the war, which was sparked by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. While goods are more available now, many Gazans say they cannot afford to buy them, and many depend on humanitarian assistance.</p><p>Palestinians in Gaza were already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/world/middleeast/ramadan-gaza-war.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">struggling to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan</a>, which began this weekend, and is normally a joyous time in the Muslim calendar.</p><p>Two Israeli officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the government believed that with the aid and goods that entered the enclave in recent months, and during the temporary cease-fire, there were enough supplies in Gaza to suffice for several more months. They did not offer further details.</p><p>The officials added that the new restrictions would not apply to the entry of water.</p><p>Under the existing cease-fire deal, Israel was by now supposed to have begun removing its troops from the Philadelphi Corridor, a strategic strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt. By Sunday, there had been no such movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A family preparing a fast-breaking meal in their damaged apartment in Jabaliya, Gaza, on Saturday, which was the first full day of Ramadan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jehad Alshrafi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office said the proposed temporary cease-fire should extend over the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and through the Jewish holiday of Passover, which ends on April 20. In all, about 25 hostages are believed to still be alive in Gaza. Hamas also holds the remains of more than 30 who are believed to be dead.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Steve Witkoff proposed the framework on extending the cease-fire after gaining the impression that, at present, there was no possibility of bridging between the positions of the sides on ending the war, and that additional time was required for talks on a permanent cease-fire,” the statement from the prime minister’s office added.</p><p>The Israeli government has been categorical that the war in Gaza cannot end unless Hamas is disarmed and removed from power there, terms that Hamas has largely rejected.</p><p>On Sunday, Israel also raised the specter of resuming fighting in Gaza, noting in the statement that according to the original agreement, Israel could return to fighting at this point “if it gains the impression that the negotiations have been ineffective.”</p><p>Hamas is unlikely to accept Israel’s new offer without further negotiations, said Aaron David Miller,<strong> </strong>a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The proposal, he said, “allows Israelis to get hostages back without making reciprocal commitments.”</p><p>Eve Sampson<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York, and <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
