The draconian halt on goods and aid, including fuel, is also likely to worsen conditions for the roughly two million inhabitants of Gaza after the 15-month war left much of the coastal enclave in ruins.</p><p>The initial six-week phase of the original deal between Israel and Hamas expired on Saturday. Though it was punctured by setbacks and mutual accusations of violations, it ultimately saw a temporary cessation in the fighting and the exchange of 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight dead ones for about 1,500 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. That deal also allowed for a significant increase of aid into Gaza.</p><p>The next phase of the agreement called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a commitment to a permanent cease-fire in return for the release of all the remaining living hostages in Gaza, who are being held in inhumane conditions, according to reports from hostages who have been freed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Instead, hours before it announced the aid stoppage, Israel proposed a seven-week extension of the temporary cease-fire, during which Hamas would have to<span>  </span>release half the remaining living hostages as well as the remains of half the deceased ones. Upon conclusion of that extension, if agreement on a permanent cease-fire occurred, all the remaining hostages would have to be released, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.</p><p>“Israel will not allow a cease-fire without the release of our hostages,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Sunday. “If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences,” it added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel “will not allow a cease-fire without the release of our hostages.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Evelyn Hockstein</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hamas immediately rejected the Israeli conditions, issuing a statement on Sunday describing the halt in aid as “cheap blackmail” and “a blatant upending of the agreement.”</p><p>Israel attributed the new proposal to the work of the U.S. envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff. The existing deal was negotiated between Israel and Hamas through third-country mediators including the United States, Qatar and Egypt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Last year, the United Nations and aid organizations repeatedly warned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/middleeast/un-panel-gaza-famine.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">a looming famine</a> in Gaza amid widespread hunger during the war, which was triggered by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. While goods are more available now, many Gazans say they cannot afford them, and many depend on humanitarian assistance.</p><p>Palestinians in Gaza were already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/world/middleeast/ramadan-gaza-war.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">struggling to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan</a>, which began this weekend, and is normally a joyous time in the Muslim calendar.</p><p>Abdulrahman Mohammed, 35, a father of four from Gaza City, said the halting of aid has already meant that essential goods like milk, fruit and vegetables were less available. Prices have skyrocketed, he said, adding that some traders were hoarding supplies to sell them later at more inflated prices.</p><p>Two Israeli officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the government believed that the aid and goods that entered the enclave in recent months and during the temporary cease-fire meant there were enough supplies in Gaza for several more months. They did not offer further details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The officials added that the new restrictions would not apply to the entry of water.</p><p>Under the existing cease-fire deal, Israel was by now to have begun removing its troops from the Philadelphi Corridor, a strategic strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt. By Sunday, no such movement had occurred.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A family preparing a meal to break the fast in their damaged apartment in Jabaliya, Gaza, on Saturday, which was the first full day of Ramadan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jehad Alshrafi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu said the proposed temporary cease-fire should extend over the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and through the Jewish holiday of Passover, which ends on April 20.</p><p>In broadcast remarks at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu said, “Steve Witkoff proposed the framework for extending the cease-fire after gaining the impression that there is no possibility, at present, of bridging between the two positions, Israel’s and Hamas’s, regarding the second stage” of the existing deal.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu added that according to Mr. Witkoff, more time for talks was needed to achieve an agreement. “He even defined his proposal as a corridor for negotiations on the second stage,” Mr. Netanyahu added. “Israel is ready for this.”</p><p>But the Israeli government has been categorical that the war in Gaza cannot end unless Hamas is disarmed and removed from power there, terms that Hamas has largely rejected.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Israelis have been shocked by the testimonies of recently released hostages who said they were kept for months in dark tunnels, in constant fear for their lives, with very little food and, in some cases, in shackles. The families of hostages remaining in Gaza have been pleading for the government to end the war and bring them home all at once.</p><p>“President Trump, bring us a better deal, a safer deal,” Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David, a hostage in Gaza, implored on Sunday. “No stages, no phases. One deal to bring everyone home,” he said in a recorded statement distributed by the Hostages Families Forum, a group advocating the release of all the captives.</p><p>Up to 24 hostages are believed to still be alive in Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu said on Sunday. Hamas also holds the remains of at least 35 who are believed to be dead, he added in recorded remarks at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting. “We are not giving up on anyone,” he said.</p><p>“There will be no free lunches,” Mr. Netanyahu said, adding, “If Hamas thinks that it will be possible to continue the cease-fire or benefit from the terms of the first stage, without us receiving hostages, it is sorely mistaken.”</p><p>On Sunday, Hamas reiterated its willingness to begin negotiations toward the deal’s second stage and accused Israel of “a blatant attempt to renege on the agreement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Hamas is unlikely to accept Israel’s new offer without further negotiations, said Aaron David Miller,<strong> </strong>a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The proposal, he said, “allows Israelis to get hostages back without making reciprocal commitments.”</p><p>On Sunday, Israel also raised the specter of resuming fighting in Gaza, noting in the statement that according to the original agreement, Israel could return to fighting at this point “if it gains the impression that the negotiations have been ineffective.”</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Saturday that he had signed a declaration to use emergency authorities to expedite the delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel.</p><p>Eve Sampson<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York, <!-- -->Ameera Harouda<!-- --> from Doha, Qatar, and <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner">More about Isabel Kershner</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
