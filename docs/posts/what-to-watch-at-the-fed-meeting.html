The Fed will release its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. in Washington, after which Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will hold a news conference.</p><div><p>Officials at the Fed are in wait-and-see mode, closely tracking the incoming data for signs that progress on inflation is picking back up after a period of stalling out, or that an otherwise solid labor market is starting to crack. What they also want is greater clarity on what exactly Mr. Trump has in store for the economy after a whirlwind of tariff announcements, government spending cuts and deportations.</p><p>Here is what to watch for on Wednesday.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The dot plot: </strong>With the Fed’s pause well telegraphed, perhaps the most important part of the March meeting will come in the form of the central bank’s new “dot plot.” Released quarterly, it tracks what officials expect will happen with interest rates. The last time the dot plot was updated, in December, officials broadly expected two interest rate cuts this year, or a reduction of half a percentage point. That was significantly less than what was predicted in September, when officials saw a full percentage point decline.</p></li><li><p><strong>How many cuts?</strong> Some economists are bracing for expectations to be scaled back again, with officials signaling just one cut this year. Others think policymakers will stick with two cuts even as they raise their forecasts for inflation and lower those for growth because of Mr. Trump’s policies. For next year, financial markets are pinning their hopes that there will be at least two rate cuts as a weakening economy prompts the Fed to take action.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Trump factor:</strong> Officials are most focused on the net effect of the president’s plans, meaning they are not looking at any one policy individually but taking stock of how each interacts with and potentially offsets another. But given the extent of Mr. Trump’s tariff threats and what he has imposed so far on the country’s biggest trading partners, the global trade war has taken center stage in debates about the economy’s trajectory.</p></li><li><p><strong>A new tariff playbook?</strong> The big question for the Fed is whether it will use a playbook that policymakers employed during the central bank’s last brush with large-scale tariffs in 2019, during the first Trump administration. Back then, the central bank ended up lowering interest rates by 0.75 percentage points as a form of insurance against mounting concerns about growth. Inflation at the time was subdued, giving officials flexibility to look past any temporary rise in consumer prices. The Fed does not appear to have that luxury this time around. The tariffs Mr. Trump has put on the table are far more aggressive and could lead to far higher prices for imports along with slowing exports as other countries retaliate. Inflation, meanwhile, is still uncomfortably high.</p></li><li><p><strong>“Look through it”:</strong> At an event this month, Mr. Powell began to sketch out how the Fed would approach the tariff situation. “In a simple case where we know it’s a one-time thing, the textbook would say look through it,” he said, referring to a situation in which the Fed would not respond to a tariff-related price rise. But a “series” of bigger shocks when inflation is not yet under control could change that calculus, Mr. Powell warned at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business event.</p></li><li><p><strong>Balance sheet calculations. </strong>The Fed’s March meeting could bring about changes to another important instrument in the central bank’s tool kit: the balance sheet. At the last meeting in January, policymakers and their staff discussed the possibility of either slowing or pausing the reduction of the Fed’s roughly $6.8 trillion portfolio of government-backed securities. The reason is to avoid amplifying market gyrations tied to an ongoing standoff over the debt ceiling, which caps how much money the government can borrow.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Will the debt limit fight be a factor? </strong>The Treasury Department is using what it calls “extraordinary measures” to stay below the debt limit. Eventually those measures will be exhausted, meaning Congress will have to raise the debt ceiling. The Fed has been shrinking its holdings since the middle of 2022 and last May, the central bank slowed its pace of allowing maturing securities to roll off. The Fed is trying to avoid a situation in which the amount of cash flowing in the banking system falls too low and causes short-term disruptions in funding markets, as was the case in September 2019.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOWRjM2VmZTItZmIwNC01ZWU1LTg0MjAtNTY2MTkyODNiYzkx"><div id="9dc3efe2-fb04-5ee5-8420-56619283bc91" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/business/fed-interest-rates#9dc3efe2-fb04-5ee5-8420-56619283bc91"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/colby-smith"><img alt="Colby Smith" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/business/author_colby_smith/author_colby_smith-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/business/author_colby_smith/author_colby_smith-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/business/author_colby_smith/author_colby_smith-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-19T16:09:14.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 19, 2025, 12:09 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>With the Fed widely expected to extend its pause on interest rate cuts, most of the attention at 2 p.m. will be on the new set of projections released by the central bank, which show how all 19 officials are thinking about the trajectory for interest rates, inflation, growth and unemployment.

The White House contends its protectionist policies can rejuvenate American manufacturing and reduce the country’s reliance on imports, but economists believe that Mr. Trump risks touching off a protracted global trade war that will badly harm the U.S. economy.</p><p>The latest dour projection arrived Tuesday, when Fitch Ratings cut its U.S. growth forecast for this year to 1.7 percent from 2.1 percent. It explicitly pointed to Mr. Trump’s tariffs — and the “huge uncertainty” around them — as two of the drivers behind a potential economic slowdown and short-term rise in prices.</p><p>The uncertainty is likely to freeze any rate cutting at the Fed, perhaps straining an already tortured relationship between Mr. Trump and Jerome H. Powell, the man he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/business/economy/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-trump.html" title="">handpicked to serve</a> as chair of the central bank in 2017.</p><p>In his first term, the president described Mr. Powell as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/business/powell-fed-interest-rates-trump.html" title="">enemy</a>,” and blasted his colleagues as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/economy/bonehead-trump-jay-powell.html" title="">boneheads</a>,” in a bid to browbeat the Fed into slashing interest rates. Mr. Trump at one point <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/jerome-powell-trump-fed.html" title="">even considered firing</a> Mr. Powell, raising fears that the White House might try to undermine the Fed’s political independence.</p><p>Soon after returning to the White House, the president revived his attacks: He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/business/davos-world-economic-forum-trump.html" title="">said, again, that he would</a> “demand that interest rates drop immediately,” and one of his leading advisers — the tech billionaire Elon Musk — <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888583443962814811" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signaled support</a> for an audit of the central bank. When the Fed chose to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/business/fed-interest-rates" title="">hold rates steady</a> at its last meeting, Mr. Trump charged anew that Mr. Powell and the Fed had “failed to stop the problem they created with inflation.”</p><p>“If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, ‘green’ energy, and fake climate change, Inflation would never have been a problem,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113913720574106648" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in a post on Truth Social</a>.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2IxYTVmZGRiLTA3NmYtNTZmYy1iMjU5LTI5OGZlNTQ5Mzk0MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/business/fed-interest-rates#how-to-read-the-feds-projections-like-a-pro" data-source-id="100000010056229"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/colby-smith"><img alt="Colby Smith" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/business/author_colby_smith/author_colby_smith-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/business/author_colby_smith/author_colby_smith-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/29/business/author_colby_smith/author_colby_smith-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-19T16:06:11.460Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 19, 2025, 12:06 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The big question now is when — and to some extent whether — the Federal Reserve will be able to restart cuts this year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to release their first set of economic projections this year, alongside their interest rate decision, on Wednesday. Those forecasts will offer a fresh glimpse of the trajectory for monetary policy at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/business/economy-inflation-fed-trump.html" title="">highly uncertain moment</a> for the central bank.</p><p>Policymakers paused interest rate cuts in January after reducing borrowing costs by a percentage point in the latter half of last year. They are expected to again stand pat on Wednesday as they await greater clarity on how far President Trump will push his global trade war and to what extent he will follow through on other central aspects of his agenda, including slashing government spending and deporting migrants.</p><div><p>The big question now is when — and to some extent whether — the Fed will be able to restart cuts this year.</p><p>When the Fed last released quarterly economic projections in December, officials penciled in two rate cuts that would reduce borrowing costs by half a percentage point in 2025. But economists now expect Mr. Trump’s policies to lead to more intense price pressures and slower growth, a tough dynamic for the central bank and one that could prompt policymakers to scale back how many cuts they project going forward.</p><p>Here’s what could change and how to interpret those updates.</p><h3 id="link-2372a189"><span>The dot plot, decoded</span></h3><p>When the central bank releases its <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220615.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Summary of Economic Projections</a> each quarter, Fed watchers focus on one part in particular: the dot plot.</p><p>The dot plot will show Fed policymakers’ estimates for interest rates through 2027 and over the longer run. The forecasts are represented by dots arranged along a vertical scale — one dot for each of the central bank’s 19 officials.</p><p>Economists closely watch how the dots are shifting, because that can give a hint about where policy is heading. They fixate most intently on the middle, or median, dot. That is regularly quoted as the clearest estimate of where the central bank sees interest rates going over a given time period.</p><p>The central bank is trying to achieve two things when it sets policy: low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.</p><p>When it perceives elevated inflation to be a concern, it raises interest rates to make borrowing money more expensive, which cools the economy. By taking steam out of the housing and labor markets — as it did between March 2022 and July 2023 — higher rates helped to weaken demand and made it harder for companies to raise prices without losing customers, eventually weighing on inflation.</p><p>With inflation more in check, officials began cutting rates in September, kicking off with a big half-percentage-point reduction. At the time, the Fed’s chair, Jerome H. Powell, billed it as a move that would help to safeguard a strong economy, rather than a panicky response to unexpected weakness. The Fed lowered interest rates twice more in 2024, bringing them down to the current level of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent.</p><p>Based on shifting perceptions about the risks around inflation and growth, economists broadly expect officials to pencil in either one or two quarter-point cuts for this year.</p><h3 id="link-2d8fe2b6"><span>Are interest rates still restrictive?</span></h3><p>When reading the dot plot, it’s important to pay attention to where interest rate estimates fall in relation to the longer-run median projection. That number is sometimes called the “natural” or “neutral” rate. It represents the theoretical dividing line between monetary policy that is set to speed up the economy versus a policy meant to slow it down.</p><p>The neutral estimate has steadily ticked higher in the past year and in December stood at 3 percent.</p><p>At the last meeting, Mr. Powell described rates at their current level as “meaningfully restrictive,” suggesting the Fed sees its policy settings as continuing to weigh on the economy and helping to bring down inflation. Economists will be watching whether the chair changes his tune on that point. If he suggests that rates are no longer as restrictive, it could mean the Fed now sees less capacity to lower rates with inflation still too high.</p><h3 id="link-63e154fa"><span>Inflation concerns resurface</span></h3><p>Price pressures have eased significantly since peaking in 2022, but inflation overall has yet to return to the Fed’s 2 percent target. Progress toward that goal has been very bumpy in recent months, and with Mr. Trump seemingly committed to an aggressive tariff regime, there is increased concern about this progress could get thrown even further off course.</p><p>Fed officials moved their estimates for inflation sharply higher in December, with some already starting to layer in assumptions about what to expect from another Trump administration at that point. Back then, the majority expected the core personal consumption expenditures price index — which strips out volatile food and energy items and is the Fed’s preferred gauge — to hover at 2.8 percent by the end of the year. As of January, it stood at 2.6 percent.</p><p>Policymakers could raise those estimates again on Wednesday given the scope and scale of Mr. Trump’s plans to date.</p><p>Economists and policymakers broadly agree that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, but whether those increases lead to persistently higher inflation is not entirely clear. Much will depend on how extensive the tariffs end up being, how long they are kept in place and ultimately how businesses and consumers respond.</p><h3 id="link-41692b11"><span>Is the soft landing at risk?</span></h3><p>As much as economists and policymakers are worried about resurgent inflation, they are also concerned about growth, despite the labor market having been much more resilient than expected despite soaring inflation and elevated interest rates.</p><p>In December, Fed officials expected the economy to grow 2.1 percent this year, a more moderate pace than 2024 but still a healthy clip. They also expected the unemployment rate to steady around 4.3 percent, 0.2 percentage point higher than its level as of February.</p><p>Estimates pertaining to growth are likely to be lowered in the latest set of projections, while unemployment forecasts could rise as officials factor in Mr. Trump’s plans to cull the federal work force and cut spending more broadly.</p><p>Americans’ feelings about the economy have already significantly soured on fears that all of the uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump’s trade policy will also lead businesses to halt investment and hiring. Still, most economists do not expect a recession, given the economy’s strong foundation.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRjYjBhOWU5LTMwMGYtNWE3OS04MDcyLWQxNWFkY2U4ZTUyNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/business/fed-interest-rates#federal-reserve-economy-projections" data-source-id="100000010058415"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison"><img alt="Joe Rennison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/reader-center/author-joe-rennison/author-joe-rennison-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-19T09:02:27.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 19, 2025, 5:02 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariff negotiations could end up giving the stock market a lift. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The stock market has fallen fast over the past month.

</div></section></div><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently suggested that earlier proposals by the government to introduce hard-line tariffs on trading partners were likely to be softened as negotiations progressed, and that this could offer a tailwind for the stock market.</p><p>Investors are squarely focused on whether the economy can withstand the current period of fading growth expectations and rising recession worries, at least until more business-friendly policies like tax cuts and deregulation are settled on and there is more certainty around tariffs.</p><p>At the beginning of March, investors expected the Fed to next cut interest rates in June, based on prices in interest rate futures markets. As of Tuesday, those expectations had been pushed back six weeks to July.</p><p>But certain interest rates have started to come down even without Fed action. As growth worries have mounted, longer-dated market interest rates have fallen, making things like mortgages and auto loans cheaper.</p><p>In effect, this decline is doing some of the same job that the Fed’s cutting interest rates would do and is buying the central bank some time while inflation remains sticky.</p><p>Lower interest rates are typically seen as being beneficial for the stock market, but the recent decline in rates has not helped lift companies’ share prices</p><p>When rates fall because of fundamental concerns about the economy, the forecast for the companies in the stock market is also gloomy and their valuations typically fall.</p><p>The clouds have been gathering over corporate America. Chief executives from businesses like Delta Air Lines, Dollar General and Macy’s are warning that consumers have begun to struggle.</p><p>And retail sales in February were lower than expected, with January’s preliminary figure revised down in the latest data.</p><p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s growth forecast for the first quarter is currently minus 2.4 percent.</p><p>The U.S. dollar is 4 percent lower just in March, on course for its worst month since November 2022.
