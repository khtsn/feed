Trump is seeking to delay his criminal sentencing in Manhattan until after the presidential election, imploring the judge overseeing the case to allow him additional time to challenge his conviction.</p><p>In a letter to the judge that was made public on Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, noted that his sentencing was currently set for Sept. 18, just weeks before Election Day. The lawyers argued that the timing could improperly influence voters and compromise Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse his conviction on charges that he falsified records to cover up a sex scandal.</p><p>“Sentencing is currently scheduled to occur after the commencement of early voting in the presidential election,” the lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, wrote. “By adjourning the sentencing until after that election — which is of paramount importance to the entire nation,” they added, “the court would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of any future proceedings.”</p><p>Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/16/nyregion/donald-trump-trial-delay-strategy.html" title="">who has routinely sought delays</a> in his four criminal cases, wants to use the extra time to fight his conviction, an effort that hinges on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling granting him broad immunity for official actions as president.</p></div></div><div><div><p>His lawyers cited that decision in their request that the judge, Justice Juan M. Merchan, overturn the verdict and throw out the charges. Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which brought the case, noted in response that it had nothing to do with Mr. Trump’s official acts in the White House.</p><p>Justice Merchan is weighing Mr. Trump’s immunity bid, and has said he will rule on Sept. 16, two days before the sentencing. Mr. Trump faces up to four years in prison, though the judge could impose a shorter sentence or only probation.</p><p>In the new letter to the judge, Mr. Trump’s lawyers argued that the two-day window between the immunity ruling and the sentencing was too short.</p><p>They argued that the sentencing should be postponed to “allow President Trump adequate time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options in response to any adverse ruling,” implying that they might seek to appeal the ruling, as expected, or even take action against Justice Merchan in federal court.</p><p>They also noted that if the sentencing proceeded as planned, prosecutors would be required to file their recommendation for Mr. Trump’s punishment before Justice Merchan rules on the immunity issue.</p></div></div><div><div><p>That timeline, they said, could be “personally and politically prejudicial to President Trump and his family, and harmful to the institution of the presidency.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, declined to comment, and it is unclear how he will respond to Mr. Trump’s request for a delayed sentencing. Mr. Bragg’s office could reply to the letter in the coming days, and if it did not oppose Mr. Trump’s request, the judge might promptly approve a delay.</p><p>Any delay might be relatively brief. Whether or not Mr. Trump wins the election in November, Justice Merchan could still impose his sentence during the presidential transition later this year. If Mr. Trump does win, however, the judge could postpone any punishment until after his term in office expires. If the judge does not sentence him before his inauguration, the case would almost certainly grind to a halt.</p><p>Even if he were re-elected president, Mr. Trump could not pardon himself in Manhattan. The presidential pardon authority does not extend to state cases.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s effort to postpone his sentencing comes as the presidential race has heated up — and tightened — in recent weeks. After President Biden stepped aside, Vice President Kamala Harris’s entry into the race alarmed the Trump campaign, which has seen its lead essentially evaporate.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Still, seeking a delay is hardly new for Mr. Trump. The former president made several attempts to push back his Manhattan trial, and has sought to do the same with the sentencing.</p><p>This spring, his lawyers requested that the trial be postponed after the disclosure of a batch of evidence from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. The defense asked for 90 days; Justice Merchan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/nyregion/trump-bragg-trial-date-delay.html" title="">granted a three-week delay</a>, moving the start of the trial from late March to mid-April.</p><p>The former president was also originally scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, but his lawyers asked that the sentencing be delayed so the judge could consider whether the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity imperiled Mr. Trump’s conviction. When prosecutors did not oppose their request, Justice Merchan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/nyregion/trump-sentencing-hush-money-trial.html" title="">moved the sentencing to Sept. 18</a>.</p><p>During the trial, Justice Merchan made it clear that it was a priority for him to keep the proceeding on track, even as Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized him and his family.</p><p>After a seven-week trial, a jury of 12 New Yorkers convicted Mr. Trump on all 34 felony counts he faced, concluding that he had falsified records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the final days of the 2016 campaign.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The conviction centered on Mr. Trump’s cover-up of the hush-money deal. After his fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual liaison with Mr. Trump, he repaid Mr. Cohen and approved plans to lie on paperwork to hide the nature of the reimbursement, the jury found.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s latest request for a delay comes the same week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/nyregion/trump-trial-merchan-recusal.html" title="">Justice Merchan again declined to step aside from the case</a>. It was Mr. Trump’s third attempt to remove the judge, who the former president claims is biased against him.</p><p>“Stated plainly, defendant’s arguments are nothing more than a repetition of stale and unsubstantiated claims,” Justice Merchan wrote in his latest ruling.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Protess is an investigative reporter at The Times, writing about public corruption.
