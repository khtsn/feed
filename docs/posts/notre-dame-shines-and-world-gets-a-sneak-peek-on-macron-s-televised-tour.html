It will put the spotlight on a bet that he made, and that appears to have paid off, to rebuild the cathedral on a tight five-year deadline.</p><p>“You’ve achieved what was said to be impossible,” Mr. Macron told an assembly of over half of the 2,000 workers and craftsmen from around France — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/world/europe/notre-dame-restoration-carpenter.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">and beyond</a> — who contributed to the cathedral’s reconstruction.</p><p>Representatives for the fund-raising foundations and some of the major sponsors that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/world/europe/donate-notre-dame-fire.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">helped raise</a> nearly $900 million to restore the monument also gathered to hear Mr. Macron speak.</p><p>In the cathedral’s central nave, Mr. Macron said the reopening next week would be “a jolt of hope.” He praised the craftsmanship during a speech that was at times emotional, including when he paid tribute to Jean-Louis Georgelin, the French general who was in charge of the restoration project <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/world/europe/jean-louis-georgelin-dead.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">until he died last year</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29notredame-2-kwhg/29notredame-2-kwhg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29notredame-2-kwhg/29notredame-2-kwhg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29notredame-2-kwhg/29notredame-2-kwhg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An intricate hallway with arches." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29notredame-2-kwhg/29notredame-2-kwhg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29notredame-2-kwhg/29notredame-2-kwhg-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29notredame-2-kwhg/29notredame-2-kwhg-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/multimedia/29notredame-2-kwhg/29notredame-2-kwhg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9aca3022-2b63-51ff-a1e6-4ed9710e06c6" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The view of the nave of the newly refurbished cathedral.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Sarah Meyssonnier</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The cathedral’s spire, a 19th-century addition, crashed through the vaults and slammed charred debris into the ground below. The cathedral was drenched in water used by firefighters to stop the blaze. Gables were threatening to topple.</p><p>“The damage was indeed considerable,” Philippe Villeneuve, the chief architect in charge of Notre-Dame’s reconstruction, told Mr. Macron as he showed him before and after pictures of the cathedral’s interior. But the rest of the monument, like the great organ and the iconic stained glass windows, were “miraculously protected,” Mr. Villeneuve said.</p><p>“There was hope,” he added. “That’s when I thought that the five-year deadline — which was an obsession for all of us from the beginning — seemed feasible to me.”</p><p>The cathedral will reopen during an official ceremony, broadcast to the world and attended by foreign officials, followed by a string of Masses, concerts and other events. About 15 million yearly visitors are expected at Notre-Dame, which was already among the world’s most visited monuments before the fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The investigation into the cause of the 2019 blaze is continuing, but a definitive cause may never be determined. The leading theories among investigators are that it was sparked by an electrical short-circuit or a discarded cigarette.</p><p>Mr. Macron started his tour in the plaza in front of the cathedral, which is also in the process of being redesigned to open it up toward the Seine River and to help millions of visitors flow through more easily and comfortably by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/world/europe/notre-dame-cathedral-paris.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">mitigating the effects of climate change</a>.</p><p>Renovation of flying buttresses and other parts of the cathedral’s exterior will continue for several more years, and the cathedral is still spotted with scaffolding.</p><p>Inside, though, the forest of metal tubes that had been erected after the blaze was gone.</p><p>During Mr. Macron’s carefully choreographed, two-hour tour, he saw new liturgical furniture, like the altar; peered at delicately sculpted scenes from the life of Christ; marveled at gold-leaf stars set across a deep blue ceiling in one of the painted side chapels; and looked up at cherubs on the oculus, a ring of stone at the center of the four vaults that form the cathedral’s transept crossing.</p><p>Mr. Macron was also taken up into the new attic and to the base of the new spire. Like the rest of the cathedral, both were rebuilt so that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/europe/Notre-Dame-spire-Macron.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">they are nearly identical to the pre-fire structure</a>, using over 2,000 oak trees from around France.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Each piece is unique, and each piece is made with one tree,” Jean-Louis Bidet, the technical director of Ateliers Perrault, the company that built the choir roofing, told Mr. Macron as he showed him beams that were hewed by hand, like in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Mr. Bidet and other craftsmen showed Mr. Macron some tools — a stone chisel, an ax, a plumb line — to highlight the ancestral techniques that they used to renovate the cathedral, along with modern engineering know-how. In his speech, Mr. Macron said that each worker was a “link” in a chain of skills that stretches back to the Middle Ages.</p><p>“Our nation’s gratitude is immense,” Mr. Macron said, before thanking them again.</p><p>The workers, clustered on the cathedral’s black-and-white checkered flooring, burst into applause.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
