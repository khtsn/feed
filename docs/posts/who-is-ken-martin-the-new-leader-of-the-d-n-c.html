Nixon carried the state in 1972.</p><p>But Mr. Martin, who got his start in politics as an intern on Paul Wellstone’s 1990 Senate campaign — and became a disciple of the Democrat’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/11/us/the-1990-elections-minnesota-professor-s-everyman-appeal-wins-a-senate-seat.html" title="">emphasis on grass-roots organizing</a> — has navigated many competitive races up and down the ballot.</p><p>He encountered a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/elections/2010/results/minnesota.html" title="">beleaguered</a> <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2011/12/30/dfl-in-the-red-too" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organization in debt</a> when he assumed the chairmanship of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, as the state party is formally known, and is credited with turning its fortunes around.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“He gets a lot of credit, not only for that, but for keeping it going the long haul, even in elections where not as many seats are on the ballot,” Ms. Klobuchar said. </p><p>During his tenure, his party has not lost a statewide race, his team notes, though the elections last fall were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/after-loss-tim-walz-faces-partys-sinking-fortunes-in-minnesota.html" title="">challenging for Democrats in Minnesota</a> and across the country.</p><p>He also has experience holding together a fractious coalition that spans the ideological spectrum, from deeply progressive activists in the Twin Cities to at least some moderate voters in rural parts of the state.</p><p>“It’s hard to knock what he’s done” from a tactical standpoint, said Amy Koch, the former Republican majority leader in the Minnesota State Senate. “He’s been able to keep a really divergent coalition of Democrats together.”</p><p>He will have his work cut out for him on the national stage, where Democrats are divided over what went wrong in 2024, how to fix their party — and how deep their problems run.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p><h2 id="link-42fb8656">He’s more behind-the-scenes strategist than flashy party spokesman.</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Martin took charge of the beleaguered, and deep in debt, state party in 2011, and is credited for turning it around.

When he appeared on “The Daily Show” and began to speak passionately about what he saw as injustice, Jon Stewart, the host, couldn’t stop interrupting him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Oh, my God,” Mr. Stewart <a href="https://x.com/benwikler/status/1884438993472782636" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interjected at one point</a>. “I’m getting excited.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Martin has plenty of experience speaking with the news media. And during the Detroit forum, he alluded to another role he might try to play as chairman: attack dog.</p><p>In Minnesota, he said, he saw his job as seeking to define the Republicans, an effort to free up Democratic candidates to “take the high road.”</p><p>“I will throw the punches so they don’t have to, and we will go on the offense against Donald Trump,” he said. “That’s the role that I will play as spokesperson.”</p><p>And, he promised, “I will also be the organizer in chief.”</p><h2 id="link-25cade0b">His win was not about ideology.</h2><p>Sometimes, races for state and national chair positions offer revealing insights about the ideological direction in which a party is heading, or serve as proxy fights in broader clashes between activists and the establishment.</p><p>Not so in this year’s race.</p><p>While Mr. Martin calls himself a “pro-labor progressive” and cites the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/opinion/tim-walz-paul-wellstone.html" title="">populist Mr. Wellstone</a> as <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/ken-martin-dnc-chair-interview/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an inspiration</a>, he and Mr. Wikler both promised a “big tent” approach and drew endorsements from both left-leaning and more moderate officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>And Mr. Martin has cast himself as a pragmatist focused above all on winning.</p><p>“I’m not here to win the argument,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJhsEKPU-js" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said recently</a> on MSNBC. “I’m here to win elections.”</p><p>The purpose of a political party, he added, is “to build the infrastructure to not only win the upcoming election but to build long-term power.”</p><p>Reid J.
