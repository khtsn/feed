The situation in the country is just as tenuous now as it was when Lincoln spoke those words, and the opponents of equality and progress are just as strident.</p><p>Harris has come into that doom circle not selling Obama-era hope but a close cousin of it: joy. She is directing her campaign to the half of an electorate traumatized by Donald Trump and dreading the possibility of his return.</p><p>Harris is selling joy as an antidote to despair. She is selling optimism to Democrats who had fallen so deeply into a depression, and for so long that they could no longer fully appreciate the magnitude of their own sorrow.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Hope is an investment in the future; joy is a payout in the now.</p><p>Many of us will never forget what Obama meant to the country, how important and transformative his presidency was, not just in policy but as a radical alteration of the image of power, efficacy and excellence.</p><p>But the Obama era existed in a moment in time, and it cannot be recalled at will, no matter how much he and others may wish it so. This is a new day, a new era, a Kamala Harris era, and she was meant for her own moment on her own terms.</p><p>In this era, it’s not so much about the audacity of hope as it is about a radical insistence on joy.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Charles M.
