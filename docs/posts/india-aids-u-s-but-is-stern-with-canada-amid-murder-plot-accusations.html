Jaishankar, India’s minister of external affairs, called the Canadian accusations “egregious,” and Indian officials suggested that Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was motivated by domestic politics. When Mr. Trudeau testified before a Canadian committee that the accusations were based on intelligence rather than “evidentiary proof,” many Indians considered it a “gotcha” moment.</p><p>“The point that they need to understand, it’s no longer a world that runs as a one-way street,” Mr. Jaishankar told reporters in May. “Newton’s Law of politics will apply,” he said — every action has an equal and opposition reaction, especially from an India prepared to show a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/asia/justin-trudeau-accusations-india-intelligence-agencies.html" title="">more muscular stance</a> geopolitically.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Detailed accusations provided by the U.S. Justice Department on Thursday build on last year’s case. At the time, federal prosecutors accused an unnamed Indian intelligence official of orchestrating a plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh nationalist who is a citizen of the United States and Canada. India considers Mr. Pannun, the lawyer for a group called Sikhs for Justice, a terrorist.</p><p>In the latest set of accusations, American officials identify the intelligence official as Vikash Yadav, an employee of India’s external intelligence agency. The U.S. charges unveiled this week also contain references to the Sikh activist killed last year in British Columbia. That attack, on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/world/canada/who-is-hardeep-singh-nijjar-india.html" title="">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Canadian citizen, in June 2023 set off the fracas between Canada and India that worsened this week.</p><p>Indian officials said on Thursday that Mr. Yadav, the intelligence official, was no longer a government employee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Flags and banners at the Sikh place of worship in Surrey, British Columbia, where a prominent Sikh cleric, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was ambushed and killed last year. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jackie Dives for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In both cases, India is likely to face increased pressure to explain its actions. Canada and the United States are members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, which also includes Australia, Britain and New Zealand. Mr. Trudeau said that Canada had shared the intelligence it gathered on Mr. Nijjar’s killing with the Five Eyes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This week, the United States backed Canada’s accusations, and Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, urged India to take the accusations “extremely” seriously.</p><p>“We wanted to see the government of India cooperate with Canada in its investigation,” Mr. Miller said during a news conference. “Obviously, they have not chosen that path.”</p><p>Hari Kumar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
