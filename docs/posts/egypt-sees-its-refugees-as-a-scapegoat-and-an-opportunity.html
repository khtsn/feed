Is that acceptable? After we opened our country for them?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Egypt long made it easy for foreigners of all kinds to live and work in the country, largely without interference, whether they were refugees, migrant workers or Westerners escaping coronavirus lockdowns.</p><p>The past 13 years have brought a near unbroken stream of newcomers fleeing conflict to the country that is known among Arabs as the “mother of the world.” That includes not just Syrians but also Sudanese, Yemenis, Eritreans and, most recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/world/middleeast/gaza-egypt-palestinians.html" title="">Palestinians from Gaza</a>.</p><p>Egypt’s lax immigration rules meant many never formally registered as refugees or received official permission to stay long-term, yet managed to stitch themselves almost seamlessly into the country, supporting themselves and sometimes starting businesses.</p><p>Since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/sudan-khartoum-military.html" title="">Sudan’s civil war</a> drove a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/world/middleeast/sudan-refugees-egypt.html" title="">surge of refugees</a> to Egypt starting in 2023, however, the impoverished government in Cairo has complained louder and louder about the burden of foreigners. It rapidly tightened its policies — hoping, analysts and diplomats say, to win more support from international backers eager to prevent migration to their own countries.</p><p>Egypt says it spends $10 billion each year on its nine million refugees, according to officials and government-controlled media (though experts say both numbers are greatly exaggerated), all while Egyptians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/world/middleeast/egypt-economic-crisis-gold-price.html" title="">endure soaring prices</a> and subsidy cuts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Years of government overspending, reliance on imports and policies that neglected private-sector growth left the country’s finances in precarious shape before the wars in Ukraine and Gaza sent them crashing.

The president accused them of draining Egypt’s precious water. On social media, pro-government accounts — some of which appeared to be fake — accused Sudanese refugees of driving up rents and promoting female genital mutilation.</p><p>A crackdown soon followed the accusations, according to migrants, refugees and their advocates.</p><p>Sudanese refugees have been <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/06/egypt-authorities-must-end-campaign-of-mass-arrests-and-forced-returns-of-sudanese-refugees/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rounded up</a> in police sweeps, detained and summarily deported. Syrians who have lived in Egypt for years have been told to pay thousands of dollars to stay. Many remain hesitant to return, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">the fall of the Assad regime</a> in December, until the situation stabilizes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Foreign workers from Asia and from other parts of Africa now <a href="https://www.madamasr.com/en/2024/06/30/feature/politics/pay-1000-register-as-a-refugee-or-face-deportation-egypts-undocumented-migrants-confront-difficult-choice-as-deadline-looms/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">face extra hurdles</a> to keep their legal status, and in some cases, have been arrested to compel them to pay high fees, advocates say.</p><p>Last month, Egypt passed a law that would hand responsibility for screening refugees and others to the government, instead of to the United Nations refugee agency.</p><p>Government officials said the measure would ensure a wide array of refugee rights. Critics of the move, however, said that it would become <a href="https://eipr.org/en/press/2024/11/22-ngos-joint-statement-grave-risks-posed-passing-proposed-foreign-asylum-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">far harder</a> for refugees to gain protection or access to health care and schools. The law also empowers the government to revoke refugee status on vague grounds such as breaches of national security, political activity or violations of Egyptian social customs.</p><p>Abu Saleh, 32, a Syrian who works in a small Cairo grocery, said he had lived in the city for 13 years “without a single issue” until he discovered in July that he could no longer enroll his son in school without a residence permit.</p><p>Just to renew his family’s tourist visas, he said, he was told that he would have to return to Syria and pay $2,000 per person in fees — a process he would have to repeat every six months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“Egypt has been there for us all along,” said Abu Saleh, who asked to be identified by the name he uses around town to avoid possible repercussions. “I’d like to appeal to the government of Egypt: Give us residence, even if it’s a little more expensive. We’re facing tough conditions.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sudanese teenagers in Giza, Egypt, in September. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Heba Khamis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Egypt has not explained its hardening attitude toward foreigners. But analysts and migrant advocates tie it to the economic crisis, which has generated widespread bitterness and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/world/middleeast/egypt-election-sisi.html" title="">undermined President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s rule</a>.</p><p>The newcomers make convenient scapegoats for Egyptians’ hardships, rights groups say. Immigration fees, charged in dollars, can supply some of the foreign currency that Egypt badly needs. And foreigners are also valuable pawns in Egypt’s quest for more financial support from its international partners, rights groups say.</p><p>“They think, ‘How can these people be useful for the government?’” said Nour Khalil, executive director of the Refugees Platform in Egypt, which advocates migrants’ rights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The U.N. refugee agency <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/eg/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2024/11/Registered-Population-Refugees-and-Asylum-Seekers-as-of-31-October.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">counts about 818,000 registered refugees</a> in Egypt, who are entitled to free public health care and education. There are likely many more unregistered refugees, though analysts and aid workers dispute the figure reaches nine million.</p><p>The benefits that registered refugees receive mean that Egypt “is treating them like Egyptians, despite the fact that we are not a rich country,” the foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said at a news conference last month. “There is no country in the world assuming these responsibilities and challenges like here in Egypt. We don’t have one single refugee camp — they are fully integrated in society.”</p><p>Refugee advocates agree that Egypt needs more resources. Unlike other countries in the region, including Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, where the United States, the United Nations and the European Union have poured billions into supporting refugees, Egypt has not received significant funds to help house Syrian or other refugees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group of Sudanese boys playing soccer in Cairo in September. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Heba Khamis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>That is changing.</p><p>As the war in Gaza has pounded Egypt’s finances, Western backers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/egypt-election-gaza-war.html" title="">rushed to Egypt’s aid</a>, anxious to prevent an economic collapse in the Arab world’s most populous country, analysts and diplomats say.
