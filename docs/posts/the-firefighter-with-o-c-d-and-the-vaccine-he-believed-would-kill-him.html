Of all his idiosyncrasies, and there were lots, this was among the most rational.</p><p>A small sampling of the others: He brought his own sheets and pillowcase for overnights at the firehouse. He wiped down everything with his own stash of bleach wipes — including the inside of the fire engine. In his back pocket, he had a second remote control for the fire station’s TV, so he wouldn’t need to touch the shared one.</p><p>Unlike the other men in the company, he walked to work from his tidy little house on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens: a lone figure in a dark blue F.D.N.Y. uniform on a two-mile trek, along the empty beach and through vast parking lots. Firefighters waiting for the shift change would watch from the kitchen window and take turns announcing his approach: <em>Here comes Reen, he’s trudging along, getting closer now.</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>What Engine Company 329 never saw was the ritual that Firefighter Reen performed after his shift.

His uniform went in a trash bag at the basement door. He’d put on a pair of shorts and a single latex glove, which allowed him to open the door without contaminating the house. Then he’d go straight to the shower, working his way through most of a bar of pink Dove soap.</p><p>For as long as he can remember, Timmy Reen has been governed by obsessions and compulsions. Most revolve around ideas of contamination. In his mind, any place outside his home that he cannot control — a restaurant, a crowded store, the firehouse — is contaminated. He has what his psychiatrist, Dr. Emma Laskin, called in an affidavit “one of the most severe cases of O.C.D.,” obsessive-compulsive disorder, she had ever seen.</p><p>The firefighter with severe O.C.D. could well be a unique medical case study: a man with a worsening disorder working in a high-stakes and unpredictable environment that is completely ill-suited to his compulsions.</p><p>Yet for 20 years he performed honorably and found great pride in being part of the Fire Department. He was a big, strong guy from a family of firefighters, and if some of the guys at the firehouse thought he was an oddball, they also viewed him as dependable. No matter the emergency, he responded with the rest of the company.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>And he might still be fighting fires with Engine Company 329 if not for Covid-19.</p><p>Or, more precisely, if not for the Covid vaccine — an unbearable contamination that forced Firefighter Reen’s secret into the open and cost him his career.</p><p>“You know,” he said recently, “it probably was not the best profession that I could get into as a person who has severe O.C.D.”</p><h2 id="link-69aab868">Early Signs</h2><p>The Fire Department exerts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/us/sept-11-reckoning/queens.html" title="">a tidal pull over the Rockaways</a>, where generations of Reens have lived. Timmy Reen’s dad was a firefighter, and so were three of his uncles. The odds were always high that Timmy would grow up to be a firefighter. But he also knew he would struggle.</p><p>He recalls a family trip to Florida in the 1970s. In the back seat, Timmy, age 6, watched the passing trucks. An eighteen-wheeler was supposed to have 18 wheels. But each truck flew by too fast for an accurate count. He became frantic. He needed to count them, or something terrible would happen. His dad, up front, would grow frustrated and command, “Sit still.” A thousand miles of this.</p><p>It’s his first memory of what he would later learn was called obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p>Fussy or fastidious people might say they are “a little O.C.D.” But clinical O.C.D. can be a debilitating, isolating disorder, affecting <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">perhaps 2 percent of American adults</a>. It is defined by persistent and unwanted thoughts or urges, followed by compulsions — often performed to counteract the thoughts and urges. For some, the disorder revolves around the need to check and recheck certain objects — and the dread that something horrible will happen if they don’t. Others suffer from intrusive thoughts, typically taboo or violent. Some, like Mr. Reen, obsess over fears of contamination that they know are irrational.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Dr. Helen Blair Simpson, a psychiatry professor and O.C.D. researcher at Columbia University, recalled one patient who came to feel that an entire city in another state was contaminated. Mail originating in that city would contaminate the patient’s home if brought inside. An atlas of the United States had, by depicting that city, contaminated the room in the patient’s apartment where it sat on a bookshelf.</p><p>“For some people, the anxiety stays specific, but in others it can generalize,” Dr. Simpson said. And it can keep spreading until it takes over a person’s life.</p><h2 id="link-563f4d30">“It Was Evil, It Was Demonic”</h2><p>Mr. Reen’s childhood home was four houses down from the Rockaway shuttle, a spur of the A train that ran across the peninsula. His bedroom window faced the elevated tracks. Whenever he heard the approaching roar and clatter, he would look up and count the train cars. Sometimes it was four, sometimes six.</p><p>In those days, the train was just part of the scenery. Today it is the central preoccupation of his life.</p><p>“Probably my No. 1 scariest thing that sets me into a frenzy is the New York City subway,” Mr. Reen said. “The subway has controlled and dictated my life.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Rockaway shuttle, a spur of the A train line, passed right by the childhood home of Mr. Reen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As a child living at the edge of the city, Mr. Reen rarely rode the subway. But one of his first jobs after high school sent him underground to put up advertisements in trains and on subway platforms. Until then, his obsessions and compulsions had mainly involved counting and repetitious behavior. But that was changing, and his time in the subway proved a catalyst.</p><p>He found himself in pervasive, subterranean dirtiness — pipes, standing water, metal dust spewed from the friction of wheels on rails. “It was contaminated,” he said. “It was evil, it was demonic.”</p><p>After quitting that job, Mr. Reen spent his 20s working for the Parks Department and managing a health club. He had married his high school crush and before long he was a father of four. He wanted to join the Fire Department, but he was initially stymied by the written test, blaming his obsessive need to read most things precisely three times.</p><p>Then, in July 2002, at the age of 32, he was finally hired by the Fire Department, part of a wave of recruits to bolster a force decimated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He was older than the average “probie,” or probational firefighter, but he seemed to fit right in when he was assigned to a large South Brooklyn firehouse. He was friendly and confident, and had acceptable interests: weight lifting, working out and talking sports. Three years into his career, his supervisor rated him as an aggressive firefighter who performed well under emergency conditions and got along with others. “FF Reen is an asset to this unit,” a captain wrote.</p><p>Mr. Reen did his best to hide his symptoms at the firehouse, but his family watched him growing more aloof and rigid. At his sons’ baseball games, he no longer sat in the bleachers. He stood at the left-field foul pole, far from the other parents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighter Reen with his children in less difficult times.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Timmy Reen </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Reen’s children were aware of their father’s issues. The way he wouldn’t walk down certain blocks, the way he always changed his clothes outside, the way he never let them play with his uniform, unlike other firefighter fathers. And the constant sound of water running through the pipes, as he took his interminable showers.</p><p>To Mr. Reen’s youngest son, Eoin, now in college after five years in the Marine Corps, his father’s relationship to water was a mystery. He knew his dad used to love ocean swimming and surfing, but in his memories of beach days in the Rockaways, his father is almost always on the shore, filming his children boogie-boarding, or playing endless Wiffle ball with them. “I would bug him about it, ‘Come in the water, come in the water,’” he recalled. The response was always the same. Dad stayed on the beach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I don’t know the explanation for why he doesn’t go in,” Eoin said recently. “And I don’t think I’ll ever find out.”</p><h2 id="link-7458c69f">“Total Faith in Tim”</h2><p>Mr. Reen first saw a therapist at 13, and he has tried various medications and long bouts of exposure therapy, which forces patients to confront their triggers and resist their compulsions. But for some people, the success of these interventions can be limited.</p><p>As part of his therapy, Mr. Reen has tried on a few occasions to go home and delay his usual decontamination rituals. But after a few hours, when he finally could tolerate it no longer, he found himself overwhelmed: He needed to do a deep clean of every room he had been in. “Because I tried to be tough, now I’ve got to spend 15 hours, not eating or drinking, just washing everything,” he recalled. Over the years, he stopped trying to resist.</p><p>More than half of O.C.D. patients who receive <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/ocd/treatment/pharma.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">both medication</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796721000899" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and exposure therapy</a> show meaningful improvement. But for those who don’t get better, symptoms sometimes worsen with age. “When O.C.D. has too much time,” Dr. Simpson, the Columbia researcher, said, “it really can run amok.”</p><p>Mr. Reen’s first O.C.D. crisis in the Fire Department came early: a memorial service at Madison Square Garden to honor firefighters who died in the Sept. 11 attacks. He and the rest of his company rode the train together from Brooklyn. “I had to board the subway in my Class A uniform,” he recalled. The uniform — the fancy one with the peaked cap and the metal F.D.N.Y. insignia — was now contaminated, and he stuffed it all into a bag when he got home. A few years later, unable to clean it to his satisfaction, he simply threw it out. That was the last time he rode the subway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighters attended a 9/11 memorial service at Madison Square Garden for those who died at the World Trade Center.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“I’m as good as being on the subway,” he thought.</p><p>So began the washing of money. With liquid soap and scalding water, wearing rubber gloves. It was so onerous that he stopped accepting $1 bills as change, leaving them on the counter.</p><p>A few years later, he was at the beach, just as he had been a thousand times before. As he watched swimmers and children playing in the surf, a thought emerged. Some of those beachgoers had arrived by the A train. The idea lodged in his mind like a barbed hook: The subway had contaminated the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Apart from his therapist, Mr. Reen never told anyone about the contamination of money or the ocean. Though he felt a constant sense of isolation and shame, he said, it never prevented him from doing his job. He has responded to dozens of fires over his career, he said, and countless other emergencies, including water rescues, and he pulled his weight. In interviews, firefighters who worked with him at Engine 329 said the same.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“I had total faith in Tim,” said Bill Dunigan, who retired from the Fire Department in 2019 and joined Firefighter Reen on a number of emergency runs. “He performed admirably, was in the thick of it and did his job.”</p><p>In interviews, Mr. Reen explained that as a firefighter, when there was a job to do, he simply did it, accepting that he was now “contaminated.” He almost looked forward to it. “Being in a contaminated state is almost a sigh of relief,” he said; it meant there was nothing more to guard against. The worst part came afterward.</p><p>Everything depended on his decontaminating before he returned home, or his entire house would be contaminated. The drive home from the Brooklyn firehouse posed its own problem. It meant that not only was he contaminated, but his car was, too. So after each shift, when he stopped in a parking lot by the ocean to shake out his clothes, he needed to air out his car and run a lint roller over every inch of the interior. “A hideous process,” he recalled.</p><p>Yet the more he cleaned, he said, the more he loathed himself. He should be with his family, not in an empty parking lot. “I know that it’s all nonsense,” he said, referring to his decontamination rituals. “And yet here I am.”</p><p>One solution was to walk to work, so around 2010, he transferred to Engine Company 329 in the Rockaways, just two miles from home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>No matter the weather, Mr. Reen would walk the two miles from his home to Engine Company 329 in the Rockaways.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hilary Swift for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>The firehouse was a pleasant place with a slower tempo: fewer fires, the occasional water rescue when lifeguards were off-duty, a breeze off the ocean. During the summer, families on their way to the beach would stop to let their children admire the fire truck. The firefighters were a close-knit group, with only five guys on each tour. Mr. Reen felt like he had found a home.</p><p>He contrived half-convincing ways to hide his anxieties. Communal meals are an important part of firehouse culture, but he couldn’t bear to watch anyone handle food that he would eat. So on a spaghetti day, for example, he made sure he was the guy rolling the meatballs.</p><p>“Go watch the game,” he’d tell the other guys. “Let me take care of this. It’s a guilty pleasure of mine.”</p><p>Most firefighters were happy to go along.</p><p>“I just thought he was meticulous to a fault,” Mr. Dunigan, the retired colleague, said. “I had no idea.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><h2 id="link-4163eac4">The Ultimate Contamination</h2><p>Mr. Reen had been at Engine Company 329 for nearly a decade when the coronavirus pandemic hit. The prospect of actual viral contamination didn’t worry him much. He regarded himself as robust and healthy. He watched as other people began washing their hands as though their lives depended on it. “I’ve been living Covid protocols for 40 years,” he reflected.</p><p>But when vaccines became available, he felt dread. He grew obsessed with the idea that an injection of this new vaccine could put him in a permanent state of contamination, an unbearable thought.</p><p>In late 2021, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that all New York City workers must be vaccinated. To many firefighters, the mandate felt like an insult. They had worked with little protection during the pandemic’s deadliest phase. Many assumed they must have some natural immunity. Thousands of firefighters — <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/21/nypd-lags-in-vaccinating-cops-as-delta-covid-variant-spreads/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 40 percent of the department</a> — were unvaccinated when the mayor announced the mandate. Was this their reward for serving the city? To be fired if they refused a vaccine?</p><p>By late 2021, close to 2,000 F.D.N.Y. employees had sought a religious or medical exemption, according to legal papers filed by a Fire Department lawyer. Mr. Reen’s request was among them, though his stood out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 2021 protest against Mayor Bill de Blasio’s mandate that city workers be vaccinated against Covid-19.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>“Due to my severe mental illness I am unable to inject anything that stays in my body for a length of time,” he wrote in neat block letters in his request for an exemption. “Doing so,” he concluded, “would result in suicide.”</p><p>His request included letters from past psychiatrists affirming the seriousness of his O.C.D. Like most everyone else’s, his request was denied. He appealed.</p><p>Around the start of 2022, Mr. Reen was summoned to the Fire Department’s headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn. What happened there became the subject of a lawsuit that he would file a year later.</p><p>A department psychiatrist asked if he was suicidal, Mr. Reen’s suit says. Mr. Reen responded, according to court papers, that he was not suicidal. He was fine, he said, so long as the vaccine was not forced on him. A top Fire Department medical officer, Dr. Karen Hurwitz, joined the meeting. “Just get the damn shot; you are not getting an exemption,” she shouted at him, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>When the meeting was over, Mr. Reen said, Dr. Hurwitz had three fire marshals escort him into an ambulance waiting out front. The ambulance took Mr. Reen to a Brooklyn hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Two doctors examined him and concluded that there was no reason to admit him, he said. He was sent home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Dr. Hurwitz did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for the Fire Department declined to comment, citing Mr. Reen’s continuing lawsuit. But at a court hearing in July, a lawyer for the city defended Dr. Hurwitz’s actions, noting that Mr. Reen’s handwritten vaccine exemption request had sparked concern.</p><p>“He wrote he would commit suicide,” the lawyer, Kathleen Linnane, said at the July hearing, “in giant capital letters.”</p><p>“The F.D.N.Y. denied his request and called him to headquarters because they were afraid he had suicidal ideation,” Ms. Linnane said. Dr. Hurwitz, she added, had sent him to the hospital to be evaluated. “The doctor has every right to do that,” Ms. Linnane said.</p><h2 id="link-6fadf6bc">“That Little Life, They Took Away From Me”</h2><p>Among the rank-and-file firefighters, the gossip began to circulate: Timmy Reen from Engine 329 was having some sort of mental crisis.</p><p>When Mr. Reen returned to the firehouse a week or so later, he tried to clear the air. “‘I just want you guys to know you shouldn’t have to worry about me being able to do this job,’” another firefighter recalled Mr. Reen telling the guys.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Reen’s handwritten application for an exemption to the Covid-19 vaccine caused alarm at the Fire Department, a lawyer for the city said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Timmy Reen</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>He continued showing up to work, awaiting the results of his appeal.

For 20 years he had tried to keep his O.C.D. a secret. He had built a stable, if fragile, life for himself. He was, he noted, “a contributing member of society,” no small thing given the severity of his condition. “That little tiny life that I crafted, that I had — that little life, they took away from me.”</p><p>In September 2022, he received a brief email from the Fire Department: His appeal had been denied.

It was easier, he said, to keep his distance.</p><p>Mr. Reen had long had a bedrock conviction that apart from his mental disorder, he was a good man. But today he feels mostly shame, for all the time he devoted to his compulsions instead of to his family. “I wasted a good life,” he reflected, his voice thick with disgust. “I’ve destroyed and ruined a life with this stuff.”</p><p>He still has a few friends who call to check in.
