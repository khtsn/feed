    <h1>Overlooked Stories</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Journalists learned a tough lesson when they began posting articles online: Sometimes, the stories we work hardest on get overlooked.</p><p>Some of the reasons for this are obvious. Maybe a beautifully crafted feature story is overtaken by a major news event. Maybe an investigation uncovers wrongdoing that affects a niche group, such as the customers of a local utility company. Maybe, hoping to see ahead of the curve, we profile a musician we expect to be famous in a year — but that person doesn’t have legions of followers yet.</p><p>Occasionally, this means readers have missed out on a gem. As an editor — someone whose work is often invisible to readers — I don’t mind sharing that this is a source of anguish.</p><p>Every year, The Morning dedicates a newsletter to the stories from across the newsroom that Times editors thought deserved more eyes or ears. We hope you will discover some great journalism below.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Blinky, a Koala in Brisbane, Australia. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.
