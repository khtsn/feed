			<p>Your approach to discussion and analysis often comes across as excessive, and many in the community feel that you overestimate your own insights. While you may be confident in your understanding, that does not necessarily place you above others, including respected figures at the highest levels of competition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must of blacked out from the exhaustion during my moments with VCTEsports Tiktok, Platchat, numerous pro players, semi-pro coaches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your past interactions with platforms like VCTEsports TikTok, Platchat, and various professional and semi-professional players and coaches do not necessarily equate to influence or credibility. Simply being present in those spaces does not mean your contributions were valued or impactful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also I debate for fun and to watch performative displays of people who think they can just HAVE knowledge and for that untested knowledge to be correct. The confidence is awe inspiring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, your own words suggest a contradiction in your perspective. You claim to debate for entertainment and to challenge those who assume knowledge without proper validation. However, by your own logic, what have you personally accomplished to substantiate your views? You acknowledge preferring unconventional strategies over established fundamentals, which is a respectable stance. However, advocating for close-quarters combat (CQB) over core fundamentals in a tactical shooter raises questions about the validity of your approach.</p>
<p>Ultimately, regardless of any success you might achieve, your reputation will be shaped not just by your results but by how you engage with the community and how your ideas align with the broader competitive landscape.</p>		</div></div>
