Most notably there was his hair. Lavishly thick, swooping skyward in a cartoon volute, Mr. Lynch’s coiffure, a virile cockscomb, was like Alfred Hitchcock’s profile or John Ford’s eye patch — inherently caricatural and so distinctive that it all but merited a ZIP code.</p><p>The hair, though, was just one aspect of a sharply etched visual persona all the more potent because it was composed of basic elements. And cigarettes.</p><p>Intrinsic to Mr. Lynch’s persona were the smokes he took up in childhood (in some interviews, he claimed to have picked up the habit at age 8), which may have contributed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/movies/david-lynch-dead.html" title="">his death on Thursday at 78</a>. He seemed to have been born searching for an ashtray.</p><p>Cigarettes are almost unsurpassed among lethal props in the appeal they have exerted throughout cinematic history, yet few directors have treated them as rapturously onscreen as Mr. Lynch did, or have been more severely addicted to them in real life. Even after being diagnosed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/arts/television/david-lynch-emphysema-twin-peaks.html" title="">emphysema</a> in 2020, Mr. Lynch failed to give them up, as People noted <a href="https://people.com/david-lynch-smoking-at-age-8-now-he-needs-oxygen-copd-exclusive-8743594" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a 2024 interview</a> with him. “I saw the writing on the wall and it said, ‘You’re going to die in a week if you don’t stop,’” Mr. Lynch told the publication in November.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>While he did eventually stop, by then it was too late: Homebound and unable to work on set, Mr. Lynch by then could barely walk across a room.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/multimedia/17DAVID-LYNCH-STYLE-03-bzjm/17DAVID-LYNCH-STYLE-03-bzjm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/multimedia/17DAVID-LYNCH-STYLE-03-bzjm/17DAVID-LYNCH-STYLE-03-bzjm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/multimedia/17DAVID-LYNCH-STYLE-03-bzjm/17DAVID-LYNCH-STYLE-03-bzjm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="David Lynch sitting on a chair.
