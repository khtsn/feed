She said she hoped the outcome would send a message to victims of sexual assault to “speak up.”</p><p>“You have a voice,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2024/nov/22/nikita-hand-gives-statement-after-winning-trial-against-conor-mcgregor-video" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said.</a></p><p>The allegations have dogged Mr. McGregor, a star fighter known as Notorious who has been credited with helping to popularize mixed martial arts and the Ultimate Fighting Championship, or U.F.C., and who remains a major figure among fans even though it has been three years since his last fight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A hardscrabble Irishman with a foul mouth and his own name tattooed across his ribs, Mr. McGregor became famous globally not only for his feats in the octagon, but also for his back story and his frequent violent outbursts.</p><p>Not long before rising to become one of the U.F.C.’s most recognized names, he was destitute and living with his mother.</p><p>On Friday, he put his head in his hands after the jury returned its verdict, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/mma-fighter-conor-mcgregor-assaulted-woman-at-dublin-hotel-jury-finds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to news reports</a>. He <a href="https://x.com/TheNotoriousMMA/status/1860021386825085173" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said later on social media</a> that he was “disappointed that the jury did not hear all the evidence” and that he planned to appeal the decision.</p><p>“I am with my family now, focused on my future,” he said, and thanked his fans.</p><p>His lawyer, Remy Farrell, could not immediately be reached for comment. In his closing statement, he asked the jurors to overlook whatever feelings they may have about Mr. McGregor and to focus on the evidence.</p><p>In his prime, Mr. McGregor frequently took to social media to show off the lifestyle he had gained access to with his newfound wealth. It was during that period that he met Ms. Hand, who comes from the same part of Dublin as Mr. McGregor, according to her lawsuit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the early hours of Dec. 9, 2018, after Mr. McGregor and Ms Hand exchanged messages on Instagram, a driver picked up Ms. Hand and a colleague from a holiday party and drove them to the Beacon Hotel in Dublin. On the way, Ms. Hand consumed some cocaine, her lawsuit said. (During the trial, jurors were told that Mr. McGregor had taken cocaine, too.)</p><p>Once in the penthouse suite, Mr. McGregor “beckoned” her to the bedroom, according to the lawsuit, and then began kissing her and removing her clothes. When she tried to fend him off, he put her in a chokehold three times, after which she ceased resisting, the lawsuit said. Mr. McGregor then raped her, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Ms. Hand said a second man, James Lawrence, later sexually assaulted her in the same suite. The jury found Mr. Lawrence not liable for assault. </p><p>After Ms. Hand went home, her mother called her an ambulance and she was examined at a sexual assault treatment unit at a hospital. A physician who <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2024/1122/1482479-key-moments-mcgregor-case/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">testified</a> during the trial said she had a tampon “wedged” at the very top of her vagina and bruising on all four limbs and other parts of her body.</p><p>A month later, she went to the police and reported that she had been raped.</p><p>During the trial, Mr. McGregor’s lawyers said he and Ms. Hand had vigorous sex, but the lawyers said it was consensual, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/conor-mcgregor-rape-civil-trial-lawsuit-dublin-hotel-97f27bbf98734f02a7fd392efca0a3ca" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to The Associated Press</a>. Video footage of the two leaving the hotel was shown to the jurors, and Mr. Farrell, Mr. McGregor’s lawyer, said Ms. Hand looked “happy, happy, happy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A lawyer for Ms. Hand said during the trial that she was intoxicated on the night of the incident, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/mma-fighter-conor-mcgregor-assaulted-woman-at-dublin-hotel-jury-finds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“full of drugs,”</a> The Guardian reported.</p><p>Mr. McGregor, who also testified during the two-week trial, has consistently denied the allegations of assault.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nikita Hand, center, outside the High Court in Dublin on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Lawless/Press Association, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After Ms. Hand went to the authorities in early 2019, Mr. McGregor was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/sports/conor-mcgregor-sexual-assault.html" title="">arrested, questioned and released</a>. The police referred the case to prosecutors, who ultimately declined to pursue criminal charges.</p><p>While the investigation was underway, Mr. McGregor largely vanished from the public eye.</p><p>Irish news outlets began reporting on the investigation in 2019, but were limited by strict laws regarding what journalists can say about ongoing criminal cases. Instead of naming Mr. McGregor, reporters had to use terms such as “Irish sports star.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2021, Ms. Hand filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/sports/conor-mcgregor-lawsuit-ufc.html" title="">lawsuit against Mr. McGregor</a> in Ireland’s High Court. At the time, Mr. McGregor called the allegations “old news” and said that he had been cleared by the authorities of any wrongdoing.</p><p>The civil court verdict may put public prosecutors under pressure to review the case.</p><p>Mr. McGregor’s fan base has been sharply divided about his culpability. Some pledged undying support for a figure they see as a source of Irish pride, while others have grown tired of his antics.</p><p>In the last several years, Mr. McGregor has been plagued by legal troubles, both in Europe and the United States. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to assault for <a href="https://www.si.com/mma/2019/11/01/conor-mcgregor-fined-for-punching-man-in-bar" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">punching a man at a bar in Ireland</a> while promoting his brand of whiskey. The previous year, he was put on probation in New York for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/sports/conor-mcgregor-ufc-barclays.html" title="">hurling a hand truck at a bus</a>.</p><p>And yet he has continued to find success. This year, Mr. McGregor appeared alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/movies/road-house-review-jake-gyllenhaal.html" title="">a remake</a> of “Road House,” the 1989 blockbuster starring Patrick Swayze. Mr. McGregor plays the villain.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
