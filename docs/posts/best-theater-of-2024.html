Box office grosses, if not quite back to prepandemic levels, seem likely to meet or exceed last year’s $1.6 billion. But the real health of the commercial theater, for me, is demonstrated by how much it offers its audiences, not its investors. That’s why, most years, my list of best shows is top-heavy with the provocative work being brewed Off Broadway. If my latest list tilts the other way, perhaps that reflects Broadway’s liberal borrowings from the noncommercial sector — borrowings and often improvements. My Top 10, listed chronologically and covering the period from December 2023 through the end of November, are therefore mostly shows that, wherever they started and wherever they wind up, put a premium on provocation, sure, but also entertainment. That’s what I call healthy.</p><h3 id="link-33b1e7cf"><span><strong>‘Appropriate’ by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sarah Paulson, center, in her Tony Award-winning performance in “Appropriate.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Most plays about racism dramatize the damage done to its victims. But “Appropriate,” which opened last December in a Second Stage Theater production, looks instead at the sickening effects that hatred can have on its perpetrators — and their heirs. On the surface a “dividing the estate” play, with the children of a good ol’ boy squabbling over their inherited real and unreal estate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/12/theater/appropriate-broadway-branden-jacobs-jenkins-sarah-paulson.html" title="">Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s uproarious tale of family guilt</a> (directed by Lila Neugebauer and with a blistering, Tony-winning performance by Sarah Paulson) was in effect a corroded mirror reflecting America’s worst (and worst-kept) secrets. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/theater/appropriate-broadway-review.html" title=""><em>our review of “Appropriate”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/theater/sarah-paulson-appropriate-broadway.html" title=""><em>our profile of Paulson</em></a><em>.)</em></p><h3 id="link-22929f4e"><span><strong>‘Terce: A Practical Breviary’ by Heather Christian</strong></span></h3><p>The new year brought with it a new prayer, if you were willing to go to a former Sunday school in Brooklyn to find it. At the Irondale Center in Fort Greene, a large cast of “caregivers and makers” offered an unusual liturgy, performing Heather Christian’s ritual of praise for “the divine feminine.” The visionary composer’s typically catholic musical references — plainsong, gospel, electronica, soul and New Orleans funk — short-circuited rational analysis, inviting transcendence in much the way the rituals of the established church do. But this time, in Keenan Tyler Oliphant’s richly welcoming staging, the transcendence was for everyone, of any faith or none.

But the mostly true story of Elmer McCurdy — wastrel, roustabout, schnook and sideshow attraction — got a brilliant coda in this Off Broadway show at the Minetta Lane Theater. The lovingly serious direction by David Cromer tempered the absurdity of the tale with sweetness and humor, and the cast, let by Andrew Durand as McCurdy, responded to the tumbleweed of a score with gorgeous singing. It’s the kind of musical you’d never find on Broadway — except that you might, next year. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/10/theater/dead-outlaw-review.html" title=""><em>our review of “Dead Outlaw”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/10/theater/dead-outlaw-review.html" title=""><em>the story behind the show</em></a><em>.)</em></p><h3 id="link-14bc2723"><span><strong>‘Mary Jane’ by Amy Herzog</strong></span></h3><p>Rachel McAdams starred in this heartbreaker as an alarmingly upbeat woman managing the unending crisis of her 2-year-old son’s catastrophic disorders. But can you call it “managing” when there is no hope for him or for her? That, at its heart, is the condition that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/theater/amy-herzog-enemy-people-broadway.html" title="">Amy Herzog</a>’s steel-trap play explored: The death of the self in the love for one’s child. In its original, Off Broadway production at New York Theater Workshop in 2017, Anne Kauffman’s scalpel of a production seemed personal; post-pandemic, on Broadway at the Manhattan Theater Club, her staging seemed much larger, with the whole world, not just Mary Jane, refusing to accept a dire prognosis. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/theater/mary-jane-review-rachel-mcadams.html" title=""><em>our review of “Mary Jane”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/07/theater/rachel-mcadams-broadway.html" title=""><em>our profile of Rachel McAdams</em></a><em>.)</em></p><h3 id="link-247ea65a"><span><strong>‘Illinoise’ by Sufjan Stevens, Justin Peck and Jackie Sibblies Drury</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ricky Ubeda, seated, with, from left, Byron Tittle, Christine Flores and Kara Chan in “Illinoise” at the Park Avenue Armory.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>I’m not usually a fan of jukebox musicals, those thin concoctions of pop star catalogs. But jukebox dancicals are a different story. That different story was particularly powerful in “Illinoise,” which arrived at the Park Avenue Armory in March and transferred to Broadway in April. Even for a dancical it was novel: As 12 friends danced their tales of late adolescence around a campfire, three singers hovering above them performed songs from Sufjan Stevens’s similarly titled 2005 concept album. By not forcing the two channels of information into overliteral connections, the show made the exploration of the hot zone between childhood and adulthood at least doubly moving. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/theater/illinoise-review-sufjan-stevens-justin-pick.html" title=""><em>our review of “Illinoise”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/theater/illinoise-justin-peck-sufjan-stevens-jackie-sibblies-drury.html" title=""><em>our coverage of its creation</em></a><em>.)</em></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-497d72bc"><span><strong>‘Cats: The Jellicle Ball’ by Andrew Lloyd Webber and T.S. Eliot</strong></span></h3><p>If the right idea can transform the wrong material, the directors Zhailon Levingston and Bill Rauch certainly had great wrong material to start with. That would be the musical “Cats,” derided for decades as the epitome of kitsch. But in their production, at the Perelman Performing Arts Center in downtown Manhattan, the kitties moved from their purgatorial junkyard to a Harlem ballroom, trading their woo-woo metaphysics for a real-world vogueing competition. Sensationally costumed (by Qween Jean) and bewigged (by Nikiya Mathis), the story of outcats fighting their way in was performed as if it were Shakespeare. And guess what? In its scope and pathos and poetry, it almost was. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/theater/cats-the-jellicle-ball-review.html" title=""><em>our review of “Cats: The Jellicle Ball”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/theater/cats-ballroom-revival-pac-nyc.html" title=""><em>the story of its creation</em></a><em>.)</em></p><h3 id="link-5a2f89f2"><span><strong>‘Oh, Mary!’ by Cole Escola</strong></span></h3><p>It’s a shame that flat-out comedies don’t get much respect; the theater environment is healthier with them, and so are we. In moving from the Lucille Lortel Theater downtown to the heart of Broadway, this madcap <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/theater/cole-escola-oh-mary-mary-todd-lincoln.html" title="">Mary Todd Lincoln fantasia</a> — she’s a would-be cabaret star married to a very Gaybraham Lincoln — may turn that tide. Directed with sensational precision by Sam Pinkleton, the story leavened history while deepening drag, with over-the-top performances by Cole Escola (as Mary) and the rest of the cast nevertheless reflecting an almost balletic control over gesture and pose. For these characters, camp is merely a means of committing fully to ludicrous goals. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/theater/oh-mary-review-cole-escola.html" title=""><em>our review of “Oh, Mary!”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/style/cole-escola-oh-mary-broadway-style.html" title=""><em>our look at Escola’s style</em></a><em>.)</em></p><h3 id="link-37ab6d96"><span><strong>‘The Hills of California’ by Jez Butterworth</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Laura Donnelly, far left, as a single mother of four girls in “The Hills of California.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In the hardscrabble 1950s, a widow with four girls to raise doesn’t have much time for dreams. But boy, does Veronica have them anyway. As played by the terrific Laura Donnelly, she’s an English Madame Rose, training her brood for a shot at showbiz and wasting not even one gesture on her own likability. The play itself is more generous, jumping ahead to 1972 then back again as the girls become exactly the women Veronica tried not to make them. If that sounds dour, Sam Mendes’s filled-with-song Broadway staging made the yarn compulsively enjoyable, a mini-series boiled down to three hours that still left you wanting more. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/theater/the-hills-of-california-review.html" title=""><em>our review of “The Hills of California”</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/theater/laura-donnelly-hills-of-california-broadway.html" title=""><em>our profile of Donnelly</em></a><em>.)</em></p><h3 id="link-4c712047"><span><strong>‘Our Town’ by Thornton Wilder</strong></span></h3><p>If you recall this 1938 play as small, sweet or old-fashioned, its Grover’s Corners as a dusty, distant Hooterville, well, no. “Our Town” is titanic, beyond time and brutal. In its depiction of “the life of a village against the life of the stars,” as Wilder described it, it compares our human span, unfavorably, to astronomical time, our joys and griefs to so much dust. And in case you might miss the idea that this applies to us now as much as to audiences who first saw it on the eve of World War II, Kenny Leon’s production, starring a wonderfully dry Jim Parsons, made it plain, in its casting, its costuming and choice of music, that the “our” in the title means everyone. <em>(Read </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/theater/our-town-review-jim-parsons.html" title=""><em>our review of “Our Town.”</em></a><em>)</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h3 id="link-488ef4b8"><span><strong>‘Maybe Happy Ending’ by Hue Park and Will Aronson</strong></span></h3><p>Every season deserves a “nerdical”: a supersmart, serious and usually small-scale show you can’t believe made it to Broadway. This one, about robots, may be the nerdiest of all. By 2064, Oliver (Darren Criss) and Claire (Helen J Shen) are obsolete, living out their days in a retirement home in Seoul. But for all its sci-fi whimsy, “Maybe Happy Ending,” directed with breathtaking bravura by Michael Arden, is a totally human heartbreaker. When the robots, having fallen for each other, realize that their operating systems are failing at different rates, they must ask if strong emotions like love and loss are too painful to experience.
