    <h1>Trump Travels to Michigan to Mark 100 Days in Office</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The trip comes at a pivotal time for Mr. Trump’s presidency.</p><p>His expansive tariffs have hurt the stock market and contributed to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls.html" title="">drop in his approval rating</a>. A majority of Americans approved of Mr. Trump’s performance in office throughout January and February, but he is now struggling with more people disapproving of him.</p><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html" title="">New York Times/Siena College poll</a>, voters said he had “gone too far” on issue after issue: his tariffs, his immigration enforcement, his cuts to the federal work force.</p><p>Against that backdrop, Mr. Trump’s trip is meant to send a message that he is committed to working for Americans who have been left behind by globalization. He is expected to make the case that he is working to end decades of unfair trade policies that have cost American jobs, and he plans to highlight the support of the United Auto Workers for his tariff policies.</p><p>The president is also expected to speak about his crackdown on immigration, which has caused border crossings to drop sharply but also raised concerns about a lack of due process for those accused of violating laws.</p><p>Mr. Trump plans to cast himself as a man of action, highlighting the rapid pace of his executive orders. He has <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed 137 executive orders this year</a>, nearly as many as his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., did throughout his four years in office.</p></div></div>
