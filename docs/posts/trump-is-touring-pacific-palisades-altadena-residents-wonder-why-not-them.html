Historically, lawmakers from both parties have supported FEMA, knowing that their district or state could need the agency’s help at any time.</p><p>Mr. Trump inaccurately characterized FEMA’s role, which is to support state and local officials only if those officials are unable to respond to disasters on their own, and only at the request of a governor.</p><p>Disaster response work is “locally executed, state managed and federally supported,” Pete Gaynor, who ran FEMA during Mr. Trump’s first term, said in an interview. The agency is a backstop, not a first responder, he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s statements in North Carolina echoed comments he made on Wednesday night in an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6367535604112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview on Fox News</a>, saying “ FEMA is getting in the way of everything.” Referring to Oklahoma, he said: “If they get hit with a tornado or something, let Oklahoma fix it. You don’t need — and then the federal government can help them out with the money.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s comments have FEMA’s staff “feeling betrayed and scared,” said an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a fear of reprisal. “Our employees have been there for the American people over and over again,” the employee said. “We already had a burnout issue at this agency that his statement and interview just put on steroids.”</p><p>Project 2025, the blueprint for a Republican administration that was produced by the Heritage Foundation, calls for flipping the financial burden of response to small disasters so that 75 percent is carried by states and the rest by the federal government. Russell Vought, the chief architect of Project 2025, is Mr. Trump’s pick to run the Office of Management and Budget, where he would significantly shape the federal budget.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fire-affected residents met with FEMA officials in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 14.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Frederic J. Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A growing number of federal emergency managers say some reforms are needed and that FEMA is overextended.</p><p>“The real question is how those burdens should be shared at all levels of government,” said Daniel Kaniewski, the second-highest ranking official at FEMA during Mr. Trump’s first administration and now a managing director at Marsh McLennan, a consulting firm.</p><p>The past four administrators of FEMA — two appointed by Democrats, and two appointed by Mr. Trump — have made versions of that argument, calling for states to do more. But states generally want more help, not less.</p><p>Mr. Trump may force states to take on a greater role.</p><p>“The gentle nudging hasn’t changed the outcome,” said Roy Wright, who held senior roles at FEMA during the Obama and first Trump administrations. “We need a different approach.”</p><p>That debate comes as extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-key-driver-of-catastrophic-impacts-of-hurricane-helene-that-devastated-both-coastal-and-inland-communities/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severe</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/climate/california-fires-climate-change-disasters.html" title="">because of climate change</a>, and Mr. Trump has canceled some of the policies designed to make the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/trump-climate-policies.html" title="">more resilient to climate shocks</a>.</p><p>The president has appointed as FEMA’s acting administrator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/fema-announcement-cameron-hamilton.html" title="">Cameron Hamilton</a>, a former Navy SEAL and a former director of emergency medical services at the Department of Homeland Security who has also appeared on Fox News as a military analyst. Unlike previous FEMA administrators, Mr. Hamilton does not appear to have experience managing responses to large-scale hurricanes, wildfires or other disasters.</p><p>The <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-05.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section in Project 2025 on disasters</a> was written by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the agency responsible for FEMA in Mr. Trump’s first term. In addition to shifting more costs to states for small disasters, the blueprint called for a disaster “deductible” — reducing federal aid to states that fail to protect their communities against disasters. That switch would push states “to take a more proactive role in their own preparedness,” Mr. Cuccinelli wrote.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ken Cuccinelli, the deputy secretary responsible for FEMA in Mr. Trump’s first term, wrote the section of Project 2025 pertaining to disasters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The idea of a disaster deductible was <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/12/2017-00467/establishing-a-deductible-for-femas-public-assistance-program" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously proposed</a> by the Obama administration. Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator at the time, argued that states needed a financial incentive to impose tougher building codes, curb construction in high-risk areas and otherwise reduce their exposure to hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters.</p><p>“We’re not seeing a change in behavior,” Mr. Fugate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-12/fema-s-director-wants-capitalism-to-protect-us-from-climate-change" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Bloomberg News</a> in 2016. “There’s got to be a forcing mechanism.”</p><p>But states balked at the idea of higher costs, and the idea fizzled out. After Mr. Trump first took office in 2017, his FEMA administrator, Brock Long, proposed adjusting the amount of federal disaster aid that states could receive, based on whether they had taken steps like strengthening building codes.</p><p>Mr. Long also believes FEMA funding should be replaced with “block grants” — giving states part of the cost of responding and rebuilding after disasters. That would allow governors “greater control over resources and recovery efforts to meet the unique demands of their communities,” Mr. Long said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>The challenge with shifting responsibility to states is that they vary in their ability to respond to disasters, said Pete Gaynor, who succeeded Mr. Long as FEMA administrator in 2019.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Search-and-recovery specialists from FEMA examining wreckage from Hurricane Helene in Swannanoa, N.C., in October.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Loren Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Only a dozen or so states, such as Florida, Texas and California, have the staff and experience needed to manage large disasters, Mr. Gaynor said.</p><p>But Mr. Gaynor said block grants could reduce costs. Instead of paying for disaster recovery that can sometimes last decades, FEMA would estimate the cost of recovery and send the money to the state.</p><p>If a state rebuilt for less, Mr. Gaynor said, it could invest the difference in measures to protect against future disasters, like building sea walls or elevating buildings. If costs exceeded the initial estimate, the state would have to pay the extra cost.</p><p>Some states would be receptive to block grants, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association, which represents state emergency management directors. “It’s an intriguing idea,” said Ms. Budd, who is director of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. She said Wyoming, because of its small population and relatively few disasters, doesn’t have the money to hire a large number of staff to manage disasters when they occur.</p><p>But Deanne Criswell, who ran FEMA during the Biden administration, said she worried that states without the expertise or resources to handle a recovery would simply fail to rebuild, leaving them more vulnerable to the next disaster.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deanne Criswell, who ran FEMA during the Biden administration, worried that states without the expertise to manage the recovery on their own would simply fail to rebuild.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Ms. Criswell agreed with the idea that FEMA does too much. But she said part of the problem was that the agency was taking on work outside of severe weather events — for example, managing the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106676.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal government’s response</a> to the Covid-19 pandemic under the first Trump administration, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/14/us/politics/fema-migrant-children-border-biden.html" title="">helping shelter unaccompanied minors</a> who were intercepted at the southern border.</p><p>Ms. Criswell agreed with the idea that states should do more to prepare for disasters, which could reduce the burden on FEMA. Like her predecessors, she tried to get states to strengthen their building codes to reduce their exposure to disasters. But there has been little movement among states that oppose tougher standards.</p><p>In his Fox News interview, Mr. Trump said that FEMA had failed to do enough to help storm-damaged North Carolina last fall and that it was politically motivated. “The Democrats actually used FEMA not to help North Carolina,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.</p><p>Ms. Criswell said Mr. Trump was wrong. She said that FEMA had deployed personnel to North Carolina before the storm made landfall, with an army of staff members and partners that eventually numbered in the thousands. “I don’t know what he thinks we should have been doing,” Ms. Criswell said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="33" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZTNlOTM0MmYtNWQxOS01ZmI4LTg0ODItOThmMjY5NWM0ZmUz"><div id="e3e9342f-5d19-5fb8-8482-98f2695c4fe3" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#e3e9342f-5d19-5fb8-8482-98f2695c4fe3"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron"><img alt="Chris Cameron" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-25T01:28:30.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 8:28 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>President Trump is now railing against the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/trump-newsom-water-fires.html" title="">delta smelt</a>, a protected species of small fish that the president is blaming for the lack of water needed to fight the fires in California.</p><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div id="" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url=""><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron"><img alt="Chris Cameron" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-25T01:28:56.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 8:28 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>“They talk about the delta smelt, which is a fish that’s this big,” Trump said, showing a space between his thumb and index finger. “It really doesn’t have to be protected because it’s in other areas.

He noted that the agency had a consistent presence in Chicago, where former President Barack Obama still owns a home.</p><p>A spokeswoman for ICE said that there had been no immigration enforcement action at or near the school.</p><p>Some school systems in states like New York, California, New Jersey and Illinois reached out to parents on Friday to try to reassure them that federal agents would not be allowed on school grounds without a judicial warrant.</p><p>In Chicago, as in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/sanctuary-cities-trump-immigration.html" title="">other jurisdictions</a> that limit how much local officials can cooperate with federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, schools do not ask parents about their children’s immigration status.</p><p>Outside of John H. Hamline Elementary in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, several parents arrived to pull their children out of class early, as erroneous reports spread in texts and on Facebook that immigration agents were at the school. Even Gov. JB Pritzker chimed in on social media, referring to reports of “raids” at an elementary school.</p><p>“Within an hour of what was happening, the community got together,” said Berto Aguayo, a community organizer who rushed to the school as soon as he heard that ICE agents had been there.</p><p>Mr. Aguayo handed out leaflets in English and Spanish advising people of their rights, which immigration advocates have been doing all week.</p><p>“We want to make sure parents feel safe sending their kids to school,” he said.</p><p>Dana Goldstein<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmMxMzNlNzUtMzk1Yy01MTcxLTg1ZTktZmUwNzM3MGYwYjUy"><div id="6c133e75-395c-5171-85e9-fe07370f0b52" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#6c133e75-395c-5171-85e9-fe07370f0b52"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron"><img alt="Chris Cameron" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/us/politics/author-chris-cameron/author-chris-cameron-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-25T00:47:53.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 7:47 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>President Trump has just arrived at a roundtable in the Pacific Palisades region with local leaders and members of Congress.

Gavin Newsom of California greeting President Trump on the tarmac in Los Angeles on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>After nearly two weeks of cross-country jousting, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California waited alone Friday at the bottom of the steps outside Air Force One to greet President Trump as he arrived in Los Angeles to tour wildfire damage.</p><p>It wasn’t clear how the meeting would go. Mr. Trump often derides the governor as “Newscum.” And Mr. Newsom has accused Mr. Trump of orchestrating an assault on the 14th Amendment by signing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/judge-blocks-birthright-citizenship.html" title="">an executive order to end birthright citizenship</a>.</p><div><p>But after Mr. Trump exited the plane and walked slowly down the steps, the two men greeted each other with a long warm handshake and shoulder clasps. Mr. Trump then brought Mr. Newsom with him to speak to waiting reporters.</p><p>“I appreciate the governor coming out and meeting me,” Mr. Trump said, wearing a dark blazer and a “Make America Great Again” baseball hat. “Very much.”</p><p>Mr. Newsom, dressed in bluejeans and a denim, button down shirt, echoed the sentiment. “Thank you for being here. It means a great deal.”</p><p>It is hard to imagine two officials who are more ideologically different. If Mr. Trump is the leader of conservative America, Mr. Newsom is one of the most prominent leaders of liberal America. They both relish their respective roles.</p><p>In advance of the trip, the White House released a long list of California public officials who would meet with Mr. Trump later at a firehouse in Pacific Palisades. It included Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles. Mr. Newsom was not on the list, and went to the airport on his own. While in the air, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said she was surprised to hear that Mr. Newsom would be greeting Mr. Trump.</p><p>“That’s news to me,” she said. “I look forward to seeing him there. And I’m sure the president does, too.”</p><p>Any animosity was put aside during their short time together on the tarmac. Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Newsom for meeting him, and Mr. Newsom recalled how the White House helped California during the Covid pandemic, during Mr. Trump’s last term.</p><p>“We’re going to need your help,” Mr. Newsom said. “You were there for us, during Covid, I don’t forget that, and I have all the expectations that we will be able to work together for a speedy recovery.”</p><p>Mr. Trump nodded. “We are going to get this done.”</p><p>Before he arrived, Mr. Trump had said he would extract concessions from California on water usage and a voter ID law that Democrats are very likely to resist as a condition of federal aid. Mr. Newsom said he expected the federal government to treat California the way it treated other states grappling with a natural disaster. But that policy tug of war didn’t materialize during their brief meeting.</p><p>“We are going to need your support,” Mr. Newsom said.</p><p>Mr. Trump responded warmly to the governor’s olive branch.</p><p>“We are looking to get something completed,” Mr. Trump said. “The way you get something completed is you work together.”</p><p>Mr. Newsom and Mr. Trump appeared to have come to a similar conclusion, at least for now: Americans are looking for cooperation, rather than confrontation, in the aftermath of the fires. Throughout their brief meeting at the airport and then speaking to reporters, they seemed to be reading from the same script.</p><p>“They are going to need a lot of federal help,” Mr. Trump said, turning to Mr. Newsom with a slight grin. “Unless they don’t need any?”</p><p>“We need your help,” Mr. Newsom said. He turned to the cameras. “I have all the confidence in the world that we will work together.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off"

href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-mexico-city-policy-an-explainer/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Mexico City Rule,”</a> which bars federal funding from going to any overseas nongovernmental organization that performs or promotes abortions.</p><p>The move came after he addressed thousands of abortion opponents in Washington on Friday to mark the 52nd anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which created a national right to abortion and which the court overturned in 2022.</p><div><p>Federal law already bans the use of taxpayer dollars to support abortion services abroad. But in 1984 President Ronald Reagan went one step further, blocking foreign aid to nongovernmental organizations that discuss abortion as part of family planning services, or advocate abortion rights, even if those groups are not using American tax dollars to do so.</p><p>In the four decades since, the policy has had a seesaw history. Democratic presidents, including Joseph R. Biden Jr., have revoked it and Republicans have reinstated it. It has been in effect for 21 of the past 40 years.</p><p>That Mr. Trump reinstated the ban is not a surprise. When he ran for president in 2016, he took a strong anti-abortion stance, winning the support of Christian conservatives by promising to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would overturn Roe. In the two and a half years since Roe was overturned, abortion has become a more complicated issue for Republicans, and Mr. Trump did not make it a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign.</p><p>But Mr. Trump still needs to tend to his party’s right wing, particularly because his pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/us/politics/rfk-jr-abortion-ban.html" title="">muddled record</a> on abortion. While visiting with senators on Capitol Hill last month, Mr. Kennedy promised Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, that he would support reinstatement of the policy as part of a broad anti-abortion agenda.</p><p>“He committed to me to reinstate President Trump’s prolife policies at HHS,” <a href="https://x.com/HawleyMO/status/1869135780607869235" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Hawley wrote on social media</a>, using the initials for the Department of Health and Human Services. “That includes reinstating the Mexico City policy &amp; ending taxpayer funding for abortions domestically.”</p><p>In April 2023, when he was running for president, Mr. Kennedy said he would support a federal ban on abortion after the first trimester of pregnancy, but then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/14/us/politics/rfk-jr-abortion-ban.html" title="">quickly backtracked.</a> His campaign released a statement saying that Mr. Kennedy’s “position on abortion is that it is always the woman’s right to choose,” adding, “He does not support legislation banning abortion.”</p><p>The following year, he posted a <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1789121919951704481" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lengthy message</a> on social media outlining his views. “I support the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point,” he wrote. “I believe that point should be when the baby is viable outside the womb.”</p><p>Advocates for reproductive rights say the Mexico City policy has a devastating effect on women overseas, driving up the number of unintended pregnancies, scaling back much-needed family planning programs and sometimes leading women to seek unsafe abortions, which are a major cause of maternal mortality.</p><p>The last time Mr. Trump reinstated the policy, when he first took office in 2017, he also expanded it by directing the State Department to identify additional organizations that might fall under the ban. Two years later, in 2019, Mr. Trump further expanded the policy to bar federal funding for overseas groups that give money to other foreign groups that perform abortions.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzgwNTQyMzI1LTJmOTctNThjOS1iOTdmLWFkMjg2ODg4MmQzMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#trump-is-touring-pacific-palisades-altadena-residents-wonder-why-not-them" data-source-id="100000009947906"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-24T23:57:35.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 6:57 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Steve Lamb, a resident of Altadena, Calif., sits among the remnants of his home that burned in the Eaton fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>To Steve Lamb, it felt like a snub. His home was reduced to ash. His cars were charred wrecks. And on Friday, his president — Donald J. Trump, for whom Mr. Lamb voted in November — was far from his fire-ravaged community of Altadena.</p><div><p>Mr. Trump was in the region, about 40 miles away touring destroyed homes in Pacific Palisades. But it wasn’t close enough for Mr. Lamb.</p><p>“If I was the president, this is where I would go,” Mr. Lamb, 67, said of Altadena.</p><p>He sat at a table in what used to be his backyard, staring mournfully at a scorched stack of ceramic cups and bowls he and his wife collected over the years. A residential designer, he had rescued them from the rubble of his home, a more than century-old Craftsman that was <a href="https://1ec9ca31.streaklinks.com/CSWnLZpa2kNv8ZMYBwA7wXgt/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timandersenarchitect.com%2FLouisEaston-and-Simple-Living.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made by famed architect Louis B. Easton</a>. Nearby, his prized 1941 Lincoln Continental, one of fewer than 2,000 ever built, slumped on blackened rims, two of its tires faded to dust.</p><p>As part of the president’s trip to Southern California, Mr. Trump visited Pacific Palisades, a coastal neighborhood of Los Angeles known for its affluence and celebrity figures and where the median sale price of a home is about $3.1 million. The Palisades fire, which destroyed more than 6,700 structures, had left much of the area a desolate wasteland. His agenda included a briefing at a fire station before heading back to the airport by early evening.</p><p>Altadena, a more middle-class hillside community tucked up against the San Gabriel Mountains, had also been devastated by flames. The Eaton fire broke out on the same day as the Palisades fire, burning more than 9,400 structures and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/la-fires-altadena-historic-black-community.html" title="">devastating a historic Black haven</a>. The median sale price of a home there is about $1.3 million.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ash from the Eaton fire coats gravestones at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, Calif.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But in the days since the fires started on Jan. 7, many Altadena residents have expressed frustration that their town and their losses have been overshadowed by those affected by the Palisades fire. Although it was unclear why Mr. Trump chose to only visit Pacific Palisades, it felt personal to several residents.</p><p>“I would come and look at all these Democrats and constituents who are African American,” Mr. Lamb said. “And I’d be saying, ‘Look, I know you didn’t vote for me, but I have your back.’ It’s very disappointing that he’s not going to do that.”</p><p>Mr. Lamb served on the Altadena town council for nearly two decades. After years voting as a Democrat, he said he had been turned off by the party and ended up supporting Mr. Trump in the recent election. “Probably the majority of Altadena didn’t vote for him,” he said. “It just so happens I did. And I’m really disappointed.”</p><p>Just around the corner on a cul-de-sac, Alana Lewis, 58, was assessing the condition of her house, which had been spared from the flames. It had significant smoke damage and the utilities were still out. She has been unable to use her home to operate her child-care business, cutting off her source of income.</p><p>“Altadena has generations of people who lived here, and we are affected by the fires as well,” Ms. Lewis said. “There’s a lot of damage here, a lot of misplaced families, a lot of misplaced children. Children lost their schools, their homes. It’s really bad here, and he needs to come.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has criticized the state’s Democratic leaders, accusing them of mismanaging the response to the fire. Several of those Democrats have visited both the Palisades and Altadena, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California.</p><p>Kamala Harris, whose home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood was in an evacuation zone during the Palisades fire, visited Altadena on Monday after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Appearing with her husband, Douglas Emhoff, she met with firefighters and residents and said she planned to help restore and rebuild the community.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, visit Los Angeles County Fire Department Fire Station 12 in Altadena, Calif., on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Selina Sanders, an Altadena resident and small business owner, said she has been disappointed in how Mr. Trump and Mr. Newsom have seemingly used the fires to point fingers at each other.</p><p>“Based on what I know, it’s just all like a political game,” Ms. Sanders, 42, said. “It’s always like, what he thinks of Newsom and what Newsom thinks about him. It’s all calculated on their end.”</p><p>Ms. Sanders, whose home sustained significant smoke damage, said Mr. Trump should have made the time to visit her town. “I feel like we’re just going to be forgotten,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Trump has threatened to withhold disaster recovery aid from California unless the state changed environmental policies that he claimed had prevented enough water from going to Southern California. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/trump-newsom-water-fires.html" title="">Water experts have said</a> the problems fighting the fires had nothing to do with water transfers from the north and that the president has misrepresented complex water dynamics.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yancy Fort hugs his neighbor Oscar Gomez on Friday as they go through the ashes of their homes, which burned in the Eaton fire in Altadena, Calif.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Still, Mr. Trump made clear that his trip was about securing two things: “Voter ID so that people have a chance to vote, and I want to see the water be released and come down to Los Angeles and throughout the state.”</p><p>Some Altadena residents appreciated that Mr. Trump was visiting a burn area, even if it was not in their own backyard.</p><p>“It’s fabulous,” said Adina Catalanotti, a retired dancer whose home was one of just a few still standing on her block.</p><p>Ms. Catalanotti, 64, said she was not surprised the president was sticking to Pacific Palisades. The destruction there was terrible, too, she said, adding that he likely had a limited schedule. “We can only just move on and pray,” she said.</p><p>And then she continued on the quest she had been on: looking for a neighborhood cat named Tux. She held a bag of cat food in one hand, a cane in the other.</p><p>Tux has been spotted just once since the fires started.</p><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvOTJjNmU1Y2MtNGNlZi01N2RmLTlhMTAtN2ZmNGNlODllODc4"><div id="92c6e5cc-4cef-57df-9a10-7ff4ce89e878" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#92c6e5cc-4cef-57df-9a10-7ff4ce89e878"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nagourney"><img alt="Adam Nagourney" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-adam-nagourney/author-adam-nagourney-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-adam-nagourney/author-adam-nagourney-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-adam-nagourney/author-adam-nagourney-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-24T23:53:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 6:53 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Governor Newsom and President Trump appear to have come to a similar conclusion, at least for now: That Americans are looking for cooperation, rather than confrontation, in dealing with the fires of Los Angeles. </p><p>“They are going to need a lot of federal help,” Trump said, turning to Newsom with a slight grin. “Unless they don’t need any?”</p><p>“We need your help,” Newsom said.

Huffman, wrote that he was requesting the state and local assistance after determining that the current immigration circumstances were a danger to “the lives, property, safety, or welfare of the residents of all 50 states and that an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens is arriving at the southern border of the United States.”</p><p>It was not immediately clear the scope of the move, though it was sure to invite legal challenges.</p><p>The declaration is one of several President Trump has sought to invoke in his first days as he has vowed to crack down on immigration, saying he will shut down border crossings and block access to asylum. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/trump-national-emergencies.html" title="">declared a state of emergency on the southern border</a> that unleashes powers he would otherwise have to seek through Congress. The Justice Department this week also threatened to investigate and potentially prosecute local officials that do not help the Trump administration carry out federal immigration authorities.</p><p>A state or local agency must agree in writing to be able to take steps to arrest or deport migrants, and some states are almost certain to push back on the measure.</p><p>Texas, for instance, has indicated a desire to take immigration enforcement in its own hands. A state law enacted in March gives local police agencies the power to arrest migrants who enter the country without authorization, though it is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/19/us/texas-immigration-supreme-court/heres-the-latest-on-the-fallout?smid=url-share" title="">frozen as a challenge</a> moves through the courts. </p><p>Recently, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has proposed a special legislative session to begin on Monday to expand local officials’ power to detain and deport people who are in the country illegally, and to penalize those officials who do not comply. Iowa has passed its own law that makes it a state crime to enter after being deported or denied entry into the United States. That law has also been paused because of a court challenge.</p><p>Some immigration experts said the Trump administration’s move was likely to incite lawsuits.</p><p>“This law is decades old and has never been invoked,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a lawyer at the American Immigration Council, wrote on social media on Friday. “So it’s a blank slate, which seems more about border enforcement than internal enforcement.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Huffman issued a separate memo, saying his agency would give federal agents, including those at the F.B.I., Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives the authority to enforce federal immigration laws. The memo did not go into detail about how it would work. </p><p>Patricia Mazzei<!-- --> in Miami contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2ZkYmEwMWExLTZkNjktNWZmOC04NGY1LTk0YjYwYmQ0NGJiNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#embassy-us-flag-blm-gay-pride" data-source-id="100000009947257"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christine-hauser"><img alt="Christine Hauser" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-christine-hauser/author-christine-hauser-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-christine-hauser/author-christine-hauser-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-christine-hauser/author-christine-hauser-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-vigdor"><img alt="Neil Vigdor" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/25/reader-center/author-neil-vigdor/author-neil-vigdor-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/25/reader-center/author-neil-vigdor/author-neil-vigdor-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/25/reader-center/author-neil-vigdor/author-neil-vigdor-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-24T22:39:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 5:39 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U.S. flag and a rainbow flag hanging at the United States Embassy in Moscow in June 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuri Kochetkov/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The State Department has ordered that only United States flags be flown at embassies and consulates around the world, a departure from the Biden administration, under which pride and Black Lives Matter flags were sometimes displayed.</p><p>The White House drew attention to the change in a news release on Friday that listed some of the actions taken by President Trump during his first 100 hours in office.</p><div><p>The directive was reported earlier this week by <a href="https://freebeacon.com/trump-administration/trump-state-department-tells-embassies-and-outposts-only-fly-the-stars-and-stripes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Free Beacon</a>, a conservative news website, which said that prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action flags would still be allowed at embassies and other U.S. diplomatic outposts.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the policy on Friday.</p><p>The measure represented another step by Mr. Trump to dismantle the policies of his predecessor, former President Joseph R.

On Monday, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-transgender-race-education.html" title="">ordered his administration to gut</a> policies put in place under Mr. Biden that were aimed at preventing sexual discrimination and seeking to protect transgender people. Mr. Trump also began rolling back <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-order-discrimination-federal-hiring.html" title="">targeted diversity programs</a> that were intended to reverse decades of systemic inequities.</p><p>The flag policy has undergone changes with each administration. The display of rainbow flags had previously been routine at American diplomatic posts since 2011, when Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/world/united-states-to-use-aid-to-promote-gay-rights-abroad.html" title="">said in a speech</a> that “gay rights are human rights.”</p><p>In 2019, under the previous Trump administration, the State Department instructed missions that the rainbow flag may not be displayed on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/world/americas/pride-flags-us-embassies.html" title="">“public-facing flagpole.”</a> (Some embassies, such as those in South Korea and Israel, still put up pride flags or banners in public view, but not on poles.)</p><p>In 2021, the policy swung back again, when Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/us/us-embassy-pride-flag.html" title="">authorized U.S. missions</a> to fly the rainbow flag on the same pole as the American flag during pride month in June.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzIwYzMyMDE5LTkwODUtNTRhZi05OGFhLWRjMTAzM2E1OTBkNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#steward-rhodes-oath-keepers-legal" data-source-id="100000009948056"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alan-feuer"><img alt="Alan Feuer" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/20/reader-center/author-alan-feuer/author-alan-feuer-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-24T21:56:42.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 4:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, visited a coffee shop on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, after President Trump commuted his 18-year prison sentence for his role in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A little over two years ago, prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington obtained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/us/politics/oath-keepers-trial-verdict-jan-6.html" title="">a landmark conviction against Stewart Rhodes</a>, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, on charges of seditious conspiracy for the role he played in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>On Friday, the same office — now led by one of President Trump’s appointees, Ed Martin — effectively assumed the role of Mr. Rhodes’s defense lawyer, filing court papers that sought to reverse a federal judge’s order from earlier in the day that barred him and other convicted members of the far-right group from visiting Washington without permission.</p><div><p>The move was a stunning reversal for the prosecutors office, which for more than four years led the Justice Department’s sprawling investigation of the Capitol attack.</p><p>Since taking office as interim U.S. attorney this week, Mr. Martin has been working to execute Mr. Trump’s directive to end any Jan. 6-related criminal cases that are still active, filing a blizzard of motions in Federal District Court in Washington to dismiss them — sometimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6.html" title="">drawing angry responses from judges</a>. </p><p>The judge’s order barring Mr. Rhodes from Washington came after the far-right leader appeared on Tuesday at the local jail in Washington where many Jan. 6 defendants had been held in recent years. The next day, Mr. Rhodes — known for his piratical black eyepatch — showed up near the scene of the riot: a Dunkin’ Donuts shop in the Longworth House Office Building, adjacent to the Capitol.</p><p>As part of the evidence at Mr. Rhodes’s trial, the jury heard a recording of him threatening violence in the days shortly after Jan. 6.</p><p>If Trump was “just gonna let himself be removed illegally, then we should have brought rifles,” Mr. Rhodes said in the recording. “We could have fixed it right then and there.”</p><p>On Friday morning, Judge Amit P. Mehta, who oversaw Mr. Rhodes’s case, issued an order altering the terms of his supervised release, saying he could no longer enter Washington without the judge’s permission. Unlike hundreds of other Jan. 6 defendants, Mr. Rhodes was not fully pardoned by Mr. Trump; his 18-year prison term was reduced to time served. So Judge Mehta asserted control over his conditions of release.</p><p>In the court papers filed after Judge Mehta’s order, Mr. Martin claimed that Mr. Rhodes was in fact “no longer subject to the terms of supervised release” under the clemency order Mr. Trump issued on Monday. Mr. Martin signed the papers personally, an unusual move for a U.S. attorney who typically has subordinates file court papers.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Martin sought to compare Mr. Rhodes’s situation with those of members of the Biden family and a general who served as Mr. Trump’s top military adviser in his first administration but fell from his graces.</p><p>“If a judge decided that Jim Biden, General Mark Milley, or another individual were forbidden to visit America’s capital — even after receiving a last-minute, pre-emptive pardon from the former president — I believe most Americans would object,” the statement said. “The individuals referenced in our motion have had their sentences commuted — period, end of sentence.”</p><p>Mr. Martin was, to say the least, an unusual choice to run the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, which took the lead in prosecuting members of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 on Mr. Trump’s behalf.</p><p>He himself was a prominent member of the “Stop the Steal” movement that sought to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. The day before the assault on the Capitol, he called in a speech for “die-hard true Americans” to work <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rnc-hires-prominent-stop-steal-advocate-help-craft-2024-platform-rcna155298" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">until their “last breath” to “stop the steal.”</a></p><p>According to his own <a href="https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1346908666763636741" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media posts</a>, he also appears to have been at the Capitol on Jan. 6. “Like Mardi Gras in DC today: love, faith and joy,” he wrote in one post. “Ignore <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/FakeNews?src=hashtag_click" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#FakeNews</a>.”</p><p>Moreover, Mr. Martin is still <a href="https://patriotfreedomproject.com/about-us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed as a board member</a> of the Patriot Freedom Project, one of the most prominent fund-raising organizations working to help pay legal fees for Jan. 6 defendants. He has also represented some of those defendants himself, squaring off against the very same federal prosecutors he now leads.</p><p>The friction over Mr. Rhodes came as tensions were already running high between Mr. Martin’s office and the federal bench in Washington. While the judges have grudgingly gone along with Mr. Martin’s motions to dismiss Jan. 6 cases, some of them have done so in orders declaring that nothing — not even a presidential decree — can erase what happened that day.</p><p>“The dismissal of this case cannot undo the ‘rampage that left multiple people dead, injured more than 140 people, and inflicted millions of dollars in damage,’” Judge Tanya S. Chutkan wrote in a decision formally ending <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/08/us/politics/john-banuelos-jan-6-gun-charges.html" title="">the case against John Banuelos</a>, who was charged with firing a pistol into the air on the grounds of the Capitol.</p><p>“It cannot diminish the heroism of law enforcement officers who ‘struggled, facing serious injury and even death, to control the mob that overwhelmed them,’” Judge Chutkan continued, quoting court filings in another Jan. 6 case. “It cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America’s sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzZlMDMyNzQ5LTM4YjMtNTA0My1hYzhkLWY3Mzk2NTY5MGYxZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/president-trump-news#house-oversight-committee-to-investigate-republican-complaints-about-banks" data-source-id="100000009948114"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rob-copeland"><img alt="Rob Copeland" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/24/reader-center/author-rob-copeland/author-rob-copeland-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/24/reader-center/author-rob-copeland/author-rob-copeland-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/24/reader-center/author-rob-copeland/author-rob-copeland-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-01-24T21:27:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Jan. 24, 2025, 4:27 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative James R.

Comer, a Kentucky Republican and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/us/politics/james-comer-republican-oversight-biden.html" title="">stalwart supporter</a> of Mr. Trump, <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-24-Letter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced that it was</a> “investigating improper debanking of individuals and entities based on political viewpoints or involvement in certain industries such as cryptocurrency and blockchain.”</p><div><p>The letter cited no new information about “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/crypto-debanking-trump.html" title="">debanking</a>,” or the closing of bank accounts against customer wishes. It included a list of earlier complaints made in interviews with the podcaster Joe Rogan, social media posts and even a passage in a recent memoir from the first lady, Melania Trump, in which she wrote, without evidence, that her son Barron’s account had been closed — a decision that she said “appeared to be rooted in political discrimination.”</p><p>Banks universally deny closing accounts for political reasons and generally say they are forced to act by regulations that require strict crackdowns against potential money-laundering activity and other suspicious transactions.</p><p>The House committee said it would seek to determine whether any closing of accounts “originates from the financial institutions themselves or from either implicit or explicit pressure from government regulators.”</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
