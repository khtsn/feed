    <h1>What Covid Taught Us</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>When the pandemic upended our lives five years ago today, it gave researchers a rare chance to learn more about who we are and how we live. The entire world changed at once, creating natural experiments everywhere. What happens when sports teams play in empty stadiums? When the government sends people money? When women stop wearing high heels? When children stop going to school?</p><p>In many cases, it was impossible to know what caused the specific changes — some aspect of the Covid pandemic or another invisible influence. But the findings demystified several aspects of our world. My colleague Irineo Cabreros and I wrote about them <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/11/upshot/covid-lessons.html" title="">in a story we published today</a>. Here are some highlights:</p><h2 id="link-3bd09643">Crowds help the home team</h2><p>When sports teams played in empty stadiums, research showed that yes, the fans made a difference: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15270025221100204" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Home teams played worse</a> without them around. They were less likely to win at home and had poorer performances. The effect was smaller for teams already accustomed to smaller crowds. But the home advantage wasn’t <em>just</em> about fans. When the N.B.A. restarted play, the top 22 teams isolated in Orlando, Fla., allowing researchers to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78901-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study the effects of jet lag</a>. Rebounding, shooting accuracy and wins were all higher among players who hadn’t traveled across time zones.</p><h2 id="link-9c564f3">Virtual doctor visits work …</h2><p>Telehealth, once uncommon, accounted for <a href="https://telehealthandmedicinetoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/280" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half of medical visits</a> early in the pandemic. Mostly, patients and doctors were satisfied with seeing one another online. Telehealth lowered health care costs. It was especially useful for treating chronic illnesses and for psychotherapy. And in some cases, the pandemic revealed, people don’t need to see a doctor at all. The number of patients showing up with mild appendicitis decreased, while the number with complicated appendicitis didn’t change, which suggested that some people who would typically have had surgery recovered on their own.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h2 id="link-2865a7ff">… but virtual school doesn’t</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Liana Finck</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When it came to learning, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html" title="">remote schooling wasn’t enough</a>. Across the country, in rich and poor districts, and among white, Black and Hispanic students, test scores in reading and math fell. Many students still haven’t caught up. There was learning loss even in countries that had shorter school closures than the United States did. But the data is clear: The sooner children returned to classrooms, even part time, the better they did.</p><h2 id="link-456ad3e7">Dolphins talked more</h2><p>When humans were less active — what scientists call the anthropause — animals began breeding more and traveling farther. Dolphins whistled longer, birds changed their songs, sea turtles laid more eggs. In some places, predators or invasive species arrived. Urban wildlife that had become accustomed to coexisting with humans (and our trash), like crows or raccoons, retreated. It revealed the ways in which humans both threaten and protect the natural world, scientists said.</p><h2 id="link-67b79a8d">Men do less</h2><p>The lockdowns brought a crush of domestic labor. More dishes piled up, and more needy children were underfoot. But even when men worked from home, women still handled more of the work. Eight in 10 mothers said they managed remote schooling. (Fathers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/upshot/pandemic-chores-homeschooling-gender.html" title="">overestimated</a> their contribution, surveys found.) That’s likely a reason mothers’ antidepressant use increased when schools were closed, but not fathers’. Mothers were also more likely than men to cut back at work — though they returned as soon as they could. Only couples who want egalitarian relationships, researchers wrote, can overcome “the stickiness of gender inequality in household work.”</p><h2 id="link-53d77784">Plants make us happy</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Liana Finck</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>People flocked to natural areas when they could, and they were better off for it. A study in Hong Kong compared people who lived near urban green spaces with those who didn’t. It found that parks provided physical activity and a refuge. A study in nine countries found that access to nature — even a balcony or a garden at home — improved people’s moods. And a study in Taiwan analyzed the “window/wall ratio” in people’s quarantine rooms and found that more windows, especially ones that offered views of vegetation, made them happier.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>There were so many other striking findings — such as how easy it is to lift children out of poverty and how dangerous high heels can be for women. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/11/upshot/covid-lessons.html" title="">Read the whole list here</a>.</p><h2 id="link-29b6a2db">More on the Covid anniversary</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>The Times asked 19 photographers to revisit their most enduring images of the pandemic. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/asia/covid-anniversary-photos.html" title="">See their pictures here</a>.</p></li><li><p>Restructured family dynamics and going makeup-free: Twenty-nine Americans shared <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/10/us/covid-19-changed-people.html" title="">how the pandemic changed their lives</a>, for better and for worse.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-2cf161f">Stock Market</h2><ul><li><p>Wall Street had its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/stock-market-economy-tariffs-recession.html" title="">worst day of the year</a> so far after President Trump suggested that his trade policies could cause a recession.
