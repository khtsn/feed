Kathy Hochul of New York chose Antonio Delgado to be her lieutenant governor in 2022, she had nothing but the highest praise for her new No. 2.</p><p>She said Mr. Delgado, then a rising Black political star who represented a competitive House district, was a “battle-tested campaigner.” She praised his work ethic and said that his ability to “unite communities” would serve her administration’s goals.</p><p>Three years later, their partnership <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/nyregion/antonio-delgado-governor.html" title="">has completely disintegrated</a>. After months of open political warfare with Ms. Hochul, Mr. Delgado said Monday he would challenge her in next year’s Democratic primary.</p><p><em>“</em>People are hurting and New York deserves better leadership,” Mr. Delgado said in an interview. “There’s an absence of bold, decisive, transformational leadership.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That phrase has become the theme for Mr. Delgado’s campaign, the first official challenge to Ms. Hochul, and a message he repeats in a <a href="https://youtu.be/-SUnnVhcgug?si=wtkaHCuw4zT76zdm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video announcing his candidacy</a>.</p><p>He never mentions Ms. Hochul by name in the video, but he suggests that everyday New Yorkers deserve a governor with a vision to fight for them as they face unaffordable housing, child care and health care costs.</p><p>“Listen, the powerful and well-connected have their champions,” Mr. Delgado says in the announcement. “I’m running for governor to be yours.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>There had been widespread speculation that Mr. Delgado, 48, planned to mount a primary challenge to Ms. Hochul. When he <a href="https://x.com/DelgadoforNY/status/1894130426458833001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced in February</a> that he would not seek re-election as her running mate, few raised their eyebrows, because the pair had been at odds for months.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is rare for a lieutenant governor to run against a sitting governor, but Mr. Delgado is known for taking an unconventional path, including with his decision to leave Congress, where he represented a House district in the Hudson Valley, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/nyregion/antonio-delgado-new-york-lieutenant-governor-hochul.html" title="">become Ms. Hochul’s No. 2</a>.</p><p>While polls do appear to show that Ms. Hochul may be vulnerable — 55 percent of registered voters in a <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SNY0525-Crosstabs.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siena College poll last month</a> said they would prefer to elect someone else as governor — Mr. Delgado is still considered a long shot. Ms. Hochul is a fund-raising behemoth who raised a record $60 million during her last election. </p><p>The governor’s poll numbers have also begun to rebound, and Mr. Delgado remains relatively unknown. Almost 60 percent of voters in the Siena College poll had no opinion of him. He would lose to Ms. Hochul 46 percent to 12 percent in a primary contest held now, the survey found.</p><p>Mr. Delgado said he was undeterred by the polling and believed that by running for governor, he was demonstrating his commitment to the people who elected him.</p><p><em>“</em>I haven’t seen a vision,” Mr. Delgado said of Ms. Hochul. “I haven’t seen a decisive leadership that is clear-eyed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>His relationship with the governor began to fray last year as Ms. Hochul was serving as a surrogate for then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Delgado called on him in July to <a href="https://x.com/DelgadoforNY/status/1811117871579234526" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drop his re-election bid</a> after a poor debate performance. The governor responded that she disagreed with Mr. Delgado but that he had a right to voice his opinion.</p><p>In February, Mr. Delgado publicly veered away from Ms. Hochul again to <a href="https://x.com/DelgadoforNY/status/1890192765147099283" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">call for the resignation of Mayor Eric Adams of New York City</a>, who was facing federal corruption charges and accusations that he engaged in a quid pro quo with the Trump administration to have his indictment dismissed.</p><p>Ms. Hochul, facing pressure to remove Mr. Adams from office, issued a sharp rebuke, saying through a spokesman that Mr. Delgado “does not now and has not ever spoken on behalf of this administration.”</p><p>The schism reached its low point in late winter, when Ms. Hochul <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/kathy-hochul-antonio-delgado-primary-challenge-hint/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took Mr. Delgado’s office space</a> and most of his staff. She stripped him of his role as chairman of the state’s regional economic development councils, and confiscated his state-issued electronic devices.</p><p>Mr. Delgado said in the interview he first realized that he would not be part of Ms. Hochul’s decision-making process months after he became lieutenant governor, when she nominated Justice Hector D. LaSalle as the first Latino to lead New York’s highest court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Left-leaning state Democratic leaders worried that Justice LaSalle was too conservative and they warned Ms. Hochul that his nomination likely faced insurmountable opposition. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/nyregion/hector-lasalle-chief-judge-vote.html" title="">He went on to become the first nominee for chief judge</a> to be rejected by the State Senate.</p><p>“The conversation was more or less, here’s who we’re going with,” Mr. Delgado said. He added that the governor’s team also expected him to campaign in support of Justice LaSalle’s nomination, and he refused.</p><p>Aides to Ms. Hochul, meanwhile, felt as though Mr. Delgado did not put in the work needed to be a full governing partner, turning down opportunities to travel statewide and make public appearances.</p><p>Representative Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat, has also indicated he might challenge Ms. Hochul in the primary. Potential Republican challengers include Representatives Mike Lawler and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/elise-stefanik-trump-johnson-cabinet.html" title="">Elise Stefanik</a>, both of whom have signaled that they may run.</p><p>One potential roadblock to Mr. Delgado’s ascension, even some allies concede, is the way he handled his split from the governor, a rare public display of disloyalty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I didn’t agree at first,” Kamal Johnson, the mayor of Hudson, N.Y., said about Mr. Delgado’s breaks with the governor. “But then I thought about it and said, he’s on to something.”</p><p>Mr. Johnson said he respected Ms. Hochul’s leadership, but felt the Democratic Party should focus on candidates who have the potential to serve in higher office and can connect to a younger and more diverse demographic of voters.</p><p>Mr. Delgado, a married father of two, is a former hip-hop artist and Rhodes Scholar who graduated from Harvard Law School.</p><p>He has crisscrossed the state in the lead-up to his announcement. On a recent Sunday, he traveled to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn to attend services at Epiphany Church, where much of the congregation lining up for three packed services were of color and in their 20s.</p><p>“I know all of the drama surrounding him,” said Assemblywoman Stefani Zinerman, who accompanied Mr. Delgado. She said that voters seemed interested in hearing “what he’s been doing and what he wants to do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At the Michelle Obama Community Democratic Club in Harlem, Cordell Cleare, a state senator who founded the club, gave Mr. Delgado an encouraging introduction, though she did not endorse him outright.</p><p>For the next hour, Mr. Delgado answered questions and spoke about his plan to expand public health care, create universal child care, raise the minimum wage and change the way the state finances new housing. He talked about his work in creating New York’s first Office of Service and Civic Engagement to encourage young people to enter public service.</p><p>“This state is run by Democrats — there’s no Republicans impeding our progress,” Mr. Delgado said, as the crowd signaled its agreement. “So we need to start holding up the mirror and having a moment of accountability, and ask ourselves, what are we doing?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeffery C.
