The rain could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/los-angeles-fires-rain-risk-mudslides.html" title="">reduce fire risks and help vegetation</a> parched by the driest start to a rainy season on record in Los Angeles.</p><p>But the National Weather Service also assessed there was a 10 to 20 percent chance of significant mudslides in several Los Angeles County burn scars, sensitive areas where fires devoured trees and brush.</p><p>In the burn scars, the charred soil could act like slick pavement when soaked by rain, creating the conditions for mudslides, said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“You just don’t get any absorption of the water,” Mr. Chenard said. “It just all immediately turns into runoff.”</p><p>The highest intensity rain was expected between 4 p.m. on Sunday and 4 p.m. on Monday, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lox" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the service</a>. Los Angeles and Ventura Counties were expected to get up to an inch of total rainfall, and up to three inches was forecast in the mountains around Los Angeles.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/NWS/status/1883593946246553879" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">burn scars include areas</a> scorched by the Palisades fire in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles; the Hurst fire near the Sylmar area of the city; the Sunset fire near West Hollywood; the Eaton fire near Pasadena; the Hughes fire near Castaic Lake; and the Franklin fire near Malibu, among others.</p><p>Burn scars outside Los Angeles County had a 5 to 10 percent chance of experiencing mudslides, the Weather Service said.</p><p>Residents were urged to stock up on supplies and protect property with sandbags. A flood watch was in effect in Los Angeles County until Monday afternoon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Light rain arrived in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, on Saturday evening, and picked up across the region on Sunday, the service said.</p><p>The system was drifting southeast through Los Angeles County, delivering lightning and hail in some areas, according to the service. Through Sunday afternoon, the highest rates of rainfall — about three-quarters of an inch per hour — were limited to isolated areas.</p><p>Rates over half an inch of rain per hour in the burn scars could pose “some significant issues,” Mr. Chenard warned.</p><p>The Los Angeles region had endured a brutal drought for months, feeding this month’s devastating wildfires, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/26/us/california-wildfires-los-angeles" title="">burned across thousands of acres</a> and displaced more than 100,000 people.</p><p>Before Saturday, there had been no measurable rain in downtown Los Angeles this year, said John Feerick, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. He described the rain as welcome news.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“In general, this is beneficial rain,” Mr. Feerick said. “It should help with the fire situation immensely.”</p><p>“Now, with that comes the risk, because there are burn scars,” he added.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
