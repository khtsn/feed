    <h1>Nebraska Voters Pass Measure Limiting Abortions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A ballot amendment prohibiting abortion beyond the first three months of pregnancy passed in Nebraska, according to The Associated Press, outpolling a competing measure that would have established a right to abortion until fetal viability.</p><p>The state was one of 10 with similar abortion ballot amendments this year, as abortion rights groups looked to capitalize on rising popular support for abortion in the two years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.</p><p>But Nebraska was the only state where anti-abortion activists had sponsored their own measure to try to restrict abortion rights. State officials had said that even if both measures won a majority of votes, the amendment that received more would prevail.</p><p>The measure put forward by abortion rights groups would have protected a “fundamental right” to abortion until viability, the point in pregnancy when a fetus can survive outside the uterus, generally around 24 weeks. The state could have restricted or banned abortion after viability, except when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant woman.</p></div></div>
