The 28-member board came to its decision after more than three hours of debate.</p><p>Mr. Steinley, in a statement sent by his lawyer, called the decision to remove him “a deliberate act of retaliation driven by internal politics,” and promised to “vigorously defend myself” over what he described as “baseless claims.”</p><p>In an article in The Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/realestate/appraisal-institute-sexual-harassment-exam-flaws.html" title="">multiple women said they had been harassed or subject to inappropriate conduct by Mr. Steinley</a>. The Appraisal Institute paid $412,000 in May 2024 to a former employee to privately settle her sexual harassment claim against him and the organization, The Times found.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In an emailed statement, the Appraisal Institute said they made the decision “acting in the best interest” of the group. They added that the allegations in Ms. Chance’s complaint would be “addressed in a court of law.” Craig Capilla, the lawyer for Mr. Steinley, confirmed by text message that his client had been voted out by a two-thirds majority.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Steinley agreed to step away from public duties related to his position and skipped the Leadership Development and Advisory Council, an appraisers’ conference in Washington, D.C., that is a cornerstone of the professional year for appraisers across the country.</p><p>On Facebook, WhatsApp Groups and LinkedIn, some members of the Appraisal Institute protested Mr. Steinley’s move to step away from the organization, saying that skipping public duties wasn’t enough.</p><p>More than 600 members of the organization, which serves as a guidepost for the 70,000 real estate appraisers working in all 50 states, added their names to a petition on Change.org demanding Mr. Steinley’s resignation. At least four local chapters sent letters to the Appraisal Institute and its board of directors, and in WhatsApp groups and across social media, debates over how to move forward played out.</p><p>Mr. Steinley denied the accusations in written responses through Mr. Capilla earlier this month. “Mr. Steinley wholly denies any allegations of any unwanted touching or harassment. It simply did not occur,” Mr. Capilla wrote in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>After Wednesday’s vote, several members were quick to celebrate Mr. Steinley’s ouster.</p><p>“The Appraisal Institute must take these complaints seriously moving forward,” said Elaine Liz-Plowman, an appraiser in Mississippi who has served on the organization’s national board. “This is the first step in the right direction for the Appraisal Institute and its members.”</p><p>The Appraisal Institute, which has 16,000 members and plays a significant role training those who measure the worth of property in the United States, is now facing multiple lawsuits related to Mr. Steinley’s alleged conduct. A former employee, Alissa Akins, is suing the organization for wrongful termination, claiming it fired her from her position as director of education and publications after she exposed potential errors in testing materials and that Mr. Steinley was instrumental in ordering her exit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cindy Chance, a former chief executive of the Appraisal Institute, has sued the trade group and Mr. Steinley, alleging wrongful termination and sexual harassment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alissa Akins, the group’s former director of education and publications, says she was fired after blowing the whistle on errors in the tests used to train and certify appraisers.

He added that an independent investigation into Ms. Chance’s claims was “well underway,” which he said presented “clear evidence” that her claims were “unsubstantiated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Despite these findings, the Institute has chosen to move forward with a course of action that appears more concerned with reputation management and internal power consolidation than with truth or fairness,” he added.</p><p>Ms. Chance called the decision to remove Mr. Steinley a first step toward accountability. “I hope it gives others the courage to speak up about past abuse and misconduct — and to demand a full overhaul of governance at the Appraisal Institute,” she said in a statement.</p><p>Some leaders of the group on Wednesday cautioned members not to celebrate too much, and stressed that Mr. Steinley’s behavior had not occurred in a vacuum. Ryan Hlubb, a commercial appraiser in Pennsylvania who has served on the national board, said deep-seated issues remain in the organization.</p><p>“While Craig Steinley’s removal may appear justified to some given the recent public challenges, this represents a troubling moment for our membership community,” he said. “The organization is poised to fall backward, driven by a controlling class of ‘good old boys’ determined to unravel any semblance of progress.”</p><p>Paula Konikoff, president of the Appraisal Institute, acknowledged those troubles in a letter sent to members Wednesday evening. “I know this has been a painful period for our members and our wider community,” she wrote. “This had become a matter of the well-being and trust of the Appraisal Institute as an organization, which is greater than any one individual.”</p><p>Mr. Steinley is described by his former colleagues as charismatic and flirtatious. He has held a number of appraisal board positions and executive appointments, served as president of the Appraisal Institute in 2023 and until Wednesday was in his second term as the group’s vice president.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
