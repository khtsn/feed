Though the law was enacted in 1977, federal authorities have more heavily enforced it since around 2005, cracking down on bribery, especially in countries where it is a common business practice.</p><p>Mr. Trump has objected to the law, which has led to charges and huge fines against some of the world’s largest companies. In November, U.S. prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/gautam-adani-bribery-charges.html" title="">accused</a> Gautam Adani, the Indian tycoon, of bribing Indian officials and charged him with fraud. His company has called those claims “baseless.”</p><p>Companies that have paid fines under the act include the engineering conglomerate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/business/worldbusiness/15iht-siemens.4.18705043.html" title="">Siemens</a> and the Swedish telecommunications company <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ericsson-plead-guilty-and-pay-over-206m-following-breach-2019-fcpa-deferred-prosecution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ericsson</a>. In 2020, Goldman Sachs agreed to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/goldman-sachs-resolves-foreign-bribery-case-and-agrees-pay-over-29-billion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pay more than $2.9 billion</a> to resolve charges that employees at its Malaysian subsidiary had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/business/goldman-sachs-fraud-guilty-plea.html" title="">paid</a> $1 billion in bribes to foreign officials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The law has been “abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States,” Mr. Trump’s executive order on Monday said, adding that its enforcement was impeding foreign policy objectives.</p><p>The order bars federal authorities from starting any new investigations under the act or enforcing new actions for 180 days. The administration will also review existing investigations launched under the act, it said, to “restore proper bounds” on the law.</p><p>It also directs the attorney general to issue new guidance on how to enforce the act “that promotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources.”</p><p>Enforcement of the act has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/business/global/with-wal-mart-bribery-case-more-attention-on-a-law.html" title="">surged</a> in the past two decades as business has become increasingly globalized. In 2004, there were only two criminal enforcement actions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/business/global/with-wal-mart-bribery-case-more-attention-on-a-law.html" title="">under the act</a>. Last year, there were about 30 such actions by the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/related-enforcement-actions-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justice Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/divisions-offices/division-enforcement/enforcement-topics-initiatives/sec-enforcement-actions-fcpa-cases" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump has been among the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/us/politics/jeff-sessions-anti-bribery.html" title="">critics</a> who have argued that the law’s reach has left American companies at a competitive disadvantage abroad. He said in a 2012 CNBC interview that “the world is laughing at us” for enforcing the law, and in 2017 he nominated Jay Clayton, a lawyer who had expressed skepticism about U.S. antibribery policies, to run the S.E.C.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump wanted to strike down the law in his first term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/economy/trump-bribery-law.html?searchResultPosition=19" title="">according</a> to the book “A Very Stable Genius,” by the Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig. They wrote that, in a 2017 briefing, Mr. Trump told the secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, that the law was “so unfair” to American companies. </p><p>Mr. Trump also told a policy adviser to draft an executive action to repeal the law, they wrote. But the adviser, Stephen Miller, responded that he was skeptical about that plan, and it ultimately did not come to fruition.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Executive Power:</strong> President Trump’s early moves to slash the federal government and expand American territory represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-ideology-power.html">significant ideological swings from his first term</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Courts:</strong> With a compliant Congress and mostly quiet streets, Trump’s opponents are turning to the judicial branch to stop some of his executive orders. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/trump-federal-courts-lawsuits.html">But can the courts keep up?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:</strong> Less than 36 hours after Trump appointed Russell Vought as the consumer bureau’s acting director, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/vought-cfpb-musk-trump.html">he shut its operations</a>, throwing the agency into chaos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Work Force:</strong> One thing lost in the Trump administration’s war on the federal bureaucracy is the collective voice of the employees. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/federal-workers-trump.html">But some have begun to speak out</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The collapse of the aid agency at the hands of Trump and Elon Musk is already leaving gaping holes in vital health care and other services that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/africa/usaid-africa-trump-musk.html">millions of Africans rely on for their survival</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
