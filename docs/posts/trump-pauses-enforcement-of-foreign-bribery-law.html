    <h1>Trump Pauses Enforcement of Foreign Bribery Law</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Trump on Monday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered</a> a pause in the enforcement of a federal law aimed at curbing corruption in multinational companies, saying it creates an uneven playing field for American firms.</p><p>The law, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a>, was enacted in 1977 and makes it illegal for companies that operate in the United States to pay foreign government officials to secure business deals. Federal authorities have used the law to crack down on bribery, especially in countries where it is a common business practice.</p><p>Mr. Trump has objected to the law, which has led to charges against some of the world’s largest companies. In November, U.S. prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/gautam-adani-bribery-charges.html" title="">accused</a> Gautam Adani, the Indian tycoon, of bribing Indian officials and charged him with fraud. His company has called those claims “baseless.” In 2020, Goldman Sachs agreed to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/goldman-sachs-resolves-foreign-bribery-case-and-agrees-pay-over-29-billion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pay more than $2.9 billion</a> to settle charges that employees at its Malaysian subsidiary had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/business/goldman-sachs-fraud-guilty-plea.html" title="">paid</a> $1 billion in bribes to foreign officials.</p><p>The law has been “abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States,” Mr. Trump’s executive order said, adding that its enforcement was impeding foreign policy objectives.</p></div></div>
