Nishad Singh had helped oversee a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ftx-sbf-crypto?page=2v" title="">sweeping conspiracy</a> that erased $8 billion from FTX’s books, plunging the company into bankruptcy, draining customers’ savings and prompting a slew of criminal investigations centered on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/technology/sam-bankman-fried-rise-crash.html" title="">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the founder of FTX.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The younger Mr. Singh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/technology/ftx-guilty-plea-fraud.html#:~:text=Nishad%20Singh%2C%2027%2C%20an%20FTX,laundering%20and%20campaign%20finance%20violations." title="">pleaded guilty</a> to fraud last year. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to be sentenced for his role in FTX’s implosion, making him the third of the company’s top leaders to receive a punishment.</p><p>Each of those cases has illustrated an emotional subplot of the FTX drama: the plight of the conspirators’ parents, a group of wealthy academics and high-achieving immigrants who were heavily involved in their adult children’s lives. Before the crypto exchange failed, they had all lived versions of the upper-middle-class dream, raising children who coasted from selective schools into high-paying jobs. Now they are consumed by sadness and disbelief, struggling to understand how such a fate could have befallen families like theirs.</p><p>“His life is now altered in a way none of us could ever have imagined,” Anu Singh, a psychologist and the mother of Nishad Singh, lamented in a recent filing. The mother of Caroline Ellison, another executive at the crypto business, said she had a hard time reconciling what her daughter had done.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nishad Singh, whose father put his career on hold to focus on his son’s mental health, is set to be sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty to fraud.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I will spend the rest of my life trying to understand how someone as good and selfless in so much of her life could end up in the situation she did,” Sara Fisher Ellison wrote in a filing last month.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Many white-collar defendants are middle-aged executives, with spouses and children of their own. But the conspirators in the FTX case were unusually young — in their mid- or late 20s when they committed their crimes.</p><p>Their parents’ lives have been shattered. Some of them faced enormous legal bills or suffered reputational damage. Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents, the Stanford University law professors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/technology/sbf-parents-ftx-collapse.html" title="">Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried</a>, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-parents-sued.html" title="">sued by</a> FTX’s bankruptcy estate over their financial entanglements with the company. Ms. Ellison’s parents, who both teach economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were harassed online and <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/23/who-are-caroline-ellisons-parents-fraudsters-parents-are-mit-economists/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hounded</a> by the news media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-7"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/business/30ftx-parents-barbara-letter.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/acf4ab7de3ec67f0/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-9"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/business/30ftx-parents-joe-bankman-letter.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f37494bed6e1876e/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Over the past nine months, the parents of Mr. Bankman-Fried, Ms. Ellison and Mr. Singh have written letters to Lewis A. Kaplan, the judge overseeing the FTX case, pleading for leniency for their children. They described the emotional toll of FTX’s collapse, recounting wrenching conversations and endless stress. Ms. Fried said seeing her son in jail had plunged her into indescribable grief.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“I would gladly change places with him if I could,” she wrote.</p></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-13"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/business/30ftx-parents-caroline-defense-memo.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/05e3b0b4e586a3f3/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/technology/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced.html" title="">sentenced</a> to 25 years in prison in March, and Ms. Ellison <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/technology/caroline-ellison-ftx-sentence.html" title="">received</a> a two-year sentence at a hearing last month. After Mr. Singh is sentenced, one other member of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, the FTX co-founder Gary Wang, is scheduled to learn his fate on Nov. 20, with letters from family due about two weeks before his sentencing.</p><p>(A fifth FTX executive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/technology/ftx-ryan-salame-michelle-bond.html" title="">Ryan Salame</a>, was recently sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, but his charges weren’t related to the conspiracy that caused the company to implode.)</p><p>Across those cases, the FTX conspirators benefited from privileges that most criminal defendants lack, said Seth Goertz, a former federal prosecutor in Arizona. They hired top-tier law firms to mount sophisticated defenses featuring empathetic portraits of their lives, anchored by polished parental testimonies.</p><p>“You’re certainly seeing class dynamics in play here,” Mr. Goertz said. “This is not something a defendant who just has access to a public defender could do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The parents of Mr. Bankman-Fried, Ms. Ellison and Mr. Singh declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried started working with Ms. Ellison, Mr. Singh and Mr. Wang in 2018, when he ran a crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, in Berkeley, Calif. All recent college graduates, they bonded over a shared commitment to effective altruism — a philanthropic movement that calls on young people to donate most of their money to charity.</p><p>Ms. Ellison’s parents were skeptical of her life decisions. She ignored the “standard parental advice” to buy a house and avoid storing all her savings on FTX, her father, Glenn Ellison, wrote to the court.</p><p>“I was a bit shocked when the first tax receipt for a charitable contribution a hundred times larger than I would have thought a college student should make arrived in the mail,” Mr. Ellison wrote in a filing last month.</p><p>The elder Mr. Singh had his own doubts about the new crypto venture. His son had quit a job at Facebook to join Alameda, a move that struck him as unwise. But when he toured Alameda’s office, he was impressed.</p><p>“If I was Nishad’s age, I could see being drawn to work there,” he wrote in a filing. “I spoke to Sam for a few minutes and found him to be very bright.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-18"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/business/30ftx-parents-nishad-defense-sentencing.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/0e78952c2ef77803/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Singh, Mr. Wang and Ms. Ellison eventually moved to Hong Kong, where they started FTX. The company became a global phenomenon, turning its top executives into billionaires, at least on paper.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/technology/sbf-parents-ftx-collapse.html" title="">intimately involved</a> in the business. Mr. Bankman helped FTX find its first lawyers and worked on the company’s advocacy efforts in Washington. Ms. Fried, who ran a political donor network in Silicon Valley, advised Mr. Bankman-Fried and Mr. Singh on campaign contributions before the 2022 midterm elections, court filings show.</p><p>Other FTX parents played smaller roles, offering informal guidance and occasionally visiting the Bahamas, where the company relocated in 2021.</p><p>At times, they were completely in the dark about their children’s company. In his letter to the court, Mr. Ellison said he had no idea his daughter had been dating Mr. Bankman-Fried, with whom she had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html" title="">turbulent, multiyear relationship</a>, until a few months before they broke up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“I wish I could offer some insight into how things went so wrong and how she ended up making the decisions she did,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “But we, like many others, were completely blindsided.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Caroline Ellison, a former top executive in Mr. Bankman-Fried’s empire, received a two-year sentence.

Mr. Bankman and Ms. Fried traveled to the Bahamas, where they stayed with their son for a month.</p><p>Mr. Ellison and Ms. Fisher Ellison struggled to reach their daughter. When they finally spoke the day after FTX’s bankruptcy, Ms. Ellison “was in a state I have never seen,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “She just could not stop crying, saying multiple times that she ‘knew.’”</p><p>The elder Mr. Singh had been bracing for bad news. A few days before the bankruptcy, he had gotten a panicked call from his son. “Can you come here?” Nishad Singh had asked. “I’m scared. I need you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>But FTX unraveled too quickly for him to intervene, so he arranged for his son to fly home to the San Francisco Bay Area with his fiancée, who was also an FTX employee, and their dog, Gopher.</p><p>At home, the elder Mr. Singh tried to hold himself together, to stay strong for his family. When Ms. Singh saw their son, she pulled him into an embrace. “I held him as tightly as I could, rocking him back and forth as he wept,” she wrote.</p><p>Over the next year, Gururaj Singh traveled to New York with his son for meetings with prosecutors. All the onetime billionaire wants now is to live a simple and happy life, he told the judge. “To him, this means a renewed focus on family,” the elder Mr. Singh wrote. “On getting married, becoming a father one day.”</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Yaffe-Bellany writes about the crypto industry from San Francisco.
