Six years ago, she started a business, Lemon Zesty, making tote bags and other items printed with sassy images of her own creation.

The company oversees outdoor markets, including in Bryant Park, Columbus Circle and the Union Square Holiday Market, which started in 1993 and is the longest-running market in the city. This year, Urbanspace also coordinated an indoor market at Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street for the first time in its 166-year history.</p><p>The shopping bonanza that is called Black Friday now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/business/what-is-black-friday.html" title="">starts well before</a> Thanksgiving and continues with online sales through Cyber Monday (though, of course, there will be holiday sales up until Christmas). The Saturday that follows Black Friday became known as Small Business Saturday in 2010, and consumers are encouraged to shop at small and local businesses. It’s also one of the core days of the holiday market season, Mr. Shelton said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-6"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Monica Martino makes the vast majority of sales for her business, Lemon Zesty, at winter markets.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Afterward, she’ll “hibernate.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Martino does about 80 to 90 percent of her sales for the year during the holiday markets, so she pours hours of work into gearing up for this exact moment. Whether she’ll experience a Black Friday bump as she has in past years remains to be seen. But, Ms. Martino noted, “everyone in the world comes to this part of town, so I’m expecting it to be busy<em>.”</em></p><p>As soon as this year is over, she’ll “hibernate” for the rest of January before beginning preparations for the 2025 holiday shopping season.</p><p>“The economy matters less than the weather,” Eldon Scott, the president of Urbanspace, said of the outdoor markets. “People tend to come out and want to be at the market.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>For outdoor markets, “the economy matters less than the weather,” said Eldon Scott, the president of Urbanspace. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>They say you’re never fully dressed without a smile — or is it without a hat?</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It was a rainy day in November when Allison Larimore stepped into Ms. Martino’s booth, drawn by her quirky art.</p><p>“It’s my sense of humor, and it reminded me of a friend back home, so I bought her a gift,” Ms. Larimore said.</p><p>Visiting New York from Seattle, Ms. Larimore, a research nurse who also makes handmade surgical scrub caps, said she liked to go in and out of the booths, asking vendors if they were the artists behind the products.</p><p>It “just makes it a little bit more wholesome,” she said. “More important to spend my money there.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Browsing prints at Lemon Zesty ...</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>... and pieces at a jewelry booth.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-61e380ba">A small-business laboratory</h2><p>Holiday markets, commonly held outdoors under twinkling lights, have long provided small businesses with a boost and customers with a festive experience.</p><p>“Shopping around the holidays should be experiential because people are into it,” said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>“Even Santa Claus is an experiential thing,” she said. “The Thanksgiving Day parade, holiday music — it all puts you in the mood.

About 30 percent of them sell food, and the rest are hawking a variety of items made for gifting, including jewelry, socks, handbags, clothing and home goods.</p><p>The number of holiday shops at the park has grown steadily in the 23 years since the market’s inception, said Irene Vagianos Whelan, the vice president of brand partnerships and events at Bryant Park.</p><p>Most of the shops are small businesses, she said, noting that many owners even started their businesses at the park. Bank of America, which teams up with the park to host the annual winter extravaganza, gives four minority-owned businesses with under $1 million in revenue<em> </em>rent-free spaces in the market for two weeks during its peak season.</p><p>“We really try to launch their business,” Ms. Vagianos Whelan said. “We’ve had a couple of them turn into real vendors in the market.”</p><p>Rent varies for the other vendors, she said, but everybody is generally on a percentage deal, “so if the vendor does well, we do well. If the vendor doesn’t do well, they don’t suffer.” (Neither she nor Urbanspace would offer specifics about rent or entry costs.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>About 200 vendors sell in Bryant Park.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lisa Devo, a co-owner of the Soap &amp; Paper Factory and a Bryant Park veteran, said she enjoyed the market’s human touch.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Lisa Devo, a co-owner of the Soap &amp; Paper Factory, which is based in Nyack, N.Y., has sold her fragrant wares at holiday markets for years.

It’s so nice, and they want to see us succeed, and they want to support local business<em>.”</em></p><p>Holiday markets make up about 20 percent of her sales for the year, Ms. Devo said, giving her the space to experiment with new items.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“It is very, very helpful for me to be here and look at what people are asking for, and talk to people about what they want,” she said.
