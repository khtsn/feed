Just so impressed with him, the way he carried himself and how he served our country.” “President Carter was the very first president that I recall being inaugurated. We were in the first grade, and I remember our teacher having us, say, ‘You’re going to watch this. Watch the new president.’ And it was a unique time as I got older because I recognized Jimmy Carter was exactly what the country needed coming off the Watergate scandal. So for Carter to come along with the level of integrity that he demonstrated in every area of his life, he was just what the country needed at the time.” “He wasn’t necessarily looked on as the best president when I was growing up, but the things he did after the presidency and the way he worked to help people, and his character through it all during the presidency and after, and how he comported himself.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/08dc-carter-mourners1-gcpj/08dc-carter-mourners1-gcpj-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Visitors said their final goodbyes to Jimmy Carter, lying in state at the Capitol, and reflected on what the former president meant to them.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kent Nishimura for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maya-c-miller"><img alt="Maya C.

Children and adults alike lumbered into the Capitol dressed in insulated snow pants and clunky winter boots. No celebrities, sports stars or internet icons made appearances in the Rotunda, as they have for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/bush-capitol-visitors.html" title="">previous presidents</a>.</p><p>But President-elect Donald J.

During a trip to the United States to celebrate Mr. Schreiner’s 50th birthday, they had been attending a Washington Commanders football game on Dec. 29 when they learned that Mr. Carter had died. Then winter weather delayed their flight back home until Thursday, and the couple decided to head to the Capitol to pay their respects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’s a special moment. It’s hard to describe — it’s incredible to be a part of all this,” Mr. Schreiner said. “He was a special man, and it’s an honor to be here right now to give him the last honor.”</p><p>As well-wishers slowly processed around the coffin, some wiping tears and others somberly bowing their heads, a near silence gripped the cavernous and echoey hall under the Capitol dome, which is usually awash with noise from tourists and frenzied staffers. Only the shutters of cameras, yelps from agitated children and the occasional cough or stray cellphone alert broke the hush.</p><p>The solemn ritual in the Capitol was a prelude to Mr. Carter’s state funeral on Thursday morning at Washington National Cathedral, which the four living presidents will attend and where President Biden is scheduled to deliver a eulogy.</p><p>Throughout the day on Wednesday, several members of Congress passed through the Rotunda to pay tribute, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the former Republican leader, and Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a Democrat and one of the Senate’s first female combat veterans, who offered a salute.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Mitch McConnell was among the lawmakers who passed through the Rotunda on Wednesday to pay tribute. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Becky Carter, the president’s daughter-in-law, arrived on Wednesday afternoon to shake hands with mourners and thank them for coming.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“God bless you,” one of them told her.</p><p>Carlos Del Toro, the secretary of the Navy, stood in silence as he honored Mr. Carter, a Naval Academy graduate and veteran submariner, before laying a hand on his flag-draped coffin. Thomas Donilon, who worked for Mr. Carter and served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, also stopped by to pay his respects.</p><p>Most who came to the Capitol to mourn Mr. Carter were not old enough to remember his presidency. But many lauded his legacy as a humanitarian and pointed to him as an example of decency and humility in a world racked with incivility.</p><p>Shermanda Williams of Maryland, who came with her two sons, said she had brought them to teach them about “having the heart for humanity,” as the former president did.</p><p>“That was very, very important to come and show our respect,” Ms. Williams said, “and to let them see that someone who is kind and gentle and concerned about others can be successful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Her younger son, 11-year-old Kellen, chose to come to the Capitol even though he could have enjoyed a free day at home since school was canceled because of the winter weather.</p><p>“Jimmy Carter was a great man,” he said. “With all his decisions, he was not going to make everybody happy, but he made as many people happy as he could. Because nobody — no country — is perfect, so he did all he could.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
