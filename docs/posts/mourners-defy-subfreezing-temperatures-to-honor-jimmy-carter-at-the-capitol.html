Just so impressed with him, the way he carried himself and how he served our country.” “President Carter was the very first president that I recall being inaugurated. We were in the first grade, and I remember our teacher having us, say, ‘You’re going to watch this. Watch the new president.’ And it was a unique time as I got older because I recognized Jimmy Carter was exactly what the country needed coming off the Watergate scandal. So for Carter to come along with the level of integrity that he demonstrated in every area of his life, he was just what the country needed at the time.” “He wasn’t necessarily looked on as the best president when I was growing up, but the things he did after the presidency and the way he worked to help people, and his character through it all during the presidency and after, and how he comported himself.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/08/multimedia/08dc-carter-mourners1-gcpj/08dc-carter-mourners1-gcpj-threeByTwoLargeAt2X.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Visitors said their final goodbyes to Jimmy Carter, lying in state at the Capitol, and reflected on what the former president meant to them.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kent Nishimura for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maya-c-miller"><img alt="Maya C.
