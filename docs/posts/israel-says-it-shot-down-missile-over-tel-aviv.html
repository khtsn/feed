    <h1>Israel Says It Shot Down Missile Over Tel Aviv</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Israeli military said its air force had struck the launcher from which the missile was fired, in Nafakhiyeh in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Since the war in Gaza broke out last October, Israel and Hezbollah have been trading attacks across Israel’s northern border, driving tens of thousands of people from their homes in the country’s north.</p><p>But Tel Aviv in central Israel has been largely sheltered from the conflict even as tensions escalated just tens of miles to the north and to the south. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah/northern-israel-braces-for-a-backlash-even-as-the-conflict-remains-under-the-radar-in-tel-aviv?smid=url-share" title="">As recently as Saturday</a>, families were flocking to beaches and businesses were bustling in the city, 70 miles from the border with Lebanon.</p><p>Since Sunday, Hezbollah has launched more than 500 missiles, rockets and drones into Israel, most of which were intercepted, appearing undeterred by a string of attacks by Israel on the group last week.</p><p>Hezbollah, which many analysts consider the most powerful of the Iranian proxy groups and the biggest military threat to Israel, has spent years building military capacity since its war with Israel in 2006. The group is estimated to possess between 120,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles.</p></div></div>
