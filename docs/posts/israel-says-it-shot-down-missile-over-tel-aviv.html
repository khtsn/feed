Air raid sirens sent residents fleeing into shelters in the early morning hours. Magen David Adom, Israel’s main emergency medical organization, said it had not received calls regarding injuries.</p><p>Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group based in Lebanon, said in a statement that it had launched a ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, in the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The group said the attack was in retaliation for the assassination of its leaders and the explosion of pagers that incapacitated many of its members.</p><p>Those attacks last week targeting Hezbollah leaders were followed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-deaths.html" title="">a barrage of Israeli airstrikes</a> against the group in Lebanon since Monday, killing more than 500 people, according to Lebanese authorities. The attacks have brought the two sides closer to all-out war than ever before.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Israeli military said its air force had struck the launcher from which the missile was fired, in Nafakhiyeh in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Since the war in Gaza broke out last October, Israel and Hezbollah have been trading attacks across Israel’s northern border, driving tens of thousands of people from their homes in the country’s north.</p><p>But Tel Aviv in central Israel has been largely sheltered from the conflict even as tensions escalated just tens of miles to the north and to the south. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/21/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah/northern-israel-braces-for-a-backlash-even-as-the-conflict-remains-under-the-radar-in-tel-aviv?smid=url-share" title="">As recently as Saturday</a>, families were flocking to beaches and businesses were bustling in the city, 70 miles from the border with Lebanon.</p><p>Since Sunday, Hezbollah has launched more than 500 missiles, rockets and drones into Israel, most of which were intercepted, appearing undeterred by a string of attacks by Israel on the group last week.</p><p>Hezbollah, which many analysts consider the most powerful of the Iranian proxy groups and the biggest military threat to Israel, has spent years building military capacity since its war with Israel in 2006. The group is estimated to possess between 120,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victoria Kim is a reporter based in Seoul and focuses on breaking news coverage across the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">More about Victoria Kim</a></span></p></div><div><p>Gabby Sobelman is a reporter and researcher, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs, based in Rehovot, Israel.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gabby-sobelman">More about Gabby Sobelman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
