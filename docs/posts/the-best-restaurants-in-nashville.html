On the one hand, you have fried green tomatoes, lettuces tossed with hot ham fat, and chicken and dumplings served directly from their cast iron pot. On the other, you have top-of-the-line ingredients — tomatoes and watermelon, Bucksnort trout and lion’s mane mushrooms — inspiring leaps of imagination that veer toward the avant-garde. That is the terrain covered at Audrey, the flagship restaurant Mr. Brock named after his grandmother. The food braids together supposedly opposing impulses — the sincere and nostalgic versus the resourcefully inventive — in a restaurant that is sedate, stylish and comfortable with its own gravitas. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>809 Meridian Street; 615-988-3263; <a href="https://www.audreynashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">audreynashville.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victoria Quirk</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Bad Idea may well be what many seasoned diners thought when they heard there was a wine bar specializing in envelope-pushing Lao food opening inside an East Nashville church. But given the level of cooking here, the name turned out to be a self-aware joke, rather than a self-own. The concept coheres in the hands of the owner, Alex Burch, a seasoned sommelier and first-time restaurateur. He had the good sense to bring on Colby Rasavong as executive chef. A former top lieutenant to Sean Brock, Mr. Rasavong grew up working in his Laotian family’s Thai restaurant and invests the weight of his life experience in food that stretches the boundaries of Southeast Asian cooking to the edge of Appalachia. And the wine list is wise beyond this restaurant’s years, mixing tantalizing obscurities, affordable crowd pleasers and connoisseur selections you’ll rarely find poured by the glass. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>1021 Russell Street; 629-729-4332; <a href="https://www.badideanashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">badideanashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-53ef09ba"><a href="https://www.bastionnashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bastion</a></h2><p>Wedgewood-Houston | Tasting Menu</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victoria Quirk</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At Bastion, there are two sides to the coin: one, a boisterous drinking establishment with a laid-back vibe and impeccable cocktails, and the other, an intimate fine-dining restaurant with a multicourse tasting menu. And, they share a bathroom. On the fine dining side, overseen by the chef Josh Habinger, a menu of imaginative dishes is prepared by chatty, enthusiastic chefs with eagle eyes and attention to detail. Succulent agnolotti filled with merguez spiced lamb rested in a pool of sherry brown butter sauce. One dish is an absolute bonanza of potato products featuring potato mochi bathed in whey sauce and showered with wavy bonito shavings. When dinner is done, stop in at the “Big Bar,” as the rowdy side is called, for a nightcap and a dose of cool. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>434 Houston Street, Suite 110; 615-490-8434; <a href="https://www.bastionnashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bastionnashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-3b03b38"><a href="https://www.boltonsfamous.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolton’s Famous Hot Chicken &amp; Fish</a></h2><p>East Nashville | Soul Food</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Berkey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Hot chicken, a Nashville specialty, is fried chicken so spicy it can literally cause you pain. (According <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/04/the-family-business-that-put-nashville-hot-chicken-on-the-map" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to legend</a>, that was actually the intention of the chef who invented it.) Bolton’s is no exception, particularly if you order it medium, hot or extra hot, which the staff strongly advises against. In a city where restaurants specializing in hot chicken have become a cliché, Bolton’s is a bit of an odd bird for two reasons: No. 1 it’s a friendly neighborhood restaurant with roots (it opened in the 1990s) that predate the hot chicken craze and No. 2 the best dish is arguably the fried catfish. Order it mild, which, truth be told, is still pretty spicy. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>624 Main Street; 615-254-8015; <a href="https://www.boltonsfamous.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boltonsfamous.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mayter Scott</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>What should one expect at an establishment that bills itself as a “bread house and wine bar,” anyway? The husband and wife duo of Benjamin and Katie Rose Tyson dreamed up a restaurant featuring this ideal pairing of food groups after they got married. Mr. Tyson is a fine dining chef while Ms. Tyson’s experience is in wine and beverages. Thus, their marriage spawned Butterlamp, a casual but chic wine bar with dishes that reveal complex layers of flavor and technique below an unassuming surface. Plump mussels sit atop an umami oyster emulsion on konbu bread. Pork fat fries bring a deeply porky flavor, cut with a dollop of creamy spicy aioli. An entire section of chilled reds by the glass leads drinkers down a refreshing rabbit hole of choices. And don’t miss the gobsmackingly good vanilla ice cream made from milk steeped with herbs and vanilla beans that have been grilled over a live fire. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>1101 Chapel Avenue, No. 103; no phone; <a href="https://www.butterlampnashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">butterlampnashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-19452"><a href="https://www.choynashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Choy</a></h2><p>Capitol View | Chinese American, Southern</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Dorio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Arriving in Nashville by way of California is becoming a new normal in Music City. Take Choy, a contemporary Chinese restaurant that opened in the bustling Gulch in July. The menu is a Tennessee-influenced echo of the food at the chef Brandon Jew’s San Francisco restaurant, <a href="https://www.misterjius.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mister Jiu’s</a>, brought to town by that restaurant&#39;s former executive sous chef and a Tennessee native, Brian Griffin. Mr. Griffin is taking the intricate, bold flavors of San Francisco’s Chinatown and incorporating Southern ingredients. The oil-blanched green beans gain bold flavor from fermented black beans and country ham, while a whole-fried flounder is accompanied by green tomatoes, jalapeño and fermented kohlrabi. The exceptional wine list, curated by Justin Mueller, completes the journey from California, with many hard-to-find Napa wines — most of which pair perfectly with the deep brown roast duck that comes with duck liver mousse, homemade pancakes and peanut butter hoisin. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>121B 12th Avenue North; 615-696-7353; <a href="https://www.choynashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">choynashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-68166b32"><a href="https://cityhousenashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">City House</a></h2><p>Germantown | Italian</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William DeShazer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Can pizza be Southern? Can Italian food? The answer is a resounding yes, at least when you’re eating at City House. The restaurant, opened by the chef Tandy Wilson in 2007, helped blaze a trail for the pizzeria-as-Italian-American-trattoria at a time when the Germantown neighborhood, now teeming with businesses, was relatively sleepy. It also showed how well Southern ingredients and recipes take to Italian cuisine, with dishes like cavatelli pesto dotted with field peas and cornmeal crusted trout with salsa verde. If it’s tomato season in Tennessee, keep an eye out for a pie inspired by Mr. Tandy’s mother’s favorite tomato sandwich, or one holding morsels of the juicy peaches that ripen around the same time. And always save room for the pastry chef Rebekah Turshen’s refined, down-to-earth desserts. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>1222 Fourth Avenue North; 615-736-5838; <a href="http://cityhousenashville.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cityhousenashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-5b0d5e0"><a href="https://edessarestauranttn.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edessa</a></h2><p>South Nashville | Kurdish</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Any meal at this Kurdish restaurant should begin with an assortment of dips, ideally including the walnut-studded haydari, along with savory baked items like lavash, which comes straight from the oven, filled with hot air and covered in sesame seeds, and the spinach-and-cheese stuffed gozleme flatbread. From there, you’ll have to make some hard choices. Pide, stuffed cabbage and magnificent lamb stew poured straight from its clay pot? You’ll definitely want a mixed grill of kebabs and an order of cig kofte, the spicy, inscrutably delicious bulgur wheat balls. Yes, it’s a lot of food, so bring friends. That’s what everyone else seems to do at this convivial restaurant in the Little Kurdistan section of Nashville, home to the country’s largest Kurdish population. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>3802 Nolensville Pike; 615-837-2567; <a href="http://edessarestauranttn.net" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edessarestauranttn.net</a></p><h2 id="link-29ac7f73"><a href="https://www.ellistonplacesodashop.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elliston Place Soda Shop</a></h2><p>Midtown | Southern</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William DeShazer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>As any Nashvillian knows, this isn’t just the home of hot chicken; it’s also a town long fueled by the meat-and-three, a plate lunch consisting of, well, a meat and three sides. The Elliston Place Soda Shop is one of the original and finest of the genre, having offered its fried chicken, whipped potatoes, squash casserole and turnip greens since 1939. Despite a recent move — just next door, and bringing along its red leather booths and soda counter — the Soda Shop has maintained its heart, soul and legion of regulars who pack in for old-fashioned milkshakes, banana splits and slices of Linda Melton’s pies. Known as “the pie lady,” Ms. Melton has spent more than 30 years shepherding along the heart and soul of the Soda Shop. Given its sturdy new digs, that heart promises to keep beating. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>2105 Elliston Place; 615-219-2704; <a href="https://www.ellistonplacesodashop.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ellistonplacesodashop.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-1ae2e"><a href="https://www.goodasfolk.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Folk</a></h2><p>East Nashville | Italian</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Behrends</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Every neighborhood needs a restaurant like Folk, where it feels like no one is trying too hard, though the food and service are impeccable. Warm paper lanterns hang high above the cozy, bustling dining room in East Nashville, and vegetable-forward dishes tease out the best of each season. Yes, the chef Philip Krajeck’s more laid-back follow-up to his first restaurant, <a href="https://www.rolfanddaughters.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rolf and Daughters</a>, is easy to love. A massive chicken Milanese consistently retains a place on the menu, shifting its accouterments from paper-thin slices of green tomatoes with salsa verde to piperade jus and herbs as summer wanes. Pizzas with bubbled and blistered crusts are also a constant, particularly the signature clam pie studded with littlenecks and bonito flakes. Cocktails lean Italian, as do the wines, which include elegant old-world pours and funky orange wines from newer producers alike. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>823 Meridian Street; 615-610-2595;<a href="https://www.goodasfolk.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">goodasfolk.com</a></p><h2 id="link-2f5f715"><a href="https://www.henriettared.com/menu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Henrietta Red</a></h2><p>Germantown | Seafood, Eclectic</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emily Dorio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>These days, Nashville’s landlocked situation is no longer an obstacle for seafood-loving diners and chefs. That’s certainly the case for Julia Sullivan, a Nashville native who has spent time in the kitchens of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/dining/pete-wells-per-se-review.html" title="">Per Se</a> and <a href="https://www.bluehillfarm.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blue Hill at Stone Barns</a>. Here, her menu focuses on the fruits of the sea. A raw bar stocked with oysters from the coasts — including the Gulf — is a focal point of the dining room. Don’t miss Poppy’s caviar, an amped up onion dip that’s topped with Tennessee paddlefish caviar. Named after the chef’s grandparents, Henrietta Red manages to surface of-the-moment flavors with the underpinnings of simple, Southern fare. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>1200 4th Avenue North; 615-490-8042; <a href="https://www.henriettared.com/menu" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">henriettared.com</a></p><h2 id="link-3063fa"><a href="https://www.iggysnashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Iggy’s</a></h2><p>Wedgewood-Houston | Italian</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Iggy’s is a pasta-centric Italian place whose most famous dish is garlic bread. How such a conventional-sounding restaurant could also rank among Nashville’s best is easy to understand once you try that bread: a glistening brioche, baked pretzel-brown, with sweet, molten creamy cheese at its center. The co-owner Ryan Poli is a former executive chef at <a href="https://www.thecatbirdseatrestaurant.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Catbird Seat</a>, Nashville’s standout tasting menu restaurant, which recently reopened with a new chef after a brief hiatus. That pedigree helps explain how a restaurant that serves nothing you haven’t seen before — fusilli alla vodka, rigatoni Bolognese, cacio e pepe<strong> —</strong> could also be (like the garlic bread) unforgettable. It helps that the food is modest enough to share the stage with wines worthy of equal billing. Iggy’s concise, worldly list was written by Mr. Poli’s brother and partner, Matthew, a gifted sommelier. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>609 Merritt Avenue; 615-645-9949; <a href="http://iggysnashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iggysnashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-f674821"><a href="https://www.im2nashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Market</a></h2><p>Belmont | Asian</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mary Craven</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>The struggle of old versus new is seamlessly resolved at International Market, the Thai market and restaurant that has been thriving on Belmont Boulevard since 1975. That’s when Win and Patti Myint opened the doors to Thai food in Nashville, offering this city its first tastes of pad Thai and more. The restaurant’s steam table lunch became a fixture, as did the hospitality of the Myints. Now the restaurant is in the hands of the new generation, the siblings Arnold and Anna Myint. Mr. Myint, a former <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/dining/top-chef-season-20.html" title="">“Top Chef” contestant</a>, works to expand the understanding of the cuisine as a whole, bringing modern takes to family dishes.

The result is an austere restaurant that feels like a refuge, staffed by unrushed employees executing a concise menu of only good options. They include housemade udon, onigiri and salads bursting with fresh produce, as well as inari that eat like cool shrimp-roll sliders, with tofu in place of the bun. Truth is, there isn’t a neighborhood that wouldn’t be richer for the addition of this soulful, personal take on a Japanese teahouse. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>747 Douglas Avenue; no phone; <a href="http://kisserrestaurant.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kisserrestaurant.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-39"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Thomas Lee</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>Dining at Locust is like a field trip into the constantly churning, chaotic mind of the Irish-born chef Trevor Moran, whose restaurant opened during the peak of the pandemic in 2020. Since then, like the world around it, the restaurant has evolved greatly. It shifted from its original conception as a dumpling shop to its current iteration, serving dishes like beef tartare wrapped in nori and swordfish in the style of Nashville hot chicken. The fish is possibly the freshest in town, with the chef and his team performing weekly sprints to the airport to retrieve tuna bellies from Japan, or briny Belon oysters from the Irish coast. The restaurant’s dining format will undoubtedly change again soon, as will its menu. One constant? The enthusiastically loud playlists that feature the crew’s favorite albums, from metal to ’90s hip-hop. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>2305 12th Avenue South; no phone; <a href="http://locustnashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">locustnashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-4bbc4043"><a href="https://www.martinsbbqjoint.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Martin’s Bar-B-Que Joint</a></h2><p>Downtown | Barbecue</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-41"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Thomas Lee</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>Nashville is a Southern town with the Southern urge to eat smoked meats.

The whole hog is smoky, pulled and chopped and mixed to include every morsel of pork flavor. The brisket is tender, the jalapeño Cheddar sausage is spicy and everything that comes out of the kitchen is kissed by smoke. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>410 Fourth Avenue South; 615-288-0880; <a href="https://www.martinsbbqjoint.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">martinsbbqjoint.com</a></p><h2 id="link-1ae13"><a href="https://www.nokonashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Noko</a></h2><p>East Nashville | Pan-Asian</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>Noko’s menu cherry-picks from across Asia to assemble a menu of dishes you probably already love, even if you haven’t seen them offered all in the same place, or in precisely this form. There is a peppy hamachi crudo, an assortment of bao buns and a long list of dishes enriched by contact with wood fire or a hot metal wok, from shishitos and Sichuan green beans to Wagyu brisket and a smoky half-chicken in wasabi-spiked white sauce. The restaurant’s chef, Dung Vo, who opened Noko last year with his partners Jon Murray and Wilson Brannock, has a knack for knowing what will please a crowd in East Nashville, circa now. That will be made clear by the first thing you’ll notice about the place: how hard it is to get a reservation. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>701 Porter Road; 615-712-6894; <a href="http://nokonashville.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nokonashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-703527e5"><a href="https://peninsulanashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peninsula</a></h2><p>East Nashville | Spanish</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-46"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryson Hatfield</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p>The food at Peninsula is shrouded in an air of mystery, beginning with a purposefully vague menu that reads — as is the style at many restaurants — like a haphazard grocery list (“octopus, tamarind, yeast”). A plate will arrive featuring those ingredients, though in exactly what configuration remains an enigma until finally the flavors are revealed bite by bite. The chef Jake Howell’s alchemic approach to ingredients, combined with influences of Basque and Iberian cuisine, results in a singular style that has no real boundaries. Along with his partners, Yuriko Say and Craig Schoen, Mr. Howell has created a restaurant that is both personal and global. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>1035 West Eastland Avenue; 615-679-0377; <a href="https://peninsulanashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peninsulanashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-33285a3c"><a href="https://www.liveinthepresenttense.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Present Tense</a></h2><p>Wedgewood-Houston | Japanese, Eclectic</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-48"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nathan Zucker</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p>For the grammar fans out there, it’s true: Present Tense encapsulates what’s happening in Nashville right now. Which is to say, an influx of talent, including the chef Ryan Costanza, who came to Nashville from San Diego. Along with his partner and general manager, Rick Margaritov, Mr. Costanza has made a mark in the burgeoning Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood. An absolutely wild dish of squid ink noodles with rings of tender squid lashed with spice from ’nduja and wasabi proved impossible to resist. Other, more minimalist dishes also exceed expectations, particularly roasted Japanese sweet potatoes adorned simply with cream and sprigs of lovage. Drinks from Kenneth Vanhooser are lush and balanced, showcasing more of Nashville’s continuously growing cocktail scene, and the interest in pairing craft drinks well with food. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>301 Hart Street; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=present+tense+nashville&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1087US1087&amp;oq=present+tense+nashville&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDwgAEAAYQxjjAhiABBiKBTIPCAAQABhDGOMCGIAEGIoFMhIIARAuGEMYrwEYxwEYgAQYigUyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyDQgGEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyBggHEEUYQNIBCDMzNzBqMGo0qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">629-231-4006</a>; <a href="https://www.liveinthepresenttense.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">liveinthepresenttense.com</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p>Fried fish, when done well, is one of life’s greatest pleasures.

At Red Perch, both pleasure and revelations are on offer. It’s a restaurant that bears revisiting often, to satisfy a craving for tender, crispy fish or a simple plate of salty anchovies in good olive oil. A very good burger sometimes appears on the menu, as does paella, or a bánh mi with shatteringly crisp fried shrimp on a toasted baguette. This is what happens when a fine-dining chef follows his dream: in this case the dream belongs to the Australian chef Cameron Payne, whose time at the vaunted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/dining/chef-ben-shewry-melbourne-attica-restaurant.html" title="">Attica</a> proved to be a perfect finishing school for opening a truly exceptional fish-and-chip shop in Nashville. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>4101 Charlotte Avenue, G120; 615-964-7104; <a href="https://redperch.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">redperch.com</a></p><h2 id="link-48a910cf"><a href="https://www.silversandsnashville.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Silver Sands</a></h2><p>North Nashville | Soul Food</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-54"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William DeShazer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><div><p>“This is how we ate coming up” is the kind of thing you hear in the line that curves from the steam table through the dining room at Silver Sands. A few examples of “this” include saucy beef tips, stewed whole okra spears and fried-to-order whiting and catfish. Sophia Vaughn, the chef and owner of Silver Sands, was preceded in the kitchen of this landmark meat-and-three by her mother and aunt. She wakes up well before dawn to start cooking soul food that is consistently satisfying and often more than that. The salmon croquettes and hot water cornbread (imagine Johnny cakes crossed with gougères) are among the dishes that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the fancy restaurants downtown. <em>BRETT ANDERSON</em></p><p>937 Locklayer Street; 615-780-9900; <a href="http://silversandsnashville.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">silversandsnashville.com</a></p><h2 id="link-a8c6d4c"><a href="https://www.sperrys.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sperry’s Restaurant</a></h2><p>Belle Meade | Steakhouse</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-56"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">William DeShazer for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p>In a town filled with steakhouses, Sperry’s stands out for the warm patina it has acquired during its 50 years on the edge of Nashville’s upscale Belle Meade neighborhood. There are renowned steaks, including one stuffed with blue cheese as wrapped in bacon, known as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/prince-william" title="">Prince William</a>” after the royal ordered it on a 2002 visit. But there is also a copious salad bar, purportedly the first in Nashville (and it may well be the last). The dark, moody interior conjures an English country tavern, where photos of horses and hunting hounds mingle pleasantly with dark wood beams to perhaps remind diners of a time when fine dining had a different meaning. Do not skip the <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017148-bananas-foster" title="">bananas Foster</a>, which are the star of the show each night, served tableside, the impressive flames drawing the rapt attention of the entire dining room. <em>ELLEN FORT</em></p><p>5109 Harding Pike; 615-353-0809; <a href="https://www.sperrys.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sperrys.com</a></p><h2 id="link-35d57c"><a href="https://www.ssgainash.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">S.S.

In reality, you can’t lose. Both versions deliver handsomely browned birds, their surfaces covered with flecks of fried shallots and garlic. However you deploy the accompanying sauces — one vinegar-based, the other fish sauce-based, both spicy — the chicken makes for rapturous, messy eating, as was certainly the case when Chris and Emma Biard encountered the chicken that inspired S.S. Gai on a honeymoon trip to Thailand. Their business is found in the Wash, a former East Nashville carwash that has been converted into an outdoor food hall filled with food entrepreneurs polishing their ideas. When you consider its equally flavorful snacks and pounded salads, S.S.

Dining at Tailor is like an invitation to Mr. Surti’s home, albeit a home with a kitchen full of top flight kitchen equipment and highly trained chefs. Each dish represents Mr. Surti’s passion for sharing his South Asian heritage and Nashville upbringing on the same plate: A classic Southern tomato sandwich features juicy heirlooms slathered with crunchy masala aioli, and a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024745-pani-puri" title="">pani puri</a> is filled with chunks of watermelon and its juice.

It’s all a fever dream from the minds of husband-and-wife duo Joshua Walker and Duolan Li, whose eclectic style guides the menu and the buzzy vibes. Those noodles are topped with brisket, while a luxurious Thai-style fried rice is spicy and buttery and topped with a mountain of lump crab.
