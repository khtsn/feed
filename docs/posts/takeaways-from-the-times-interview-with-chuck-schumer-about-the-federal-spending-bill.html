Schumer is facing the biggest revolt from Democrats in years, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/magazine/chuck-schumer-interview.html" title="">in a conversation with The Interview</a> after his crucial vote supporting a Republican federal spending bill this past week, he tried to brush off questions about whether he should step aside. Democratic officials appeared stunned when Schumer did an about-face on the spending bill, arguing that the choice was the lesser of two evils. Schumer defended his decision in the second part of our wide-ranging interview, even as questions over his leadership by senior party officials continued.</p><p>Here are three takeaways from the shutdown portion of our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/magazine/chuck-schumer-interview.html" title="">conversation</a>.</p><h2 id="link-133d5d35">Schumer explained that he cast his vote to prevent further decimation of the government by DOGE and Trump.</h2><p>Schumer said that he made a “very, very difficult” decision to support the Republican bill in order to avert a government shutdown that, he said, President Trump and Elon Musk wanted. He called Trump and Musk “anti-government fanatics” and “nihilists.”</p><p>They want to shutter “agency after agency,” he said, which would create a situation far worse than the Republican bill. He continued:<span>  </span></p><blockquote><p>Two days from now in a shutdown, they could say, well, food stamps for kids is not essential. It’s gone. All veterans offices in rural areas are gone. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. They’re not essential. We’re cutting them back. So it’d be horrible. The damage they can do under a shutdown is much worse than any other damage that they could do.</p><p><strong>Isn’t this just — </strong>Wait, let me just finish, Lulu. It can last forever. There is no off ramp. One of the Republican senators told us: We go to a shutdown, it’s going to be there for six months, nine months, a year. And by then, their goal of destroying the federal government would be gone. And finally, one final point here, and that is that right now under the C.R., you can go to court and contest an executive order to shut something down. Under a shutdown, the executive branch has sole power.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-41c901b2">He acknowledged that he and Hakeem Jeffries haven’t spoken since the vote.</h2><p>While he accepted that there were “divisions” within his party around his vote, he insisted that he and his fellow Democrats have a respect for each other and that they are united in their fight against Trump.</p><p>Schumer reluctantly acknowledged that he and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, who talk often, have not spoken since Schumer’s surprising vote, suggesting that there is a rupture between the two most senior Democrats in Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is that portion of our exchange:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Hakeem Jeffries seemed to throw you under the bus on Friday. He was asked directly if he thought you should be replaced as leader, and he very pointedly refused to answer that question. Have you spoken to Jeffries since the vote? </strong>I speak to Jeffries regularly.</p><p><strong>Have you spoken to him since the vote? </strong>He and I have a good relationship. We speak all the time.</p><p><strong>But have you spoken since the vote? </strong>No, we haven’t spoken since the vote, but we speak all the time. We speak regularly, and we have a good, close relationship.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3d9af592">He thinks he’s still the right leader for the party.</h2><p>The divisions in the party about how to face down Donald Trump exploded into view with<span>  </span>Schumer’s vote, placing his leadership into jeopardy.</p><p>In both conversations with me, Schumer made clear that, despite broad concerns from some that Democrats are operating with an old playbook, and specific concerns about his own leadership surrounding the shutdown vote, he’s still the right person to be Senate minority leader. In our first conversation, he said that he sees himself as “sort of like an orchestra leader,” and when pressed on this in our second conversation, he dismissed the idea that he wasn’t the man for the job, saying “We are a united and strong caucus fighting against Trump.”</p><p>Furious Democrats have even called for fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to challenge Schumer in the next primary. When I pointed out that Schumer had been a leading voice in calls for Biden to step down, and asked if it was time for him to step down, he insisted that the Democrats were in a “spirited disagreement.” </p><blockquote><p><strong>Senator, you were crucial in getting President Joe Biden to step down. Do you think it’s time for you to do the same? </strong>Let me say this: There is spirited disagreement on which was the right vote. But as I said, I think we have mutual respect in our caucus, and we are all united, no matter how people voted on this vote, to continue fighting Trump. We are a united and strong caucus fighting against Trump. We disagreed on this issue, but that doesn’t diminish in any way how we’re going to fight every step of the way against Trump. And I believe that we’re going to have some real successes.</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-3"></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Lulu Garcia-Navarro is a writer and co-host of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-interview">The Interview</a>, a series focused on interviewing the world’s most fascinating people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lulu-garcia-navarro">More about Lulu Garcia-Navarro</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/charles-e-schumer">Charles Schumer</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/democratic-party">Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/hakeem-jeffries">Hakeem Jeffries</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Speech at the Justice Department:</strong> President Trump repeated a number of well-trodden falsehoods in a grievance-fueled speech at the Justice Department. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/fact-check-trump-justice-immigration-crime-eggs.html">Here’s a fact-check</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attacks on Law Firms:</strong> Trump opened a third attack against a private law firm, restricting its business activities just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-law-firm.html">days after a federal judge ruled such measures appeared to violate the Constitution</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aid Cuts Threaten Refugees’ Survival:</strong> The Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/asia/trump-aid-cuts-refugees-rohingya.html">freeze on aid has overwhelmed humanitarian response</a> at a time when multiple conflicts rage, with aid agencies working feverishly to fill the void left by the U.S. government.</p></li><li><p><strong>Arlington National Cemetery:</strong> Materials on the cemetery&#39;s website <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/arlington-cemetery-website-dei.html">highlighting the graves of Black and female service members have vanished</a> as the Trump administration purges government websites of references to diversity and inclusion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pentagon Office Focused on Future Wars:</strong> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the shuttering of the Office of Net Assessment, a small, often secretive and sometimes opaque office that for more than 50 years has helped the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/pete-hegseth-closes-pentagon-office.html">Pentagon’s most senior leaders think about the future of war</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leak Investigations: </strong>The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-administration-leak-investigations.html">opened its first known investigations into what it called “politically motivated leaks</a>,” fulfilling promises to pursue the sources of stories involving national security revelations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Ban:</strong> The Trump administration is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html">considering targeting the citizens of as many as 43 countries</a> as part of a new ban on travel to the United States that would be broader than the restrictions imposed during Trump’s first term, according to officials familiar with the matter.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
