The justices said the appeals court should also examine what kind of notice the government be required to provide that would allow migrants the opportunity to challenge their deportations.</p><div><p>The court said its order would remain in place until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled and the Supreme Court considered any appeal from that ruling.</p><p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote a dissent. He was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.</p><p>The Trump administration has attempted to use the law as a tool in its signature initiative to speed the deportation of millions of migrants, leading to a clash with a skeptical judiciary.</p><p>The Supreme Court has already weighed in on the issue once, agreeing in early April to temporarily allow the administration to proceed with its use of the law, provided it gave migrants subject to it the opportunity to challenge their deportations in court.</p><p>As those challenges have been filed, several lower court judges have concluded that the administration has exceeded the scope of the law, which can be invoked only when the United States has been subject to “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” and have blocked the deportation of groups of Venezuelans.</p><p>Friday’s order came after a high-stakes legal fight between the Trump administration and lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union in one of those challenges. The lawyers rushed to the court on April 18 after getting word that Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas and accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, had received notices of imminent removal and were being loaded on buses, presumably to be taken to the airport.</p><p>The group quickly filed a lawsuit in a federal trial court in Abilene, Texas, on behalf of two of the Venezuelans held at the detention center. Justice Department lawyers responded, telling a trial court judge that they had no immediate plans to deport the detainees.</p><p>The judge, James W. Hendrix, who was appointed during the first Trump administration, declined to issue an order temporarily blocking the deportations.</p><p>The A.C.L.U. subsequently asked the Supreme Court to act instead.</p><p>After midnight on April 19, the justices, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-deportations-venezuelans-el-salvador.html" title="">temporarily paused the deportations, writing</a>, “The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court,” the order said.</p><p>The justices moved swiftly that night, and the emergency application has been pending before the court since.</p><p>Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the justices in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1007/356072/20250419170105032_A.A.R.P.%20Opp.%20FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">court filing</a> to allow lower courts to weigh in before intervening further in the case. He did not address the specifics of the A.C.L.U. claims that the deportations had been imminent, with buses being loaded for the airport. Rather, he said the government had provided notice to detainees subject to imminent deportation and that they “have had adequate time to file” claims challenging their removal.</p><p>In a reply to the court, the A.C.L.U. disputed this, arguing that the Trump administration had taken “actions contrary to this court’s specific ruling” that the government provide notice and time to challenge deportations.</p><p>Instead of providing notice to allow detainees to challenge their removal, the A.C.L.U. brief said, “the government gave detainees an English-only form, not provided to any attorney, which nowhere mentions the right to contest the designation or removal, much less explain how detainees could do so.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="30" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RmZTE4NmVjLTQwMGUtNTE4ZC04YTI1LWQ5OTYyNjg4OWVjNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#trump-scotus-federal-layoffs" data-source-id="100000010174584"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/abbie-vansickle"><img alt="Abbie VanSickle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/11/reader-center/author-abbie-vansickle/author-abbie-vansickle-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/11/reader-center/author-abbie-vansickle/author-abbie-vansickle-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/11/reader-center/author-abbie-vansickle/author-abbie-vansickle-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T20:35:23.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 4:35 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>D.

Her order barred two dozen federal agencies from moving ahead with the largest phase of President Trump’s efforts to downsize the government.</p><div><p>In the emergency application filed on Friday, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, argued that the lower court&#39;s “far-reaching order” would prevent “almost the entire executive branch from formulating and implementing plans to reduce the size of the federal work force.”</p><p>That decision was “based on the extraordinary view” that the president lacked the authority to direct executive agencies on how to conduct large-scale downsizing plans, Mr. Sauer said.</p><p>Judge Illston’s ruling would prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development from carrying out layoffs it had planned for Sunday.</p><p>The request to the justices was the 15th emergency application that the administration filed to the Supreme Court since Mr. Trump returned to office in January. The applications have included asking the justices to lift a nationwide pause on Mr. Trump’s order ending birthright citizenship, to freeze more than $1 billion in foreign aid and to permit the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador without due process.</p><p>In February, Mr. Trump signed <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/14/2025-02762/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> directing officials to draft plans for “large-scale” cuts to the federal work force. Several labor unions, advocacy groups and local governments sued, seeking to block the order.</p><p>Judge Illston held an emergency hearing in the case last Friday and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/federal-layoffs-trump-ruling.html" title="">issued her ruling</a> just hours later.</p><p>In the 42-page ruling, Judge Illston determined that the government’s attempt to lay off workers and shut down offices and programs created an urgent threat to scores of critical services. She also noted that the process <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/903" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required consultation</a> with Congress on any plan to abolish or transfer part of a federal agency.</p><p>On Monday, the Trump administration filed an emergency request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking it to pause Judge Illston’s order pending appeal. But the administration told the Supreme Court that such a ruling would not come quickly enough.</p><p>Of the many lawsuits filed in response to Mr. Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government, the mass layoffs case is poised to have the broadest effect. Many agencies have not yet announced downsizing plans, but employees throughout the government have been anxiously awaiting announcements.</p><p>Eileen Sullivan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="27" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U0ZDJmNDY3LWE0OTktNWJlMS05OTAzLTgyNjViMWU4NjIwYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#james-comey-trump-86-meaning" data-source-id="100000010174023"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/karoun-demirjian"><img alt="Karoun Demirjian" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/07/reader-center/author-Karoun-Demirjian/author-Karoun-Demirjian-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pete-wells"><img alt="Pete Wells" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T20:17:59.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 4:17 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James B. Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, has a long and contentious history with President Trump, who fired him in 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Monica Jorge for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In promising to investigate James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, Trump administration officials pointed to his apparent reference to a slang term on Instagram, describing it as a call for the president’s assassination.</p><p>Mr. Comey’s photo showed shells on a beach arranged to spell “86 47” with the caption: “Cool shell formation on my beach walk.” The “47” was presumed to refer to President Trump, the United States’ 47th president, and “86” is a term commonly used by restaurants to signify when they are out of a menu item, or by bars and in military and intelligence circles to throw something — or someone — out.</p><div><p>But in some contexts, the term has evolved to mean something more sinister: to eliminate or kill.</p><p>According to lexicologists, the term “86” began as diner shorthand in the early 20th century.</p><p>“In the ’30s and ’40s, there were numerical codes used in diners,” said Jesse Sheidlower, an adjunct professor at Columbia University whose specialty is slang. “Eighty-one is a glass of water, 82 is two glasses of water, 89 is a pretty girl, and 86 means you’re out of something.”</p><p>Even today, it is not unusual to see the number 86 on a menu chalkboards in the dining room and white boards in kitchens.</p><p>Slang definitions tend to slide around, though, and terms can mean different things depending on who is using them.</p><p>The most common modern usage of “86” is as a verb, meaning to throw out, dismiss or eject. Customers who are tossed out of an establishment for being too drunk, having a history of walking out on the check or generally acting obnoxious, for example, are said to be 86’d.</p><p>And like many slang terms having to do with disappearance, “86” has evolved in some contexts to refer to deliberate elimination. This is the sense the noir crime writer James Ellroy meant when he wrote, in his 2021 novel “Widespread Panic,” “it all got tangled up, and poor Janey got 86’d’.”</p><p>“Yes, it can mean ‘to murder,’” Mr. Sheidlower added. “But without any very specific indication that that’s the intended meaning, you’d never assume that. The notion that Comey was suggesting this is completely preposterous.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Trump and his top advisers interpreted Mr. Comey’s post in that light, even though he subsequently asserted that he “didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence” and took down the initial photo.</p><p>The pair have a tangled history, dating to Mr. Comey’s decision in 2017 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/us/politics/fbi-investigation-trump-russia-comey.html" title="">to announce that the F.B.I. was investigating the 2016 Trump campaign</a> and whether it had colluded with Russia to influence the election. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html" title="">fired him months later</a>.</p><p>An inspector general’s report later found Mr. Comey had violated department policies with how he handled memos he took of his conversations with Mr. Trump before his firing, but he was never charged. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/trump-treason-impeachment.html" title="">also accused</a> Mr. Comey of treason.</p><p>When Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/politics/comey-mueller.html" title="">learned in 2019</a> that the Justice Department would not file charges against Mr. Comey, he called one aide after another, asking if they agreed with him that Mr. Comey should have been prosecuted. Mr. Trump became so enraged over that decision, as well as other matters, that he took the TV remote control in his private dining room and threw it at a credenza along a wall, according to reporting in the book “Confidence Man.”</p><p>In a Fox News interview on Friday, Mr. Trump still appeared to harbor ill will toward Mr. Comey. Criticizing him as a “dirty cop,” the president accused Mr. Comey of having called for his offing.</p><p>“He wasn’t very competent but he was competent enough to know what that meant,” Mr. Trump said in an excerpt of a Fox News interview that was to be broadcast on Friday night. He added: “He’s calling for the assassination of the president.”</p><p>In his second Instagram post, Mr. Comey said he had assumed the shells spelled out “a political message.” But Mr. Trump’s officials doubled down. Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, pointed out during a Fox News interview late Thursday that Mr. Comey had spent his entire career prosecuting the kind of mobsters and gangsters who would commonly use “86” in its most deadly sense, as she accused him of “issuing a hit on President Trump.”</p><p>Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1923141313005785365" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that Mr. Comey had “just called for the assassination” of the president, and said that her department and the Secret Service had launched an investigation. In <a href="https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1923151715777356062" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a separate post</a>, Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, said his agency would “provide all necessary support.”</p><p><a href="https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/eaw7fwy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Green’s Dictionary of Slang”</a> cites the first definition of “86” as the restaurant usage, and gives “to kill, murder; to execute judicially” as the second meaning.</p><p>“It broadly means unavailability and thus ending,” Mr. Sheidlower said, noting that murderous connotations can attach to almost any slang term having to do with disappearance. “‘End’ itself can be used to mean ‘to kill.’ ”</p><p>Slippery meanings are an inherent danger of slang, which can mean different things depending on who’s using it.</p><p>“There can be ambiguity because what other people think and what you think don’t have to match,” Mr. Sheidlower said. “That’s the problem with language.”</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="26" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzAzZjBiZTVkLTFmMWItNWJiOC05ZGY5LWVmMGVjNmViZTYyZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#trump-democrats-weapons-sales" data-source-id="100000010174513"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robert-jimison"><img alt="Robert Jimison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T19:43:00.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 3:43 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Christopher S.

The packages include Chinook helicopters, armed drones, hundreds of bombs, targeting kits, F-16 aircraft components and other military equipment.</p><div><p>The State Department approved the proposed sales and formally notified Congress shortly before Mr. Trump’s trip. However, for the sale to the Emirates, the administration bypassed an informal review period that allows senior lawmakers on foreign affairs committees to raise concerns or negotiate changes before full congressional notification.</p><p>Leading the opposition is Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who on Thursday introduced resolutions aimed at blocking the arms sales to both countries.</p><p>Mr. Murphy questioned the sale to Qatar in light of reports that the country had offered Mr. Trump a $400 million luxury Boeing jet as a gift.</p><p>“Unless Qatar rescinds their offer of a ‘palace in the sky’ or Trump turns it down, I will move to block this arms sale,” Mr. Murphy said in a statement. He also pointed to a $5.5 billion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/trump-family-qatar-dubai.html" title="">real estate and golf course deal</a> involving the Trump family and a firm affiliated with Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. The project would involve a Trump-branded beachside golf course and luxury villa development in the country.</p><p>Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, all Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, joined in supporting the resolutions, along with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.</p><p>The group also expressed concerns about the Emirates sale, saying it was improperly connected to recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-usd1-dubai-conference-announcement.html" title="">investment by a state-backed Emirati firm</a> into a cryptocurrency business linked to the Trump family.</p><p>Additionally, the lawmakers criticized the Emirates for its role in the war Sudan. U.S. and U.N. officials have accused the Emirates of supporting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/africa/sudan-rsf-zamzam.html" title="">Rapid Support Forces</a>, a Sudanese paramilitary group that the State Department, during the Biden administration, determined committed genocide in Sudan.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s State Department has not made the same determination, though officials have repeatedly condemned the group, including last month after an attack led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/africa/sudan-rsf-zamzam.html" title="">deaths of 300 people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee</a>.</p><p>“The U.S. should not be delivering weapons to the U.A.E. as it aids and abets this humanitarian disaster and gross human rights violations,” Mr. Van Hollen said in the statement. “We must stop this corrupt Trump family crypto-for-arms deal and use our leverage to prevent more suffering in Sudan — and bring its civil war to a peaceful resolution.”</p><p>A parallel effort is underway in the House.

A spokesman for Mr. Musk’s group did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The confrontation between the two watchdog groups was first <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gao-audit-elon-musk-doge-government-agencies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> by Wired.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s group has audited agencies across government, and claims to have found $170 billion in savings, although that figure is inflated by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/upshot/doge-musk-trump-errors.html" title="">errors</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html" title="">guesswork</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-agencies.html" title="">zombie contracts</a> that were killed but later reinstated.</p><p>On the surface, the Government Accountability Office would seem less like a target and more like an ally of Mr. Musk’s group. The office audits federal programs for waste, fraud and mismanagement. Its budget is about <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-900570.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$900 million,</a> but the agency <a href="https://www.facebook.com/usgao/posts/did-you-know-that-for-every-1-invested-in-gao-in-fiscal-year-2024-we-saved-congr/987692976730909/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> it saves $76 for every dollar invested in its work.</p><p>But now the accountability office could become a roadblock for President Trump, who set Mr. Musk’s group in motion.</p><p>The older watchdog agency, led by Comptroller General Gene L. Dodaro, finds itself at the center of a brewing battle over a power known as impoundment, the ability of the president to halt the delivery of funds that have been appropriated by Congress.</p><p>In his sweeping reconfiguration of American government, Mr. Trump has claimed he has vast powers to direct the course of the nation’s spending. He and his leading budget adviser, Russell T. Vought, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/congress-trump-spending.html" title="">maintain that a 1970s law</a> restricting impoundment is unconstitutional, setting up a potential legal clash around the power over the nation’s purse.</p><p>Still, the statute empowers the Government Accountability Office to investigate potential violations, and in late April, Mr. Dodaro acknowledged his team had opened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-funds-gao.html" title="">more than three dozen probes</a> into reports that the Trump administration illegally withheld congressionally authorized funds.</p><p>“We’re trying to get information from the agencies about what their legal position is for not expending the money,” Mr. Dodaro told the Senate at a hearing, as he acknowledged some agencies had been “unresponsive” to the inquiries.</p><p>Mr. Dodaro did not signal how his office might proceed, but it has the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/what-impoundment-control-act-and-what-gaos-role" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">power under law</a> to sue the administration for violations.</p><p>A similar showdown arose at the end of Mr. Trump’s first term, as Democrats moved to impeach him. The Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/us/politics/gao-trump-ukraine.html" title="">found that the administration had violated</a> the law by illegally withholding roughly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in defiance of Congress, though the administration claimed it had acted lawfully.</p><p>Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Musk’s group has no power over the older watchdog group.</p><p>“The law is crystal clear: G.A.O. is a legislative branch agency not subject to DOGE or the president’s whims,” Ms. Murray said in a statement. “It is an indispensable, impartial government watchdog, and its independence must remain. My message to Elon and DOGE: get lost.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has already faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/library-of-congress-trump.html" title="">pushback</a> from legislators of both parties over his effort to take over another congressional institution: the Library of Congress. Mr. Trump recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/library-of-congress-trump.html" title="">fired the librarian of Congress</a> before the end of her term, and sought to replace her with his former personal lawyer, now a top official at the Department of Justice.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMzc5MTQ3MzgtNDFlMy01YjljLTk2OGMtODkzMmY3N2NhMzM3"><div id="37914738-41e3-5b9c-968c-8932f77ca337" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#37914738-41e3-5b9c-968c-8932f77ca337"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aishvarya-kavi"><img alt="Aishvarya Kavi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/11/us/politics/author-aishvarya-kavi/author-aishvarya-kavi-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/11/us/politics/author-aishvarya-kavi/author-aishvarya-kavi-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/11/us/politics/author-aishvarya-kavi/author-aishvarya-kavi-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T19:14:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 3:14 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>At a hearing on Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s case, the judge and lawyers for the Trump administration clashed over the legality of his deportation.

Powell, the chair of the central bank, announced the plan on Friday in an internal note to staff members reviewed by The New York Times. Certain employees will be eligible to participate in a voluntary deferred resignation program that is aimed at giving those close to retirement the option of an earlier exit. That offer will only apply to people at the Washington-based Board of Governors.</p><div><p>Cuts are expected to be made across the entire Federal Reserve System, including the 12 regional banks. Roughly 2,400 people will be affected.</p><p>“I have directed the leadership of the Federal Reserve, here at the Board and across the System, to find incremental ways to consolidate functions where appropriate, modernize some business practices, and ensure that we are right-sized and able to meet our statutory mission,” Mr. Powell said in the memo.</p><p>The Fed earlier this year imposed a hiring freeze on permanent workers as part of its efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/business/federal-reserve-trump-executive-orders.html" title="">align with the Trump administration’s decree</a> that no federal position vacant at the time could be filled nor could new positions be created. It also took steps to distance itself from diversity issues as well as those related to climate change — initiatives that President Trump has opposed.</p><p>The Fed is a politically independent institution, meaning it is not legally obligated to carry out orders by the executive branch. That buffer from the White House is being legally challenged by the Department of Justice, which has sought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-agency-leaders-firings.html" title="">more sway</a> over independent agencies.</p><p>The announcement made on Friday mirrors an effort by the Fed during the Clinton administration to cull its work force, which Mr. Powell cited in his note. At that time, there were “government-wide efforts to improve efficiency,” as was the case “now,” Mr. Powell said.</p><p>Yet at a congressional hearing in February, Mr. Powell pushed back on the idea that the Fed had too many employees. “Overworked, maybe, not overstaffed.”</p><p>Mr. Trump is pursuing a similar goal, although much more aggressively than past administrations have. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, led by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has taken to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-doge-federal-job-cuts.html" title="">gutting</a> the federal work force, including shuttering agencies wholesale. Tens of thousands of government employees have since left their jobs.</p><p>The Fed’s decision is not tied to the ongoing initiative by DOGE, although some staff at the central bank were contacted earlier this year via email by Mr. Musk’s group, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>“The Federal Reserve is a careful and responsible steward of public resources,” Mr. Powell said in his note on Friday.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjE5NGFjMjEtNjRjNy01Yjc4LWIxY2QtNDA0MjIyMzhhODI3"><div id="6194ac21-64c7-5b78-b1cd-40422238a827" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#6194ac21-64c7-5b78-b1cd-40422238a827"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson"><img alt="Catie Edmondson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbStandard-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T18:17:49.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 2:17 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Republicans on the House Budget Committee just announced the panel will reconvene on Sunday night at 10 p.m. to reconsider their party’s megabill that conservatives on the panel blocked today.

McElroy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. In that earlier ruling, she found that the government could not abruptly wipe out a pandemic-era funding stream that many state and local health departments relied upon. </p><div><p>In the opinion Judge McElroy issued on Friday, she wrote: “The health care funding terminations would constrain the States’ infectious disease research, thwart treatment efforts to those struggling with mental health and addiction, and impact the availability of vaccines to children, the elderly, and those living in rural communities. Not to mention that the terminations were effective immediately, ignoring the States’ reliance on the funds.” </p><p>The Department announced the cutoffs on March 24. A coalition of 23 states and the District of Columbia then sued to stop the sudden change, arguing that they had been given no time to prepare for budget shortfalls and could face devastating shortages in many critical treatment areas.</p><p>Judge McElroy on Friday directed federal health agencies to “take every step necessary to effectuate this order” while the case proceeds — namely, disbursing the funds, which had already been allocated by Congress for the purposes of the state programs. Notably, however, her order only applies to those jurisdictions involved in the lawsuit.</p><p>Judge McElroy’s rulings mean that funding will remain in place for that coalition of Democratic-led states, which together represent more than 185 million Americans, or a little over half of the United States population counted in the last census. </p><p>In defending the cuts, the Trump administration has argued that since the official end of the emergency over the coronavirus pandemic in 2023, the funding was no longer necessary. </p><p>The states behind the lawsuit countered that the funding was intended to address a variety of public health problems — some of them worsened by the onslaught of Covid-19 — and that, much like other federal funding streams the Trump administration has worked to cut off, the money was authorized by Congress and could not be lawfully cut off unilaterally by the health department.</p><p>Judge McElroy’s ruling noted that the funds helped address disease outbreaks beyond the coronavirus, including measles and avian flu; bolstered mental health and substance abuse services; and helped support clinics in underserved areas.<span>  </span></p><p>“Though Congress appropriated the funds during the pandemic,” she wrote, the funds “did much more than address Covid-related public health concerns.” </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzExOTU3MGFhLWU1NTktNTEwZC1iZTkwLTkwNjU5ZTJlMDZhNQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#homeland-security-immigration-reality-show" data-source-id="100000010173839"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz"><img alt="Hamed Aleaziz" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T16:36:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 12:36 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rob Worsoff, a television producer, left, with Jack Osbourne in 2013.

She said the department was still reviewing the idea, which was pitched by a producer named Rob Worsoff.</p><div><p>“The pitch generally was a celebration of being an American and what a privilege it is to be able to be a citizen of the United States of America,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “It’s important to revive civic duty.”</p><p>She said the agency was happy to review “out-of-the-box pitches,” particularly those that celebrate “what it means to be an American.”</p><p>The project was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14713113/DHS-Secretary-Kristi-Noem-reality-TV-immigrants-compete-US-citizenship.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier by The Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>Mr. Worsoff, a 49-year-old Canadian American, said he first thought of the idea during his own naturalization process. He said that immigrants in the show would compete in challenges in various states. He said one challenge could be highlighting NASA in Texas or Florida and seeing which immigrant could assemble and launch a rocket first. There would also be trivia or civic challenges.</p><p>The show would end with someone being sworn in as a U.S. citizen, Mr. Worsoff said.</p><p>“We need a national conversation of what it means to be American,” he said. “We need to be reminded of how proud and how much of an honor it is to be American.”</p><p>Mr. Worsoff said no one would be penalized in their immigration process or deported as a result.</p><p>“I think it’s nonsense because what’s going to happen is we’re going to get to know these people and their stories and their journeys, and we’re celebrating them as humans,” he said. “We’re putting a face to these people, to their journey.”</p><p>Mr. Worsoff said the actual details of what would happen in the show would depend on what TV networks wanted and what the Department of Homeland Security could do. He said he had pitched the idea to the agency before, including in 2012.</p><p>Under Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, the agency has often focused on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/arts/television/trump-administration-deportation-videos.html" title="">publicity and reality-TV tactics</a> to showcase President Trump’s hard-line immigration policies.</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin said the TV pitch had not yet reached the level of Ms. Noem. She said on social media that the department “receives hundreds of television show pitches a year,” including for documentaries about border operations and white-collar investigations.</p><p>“Each proposal undergoes a thorough vetting process prior to denial or approval,” Ms. McLaughlin added.</p><p>The department has worked with filmmakers on programming in the past.</p><p>In 2017, during the first Trump administration, the agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/trump-immigration-nation-netflix.html" title="">allowed documentary filmmakers</a> extensive access to operations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for a program called “Immigration Nation.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDM2MGM0OTMtZGZkOC01MjA4LWJlOWQtYTdiMjE0ODA2OTNi"><div id="0360c493-dfd8-5208-be9d-a7b21480693b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/16/us/trump-news#0360c493-dfd8-5208-be9d-a7b21480693b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/catie-edmondson"><img alt="Catie Edmondson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbStandard-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/us/politics/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog/catie-edmonson-twitter-chatblog-thumbLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-05-16T16:08:21.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">May 16, 2025, 12:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Now that five conservative Republicans on the House Budget Committee have tanked their party’s push to get their tax and spending cuts legislation to the House floor, Republican leaders will have to scramble to find changes that can both placate the hardliners and the more centrist members of the conference.

Without the support of Republican hard-liners on the Budget Committee, the bill cannot advance. But any changes to win their backing could alienate the more moderate Republicans whose votes will also be needed to pass the measure on the House floor.</p><p>Five Republicans representatives — Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania — joined Democrats in voting to block the legislation. The vote was 16 to 21 on a motion to advance the bill.</p><p>“This bill falls profoundly short; it does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits,” Mr. Roy said ahead of the vote, explaining his opposition. “Deficits will go up in the first half of the 10-year budget window, and we all know it’s true, and we shouldn’t do that. We shouldn’t say that we’re doing something we’re not doing.”</p><p>A few hours after the vote failed, committee leaders announced that the panel would reconvene Sunday at 10 p.m. to reconsider the legislation. It was not clear what, if any, changes Republican leaders agreed to before calling lawmakers back.</p><p>But immediately after the vote, they had not seemed optimistic: The committee’s chairman, Representative Jodey C. Arrington of Texas, told its members they could return home to their districts.</p><p>“Well, the noes have it,” Mr. Arrington said. “I want to thank everybody for their time and patience, and godspeed and safe travels.”</p><p>Mr. Smucker, who changed his “yes” vote to a “no” vote at the last minute, said he did so for procedural reasons. Because he voted against the bill, he will be able to ask to call the legislation back up for consideration once Republicans broker a deal.</p><p>The legislation the party is trying to push through would make Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay through 2028, fulfilling a campaign pledge. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidies for clean energy would partly offset the roughly $3.8 trillion cost of those tax measures over 10 years, as well as increased spending on the military and immigration enforcement.</p><p>But the conservatives are demanding changes to the bill, arguing that their leaders did not go far enough to cut federal spending. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that calls for lower deficits, estimated that the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. A number of House conservatives have said they do not want to vote for legislation unless it is deficit neutral.</p><p>The changes the conservatives seek cut to the heart of concerns from their most centrist colleagues. Chief among the hard-liners’ frustrations is that a measure imposing work requirements on childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities would not kick in until 2029.</p><p>“We’re telling a healthy body, a healthy American, that you’ve got four years to get a job,” Mr. Norman said.</p><p>They are also unhappy that the legislation does not immediately eliminate a slew of clean energy tax credits that were created by President Joseph R.

Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, have described the tax bill as helping everyday Americans, economists have found that its most generous and lasting benefits will go to the wealthy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As Representative Jason Smith commenced a marathon session this week to consider a sprawling and expensive Republican tax package, he took special care to emphasize his party’s commitment to “hard-working Americans.”</p><p>“Pro-growth tax policy will shift our economy toward one that serves them, not the wealthy and well-connected,” Mr. Smith, the Missouri lawmaker who leads the House’s top tax panel, proclaimed.</p><div><p>But the proposal he is trying to get to President Trump’s desk ultimately tells a more complicated story. The Republican tax plan may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, according to a wide range of tax experts, and some taxpayers may actually be left in worse financial shape if the bill becomes law.</p><p>The latest assessment arrived Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan scorekeeper closely watched on Capitol Hill. Economists found that many Americans who make less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026.</p><p>The Penn Wharton estimate sought to analyze the full scope of the Republican tax package, computing the effects of the tax cuts as well as the plan to pay for them by slashing federal spending on other programs, including Medicaid and food stamps. Combined, those policies could fall disproportionately on the poorest, including those near or below the poverty line, the economists found.</p><p>People making between about $51,000 and $17,000 could lose about $700 on average in after-tax income beginning in 2026, according to the analysis, when factoring in both wages and federal aid. That reduction would worsen over the next eight years. People reporting less than $17,000 in income would see a reduction closer to $1,000, on average, also increasing over time, a shortfall that underscores their reliance on federal benefits.</p><p>By contrast, the top 0.1 percent, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, the data show. These earners benefit more from a Republican measure because it cuts taxes on the wealthy and makes other favorable changes, including for businesses, which may improve the value of their investments.</p><p>Penn Wharton did not factor economic growth into its projections. In recent days, Republicans have vigorously rejected any assertion that their bill is better for the richest Americans, arguing that it would generate substantial economic returns and deliver new jobs and rising wages in the process.</p><p>The legislation would extend a set of tax cuts on individuals and businesses that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies passed in 2017. That extension would stave off the “largest tax hike in American history,” Mr. Smith, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said at a hearing Tuesday. His office declined to comment.</p><p>The discrepancy highlights both the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the sheer scope of the changes that House Republicans seek. Much of their tax agenda remains a work in progress, as party leaders continue to grapple with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/republicans-domestic-policy-bill.html" title="">simmering divisions in their ranks</a> and growing demands for changes from their counterparts in the Senate.</p><p>The extent of those fissures became clear on Friday, after a g<a href="#house-republicans-policy-bil" title="">roup of conservative Republicans voted</a> to block their party’s tax package from heading to the House floor. They demanded additional spending cuts, sending the party’s leaders scrambling, even though Mr. Trump had called on lawmakers hours earlier to unite around the bill.</p><p>“We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party,” the president wrote on social media. “STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”</p><p>At the core of the effort, Republicans are racing to preserve the policies they enacted for Mr. Trump in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. The sprawling law changed the way taxpayers calculate their annual bills while lowering the corporate rate to 21 percent and the tax rate on the highest-earning individuals to 37 percent.</p><p>Republicans consider the law a resounding success. In a report issued in April, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the 2017 tax cuts increased the nation’s total economic output, which was 2.5 percent higher at the end of 2019 compared with the period before the law was enacted, while growing real wages by nearly $5,000.</p><p>“It helped set us up for a better economic situation going into the pandemic,” said Matthew D. Dickerson, the director of budget policy at the conservative-leaning Economic Policy Innovation Center.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump’s agenda may offer only modest gains to workers, some of whom may actually be left in worse financial shape if the House Republicans’ bill were to become law.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L. Cross for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>But economists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/business/economy/trump-tax-cuts-effects.html" title="">long have warred over the law’s impact</a>, including its effects on the federal debt and its consequences for workers. Reviewing its economic and fiscal effects last year, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, found that an extension would again cut taxes for most Americans, but nearly <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/feature/reassessing-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half of its benefits</a> would flow to those who make <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/those-making-450000-and-would-get-nearly-half-benefit-extending-tcja" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$450,000 a year or more.</a></p><p>“Delivering tax relief that way, it’s sort of unavoidable to not have most of the benefits go to higher-income people,” said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.</p><p>In reprising that approach, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies unveiled a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/house-gop-tax-bill-trump.html" title="">bevy of additions</a> they have described as a boon for everyday workers. For individual taxpayers, they proposed to raise the standard deduction by $1,000, while aiming to lift it by $4,000 for seniors, in a move meant to replace the president’s promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security.</p><p>House Republican lawmakers also proposed adding $500 to the child tax credit, which families can receive through their tax filings annually, and they looked to end federal taxes on tips and overtime pay, as requested by Mr. Trump.</p><p>Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said in an interview this week on CNBC that the president had instructed Congress to “go after the things that are going to help middle-class folks.”</p><p>The sum of those proposals could help reduce many workers’ tax bills, according to early analyses. One report this week from the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/big-beautiful-bill-house-gop-tax-plan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tax Foundation</a>, a research center that generally favors lower taxes, found that the legislation would increase market incomes — a measure of income that includes wages and other elements — by 4.4 percent on average in 2026.</p><p>But Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the organization, said the benefits would not be parceled out equally, resulting in the “larger increases in after-tax income for the top 5 percent of taxpayers.”</p><p>Asked about the early findings, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that the president’s “‘one big, beautiful bill’ will continue to prove the haters wrong.”</p><p>Mr. Fields also pointed to the <a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications/2025/jcx-23-25/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">findings of the Joint Committee on Taxation</a>, a nonpartisan budget keeper on Capitol Hill. Its report, issued Tuesday, showed most Americans would see a tax cut under the House measure, though some lower-income taxpayers could see increases. That may be because some of Republicans’ proposed tax cuts targeting workers are temporary and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-temporary.html" title="">would expire within the next 10 years</a>.</p><p>But the tax scorekeepers only captured some of the effects of Republicans’ agenda. In the House, party leaders have moved to offset their proposal with an expansive set of cuts to a wide variety of federal agencies, programs and tax credits, some of which serve those with lower incomes.</p><p>House Republicans chose, for example, to tighten eligibility for tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase health insurance. Party leaders also proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/republicans-medicaid-cuts.html" title="">deep reductions in Medicaid</a>, which offers coverage to the poor, and food stamps.</p><p>Under each of those changes, millions of Americans stand to lose access to federal safety net benefits, according to the government’s own estimates in recent months. Those losses threaten to overshadow any gains among some of those families from the president’s campaign to slash taxes, some data show.</p><p>“It is dishonest to pretend the tax analysis is a full representation of the bill,” said Brendan Duke, the senior director for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group.</p><p>In his own <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/how-house-republican-agenda-boosts-the-wealthy-does-little-or-worse-for-low-income-families" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">number crunching</a>, Mr. Duke found that the after-tax income of people making over $1 million would rise by 4.3 percent in 2027, translating to an average gain of more than $89,000. His analysis incorporated a Republican plan to relax the estate tax, which benefits higher earners.</p><p>But Mr. Duke found that the bottom fifth of all American earners would see only a 0.6 improvement in their after-tax income, which on average equals about $90. His analysis did not include the effects of spending cuts in programs like Medicaid.</p><p>The savings nonetheless help to offset a package that introduces a series of permanent tax changes that carry great benefits for the wealthy.</p><p>House Republicans have proposed a higher threshold for triggering the estate tax, which eases the financial burden on wealthier Americans who pass down large inheritances, along with a 23 percent deduction for so-called pass-through income, which reduces taxes on business income taxed at the individual rates of an owner.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-new-tax-bracket.html" title="">did call for raising taxes on the wealthy</a>, particularly by creating a new tax bracket for people making more than $2.5 million a year. But the president later backed away from that push as he faced an onslaught of criticism from members of his own party. Even Mr. Trump later admitted the idea would be “very disruptive.”</p><p>“The Bill is GREAT,” the president <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114495946485549840" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on Truth Social this week, as House Republicans began to advance key portions of his tax agenda, adding: “The Golden Age of America will soon be upon us.”</p><p>Andrew Duehren<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
