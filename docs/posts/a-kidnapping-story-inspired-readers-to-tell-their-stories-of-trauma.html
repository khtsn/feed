I considered heading back to bed, but I noticed that my email inbox was filling. Really, really filling. Within an hour I had a hundred new messages; by noon, hundreds more. Any journalist will tell you that this is a terrifying prospect, that it usually means you’re in some sort of trouble. I began to open them with one hand over my eyes.</p><p>The story was originally just about Teich — a family friend of mine who was kidnapped at gunpoint 50 years ago, in 1974 — but as the article began its discussion of trauma, I chose to elucidate what I was seeing in him by sharing a traumatic experience of my own: the 2007 birth of my older son. I used my story to illustrate the overlap in trauma as a condition, that it didn’t matter so much the circumstances as the state a person is left in when something goes wrong. Some of the emails were from people who knew the Teiches and law enforcement who worked on the case, but most of them were about the intertwining of the stories. Most of them praised it; two different ones told me I had embarrassed myself and ruined my son’s life both in telling the story and being traumatized by what turned out to be a healthy birth. (I hold special affection for those two!)</p><p>But almost all of the emailers also included another story: their own. Email after email contained a kind of testimony, the simple reiteration of a time when things went wrong for them, like my son’s birth — like Jack’s kidnapping. The stories were about anything from a dental procedure gone wrong to an abusive relationship to a gang rape. There were kidnappings, yes, but also parents’ divorces and car accidents. The notes were short and long. They were brisk and confessional. They were heartfelt and in Comic Sans font.</p><p>There were so many of them that eventually I had to stop reading, unable to do what they were asking me to do, though I wasn’t sure what that was yet. Two weeks before, I went away for a weekend with Dr. Lydia P. Ogden, who happens to be a trauma therapist and a professor of social work at Salem State University in Massachusetts. (We are old friends, but, yes, I travel with a trauma therapist and highly recommend it.) During our trip, we met a doctor who, hearing Lydia’s job title, wondered aloud if “trauma” was now an overused word. As I sat reading those emails, I started wondering if it was actually <em>under</em>used.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And then there were the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/magazine/kidnapping-long-island.html#commentsContainer" title="">comments</a>. From the day the story published, my colleagues at The Times asked me if I had been reading the comments on the story, but I couldn’t bring myself to wade into them. The emails were hard enough — I wasn’t done with them, and I felt they all deserved to be read in a sacred state. But I watched as the number of comments grew; something in me was so exhausted from the course the story took that if they were anything like the emails, I couldn’t bear them.</p><p>Then, on election night, as I awaited the returns, I moused over to my story and decided to finally read the comments. I scrolled through them, and I read all of them, all the testimony. One person who had kept asking me if I’d seen them was Jack’s eldest son, Marc, who had been so moved by them. He told me that the isolation of his childhood, of believing that no one else would understand what happened to his father and how it hung over their family, was its own trauma — the trauma of believing that your suffering is unique. Whereas I recognized my own suffering in Jack’s story — as I say in the piece, all trauma eventually rounds down to looking pretty much the same — Marc was astounded by the number of kidnappings mentioned in the comments section. (Now, kidnapping is a pretty rare crime, but it seems to affect the Times readership disproportionately. If you can read this, stay safe out there!)</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
