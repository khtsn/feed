Mr. Trzaskowski had been supported by the country’s centrist and Brussels-steeped prime minister, Donald Tusk; Mr. Nawrocki by the Trump administration.</p><p>The result, announced Monday, will have little immediate impact on Poland’s domestic or foreign policies, which the president does not control. The country will continue supporting Ukraine militarily, a policy both sides agree on. Nor will the change result in a move to leave the European Union.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal candidate Mr. Nawrocki defeated, among supporters on Sunday evening.

Battles have raged over divisive issues like migration, abortion and L.G.B.T. rights. National sovereignty has also become a rallying cry on the right, against the power of the European Union to mandate changes many see as being in conflict with traditional values and, in Poland’s case, the Roman Catholic Church.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jaroslaw Kuisz, a political analyst affiliated with the universities of Warsaw and Oxford, described it as a battle between “two Wests — two power centers that are ideologically very different.”</p><p>Poland, by choosing a Trump-aligned president who opposes a pro-European sitting government, he added, “has become a microcosm of a global conflict that divides the West in a way unprecedented since 1989.” That was when communism collapsed across Eastern and Central Europe, leaving liberal democracy as the only true path, according to both Washington and Brussels at the time.</p><p>No longer united by faith in a single model, Poland and other countries on the European Union’s eastern flank now find themselves caught between the populist nationalism of Mr. Trump and defenders of the old post-Cold War liberal order.</p><p>The Polish presidential runoff on Sunday came just two weeks after voters in Romania <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/world/europe/nicusor-dan-romania-election.html" title="">rejected a nationalist candidate</a>, George Simion, in a presidential election. Mr. Simion had declared himself a “candidate on the MAGA ticket” and his defeat by a centrist raised the hopes of liberals that Europe’s right-wing populist wave was receding and that the continent might return to a more stable, even keel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>George Simion, who lost a bid to become Romania’s president in May, speaking to supporters in Bucharest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mihai Barbu/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Those hopes evaporated Monday. Exit polling data Sunday night showed a win for Mr. Trzaskowski. But once the ballots were counted, Mr. Nawrocki had 50.9 percent of the vote.</p><p>It was hardly an emphatic triumph for what Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary has proclaimed a “new era of the patriots of Western civilization” led by Mr. Trump. But it showed that nationalism has staying power.</p><p>Victory for Mr. Nawrocki, said Michal Szuldrzynski, the editor in chief of Rzeczpospolita, a centrist newspaper, “heralds a period of great turbulence in Poland, and in the world — the effect of the global wave of Trumpism.”</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Orban, an admirer of Mr. Trump and would-be leader of a European movement made in his image, welcomed Mr. Trzaskowski’s defeat. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>France’s hard-right standard-bearer, Marine Le Pen, celebrated the result as a “rejection of a Brussels oligarchy” intent on imposing its policies “without any democratic will.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marine Le Pen pictured last week, congratulated Mr. Nawrocki on his win.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Delphine Mayeur/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Whether on the left or right, voters interviewed in Warsaw on Election Day said the importance of the vote went beyond just the largely ceremonial presidency. “That is peanuts,” Jan Brykczynski, 62, a psychologist, said of the presidency, after casting his vote for Mr. Trzaskowski. “The stakes are much higher,” he added.</p><p>Krystina Kwiatkowska, 61, a health care worker forced into early retirement last year by government spending cuts, said she did not particularly like Mr. Nawrocki but voted for him because she wanted to make sure that Mr. Tusk did not have a free hand. It was good for Poland to stay anchored in both Western camps, she said.</p><p>Mr. Trzaskowski, she said, had done a good job as the mayor of Warsaw. But, she added, he was not his own man because “above him there is always this red fox,” using an expression the right often deploys to present Mr. Tusk as a conniving enemy of Poland’s national interest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Piotr Buras, the head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Mr. Nawrocki had falsely framed the election as a choice between Washington and Brussels. He had done this “for domestic political purposes” disconnected from the reality of a country that wants good relations with both, Mr. Buras added.</p><p>“Ideologically and politically, Nawrocki represents the other concept of the West, the one defined by Vance in Munich,” he said, referring to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html" title="">February speech</a> in which Vice President JD Vance accused Europe of retreating from shared values with the United States by trying to isolate hard-right parties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voting in Warsaw on Sunday. Poland traditionally has strong relations with the United States.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Petr David Josek/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“A majority of Poles decided to go for a candidate who is close to Trump but that was not their main motivation,” Mr. Buras said. Poland, he added, was “very divided but voters were not consciously choosing any foreign policy orientation.”</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Nawrocki assailed Mr. Tusk for, in his telling, jeopardizing Poland’s traditionally strong relations with the United States, which has around 10,000 soldiers in the country and has long been viewed as the guarantor of Polish security. Last month Mr. Trump received Mr. Nawrocki in the Oval Office, an honor so far denied to the Polish prime minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Emboldened by Mr. Trump’s frequent criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr. Nawrocki has recently given voice to deep currents of anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Poland. Those feelings, rooted in history, have been largely suppressed since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with most Poles agreeing that Ukraine needs to be supported militarily as part of the defense of Europe from Russian aggression.</p><p>But Mr. Nawrocki has said he would not support future Ukrainian membership of either NATO or the European Union, neither of which is really on the table — though Mr. Orban and other European populists have used the distant possibility to bash their liberal opponents.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, in a <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1929446035539001512" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">message written in Polish on X,</a> congratulated Mr. Nawrocki, reminding him that Poland “was and remains the foundation of regional and European security and a strong voice in defense of the freedom and dignity of every nation.”</p><p>The Polish presidency has no significant say in setting foreign, economic or other policy, which is the preserve of Mr. Tusk and his ministers. But it can act as a center of opposition to the government by deploying its veto power over legislation and the bully pulpit provided by its role as head of state.</p><p>The departing president, Andrzej Duda, is also an ally of Law and Justice, and frequently vetoed laws passed by Mr. Tusk’s majority in Parliament or sent them for review by courts stacked with loyalists of the previous government. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The election of Mr. Nawrocki, a pugnacious former boxer, to replace Mr. Duda is likely to harden the logjam. It could also exacerbate tensions within Mr. Tusk’s fractious coalition of liberal, leftist and conservative parties, which have a majority in Parliament but not the three-fifths of the seats needed to override a presidential veto.</p><p>Mr. Nawrocki, said Mr. Kuisz, the political analyst, “is much more combative than Duda and he is going to make life much harder for Tusk and Sikorski,” referring to Poland’s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski.</p><p>Mr. Tusk, a former senior official in Brussels who is widely respected by mainstream European politicians, “suffers from Gorbachev syndrome,” Mr. Kuisz added, referring to the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who cooperated with Washington to end the Cold War. “He is more appreciated abroad than at home.”</p><p>Anatol Magdziarz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
