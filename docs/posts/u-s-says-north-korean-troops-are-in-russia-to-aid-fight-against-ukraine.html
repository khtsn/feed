Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III called the North’s presence a “very, very serious” escalation that would have ramifications in both Europe and Asia.</p><p>“What exactly are they doing?” Mr. Austin told reporters at a military base in Italy after a trip to Ukraine. “Left to be seen.” He gave no details about the number of troops already there or the number expected to arrive.</p><p>Mr. Austin cast President Vladimir V. Putin’s need for North Korean mercenaries as a sign of desperation.</p><p>“This is an indication that he may be in even more trouble than most people realize,” he said. “He went tin-cupping early on to get additional weapons and materials from the D.P.R.K.,” he said, using the abbreviation for Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, “and then from Iran, and now he’s making a move to get more people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But he said intelligence analysts were still trying to discern whether the troops were moving toward Ukraine.</p><p>Ukrainian officials insist they are headed there, and Ukraine’s defense minister was quoted on Wednesday saying he expected to see North Korean troops in Kursk, the Russian territory <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion.html" title="">that Ukraine has occupied</a>, in the coming days.</p><p>Mr. Austin’s statement came as American intelligence officials said they were preparing to release a trove of intelligence, including satellite photographs, that show troop ships moving from North Korea to training areas in Vladivostok on Russia’s east coast and other Russian territory further to the north.</p><p>For two weeks, there have been reports of the movements, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/asia/north-korea-ukraine-russia.html" title="">fueled by the Ukrainian and South Korean governments</a>, that more than 12,000 North Koreans were training to fight alongside Russian soldiers.</p><p>John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman at the White House, said on Wednesday that between early and mid-October, the United States tracked about 3,000 North Korean troops who were transported by ship from the North Korean port city of Wonsan to Vladivostok in Russia. Those troops have since been taken to three separate training sites in the Russian Far East, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Kirby said he had no specific assessment of what kind of training the North Korean troops were receiving nor was it known for certain that they would be deployed to the war in Ukraine or how useful they would be given the language and cultural differences. “But,” he added, “this is certainly a highly concerning possibility.”</p><p>He said the United States had not yet seen any specific quid pro quo for North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “What does Kim Jong-un think he’s getting out of it?” Mr. Kirby asked, suggesting it could be some form of technology transfer or other help with North Korea’s military capability. “That’s what’s so concerning to us.”</p><p>Anton A. Kobyakov, an adviser to Mr. Putin, did not explicitly confirm or deny the reports <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/world/asia/putin-brics-summit-xi-modi.html" title="">during a summit</a> on Wednesday in Kazan, Russia. “The Pentagon is not an accountable organization,” he said in response to a reporter’s question.</p><p>Russia has denied earlier reports on North Korea’s troop presence. But Moscow is straining to maintain its costly offensives in Ukraine without destabilizing Russian society. U.S. officials estimate that Russia is recruiting 25,000 to 30,000 new soldiers a month, just enough to replace the dead and the wounded. Some military analysts believe the Kremlin will have a hard time maintaining that pace without resorting to another round of unpopular mobilization.</p><p>To avoid the political cost of a draft, the Russian government has resorted to increasingly unorthodox recruitment tactics. Many Russian regions have sharply increased sign-up bonuses paid to volunteer soldiers and expanded recruitment from prisons and from poor nations such as Cuba and Nepal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Nonetheless, both Russia and North Korea experts called the arrival of North Korean troops a watershed moment. Desperate not to stir up domestic resentments about the huge casualties Russia has taken — over 600,000 killed or wounded, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/russia-casualties-ukraine-war.html" title="">American officials recently estimated</a> — Mr. Putin is now reaching for mercenary forces, supplied by the same country that has sold him more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/russia-ukraine-north-korea.html" title="">a million artillery rounds</a>, many of them defective.</p><p>For Mr. Kim, the war in Ukraine has been a pathway out of geopolitical isolation. For the first time in decades, the North has assets that a major power is willing to pay for.</p><p>His longer-term plan, experts say, may be to improve the reach of his intercontinental ballistic missiles. He is eager, American intelligence agencies believe, to make it clear that his arsenal of nuclear-tipped weapons is capable of hitting American cities.</p><p>“This is the real ‘no-limits partnership,” said Victor Cha, a North Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was a member of President George W. Bush’s National Security Council. “We are in a whole different era if North Korean soldiers are dying for Putin. It will raise the ask when Kim makes demands, and Putin will give him what he wants.”</p><p>In comments to reporters on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine sought to portray North Korea’s presence as an attempt by Mr. Putin to avoid an unpopular mobilization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I wouldn’t say they have run out of personnel,” the Ukrainian leader said of Russia. “However, the reluctance to mobilize their own people is certainly increasing, and there are formats for mobilizing North Korean troops. This is definitely happening.”</p><p>“This indicates that the consequences of this war are already impacting Russian society,” he added.</p><p>One of the central mysteries American and South Korean intelligence agencies are focused on is what Mr. Kim may be receiving in return for contributing troops, even though officials say the United States has not picked up intelligence suggesting that Russia agreed to pay for the mercenaries, or provide oil or much-needed military technology in return. But there have been reports of increased cooperation on missile technology, and in that arena, Mr. Kim has some very specific needs.</p><p>He has been trying to demonstrate that his intercontinental ballistic missiles have the range to reach the United States — a goal that North Korea has had since it seriously began work on its nuclear weapons program in the early 1980s.</p><p>As Mr. Kim’s missiles have grown more accurate, he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/14/world/asia/north-korea-ballistic-missile.html" title="">conducted flight tests</a> that have flown in high arcs into space and landed in the Pacific. But he has not yet conducted a test across the Pacific, one that could also demonstrate that his warheads could survive the intense heat and vibration of re-entering the atmosphere — a challenge that plagued the American and Soviet missile programs in the 1950s.</p><p>“Kim may believe that going this far for Putin will mean that he can raise the ceiling on what he wants in return, possibly higher-end technology for ICBMs and nuclear subs,” said Mr. Cha. “Both are stated goals of the program.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Putin, American intelligence officials suggest, may also have a reason to cooperate. With the Biden administration gradually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/world/europe/biden-ukraine-strike-russia.html" title="">allowing American-made missiles</a> to be shot into Russian territory by Ukrainian forces, some senior officials believe, Mr. Putin has every incentive to help North Korea show that it could threaten American territory.</p><p>Another mystery is how China is reacting to the North’s new deals with Russia. U.S. intelligence has concluded that Chinese officials now want to assure that Russia wins in its conflict with Ukraine, demonstrating that the West, with all its firepower, cannot prevail far from its shores.</p><p>But North Korea has always been highly dependent on Beijing, and Mr. Kim’s move to take advantage of Russia’s need for ammunition and troops is presumed to be unwelcome in Beijing. China remains the North’s critical supplier of oil, and its major trading partner. And it has sometimes used that leverage to insist that Mr. Kim not create instability or conflict in Asia.</p><p>Now the provision of troops threatens all that. But so far, officials say, they have not picked up evidence that China is expressing its displeasure.</p><p>Peter Baker<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, <!-- -->Kim Barker<!-- --> from Kyiv, Ukraine, and <!-- -->Valerie Hopkins<!-- --> from Kazan, Russia.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt">More about Eric Schmitt</a></span></p></div><div><p>David E.
