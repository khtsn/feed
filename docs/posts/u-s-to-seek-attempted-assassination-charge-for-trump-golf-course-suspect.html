Trump was golfing in Florida last week, prosecutors said in a court hearing on Monday. Among the government’s evidence, they said, was a note the suspect had written suggesting that he had planned the attack.</p><p>Such a charge — which prosecutors said they would seek through a grand jury indictment — would carry a maximum possible penalty of life imprisonment.</p><p>United States Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe, of the Federal District Court in West Palm Beach, Fla., granted the government’s request on Monday to keep the suspect, Ryan W. Routh, in jail without bond. So far, Mr. Routh has been charged with unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon, which carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, and with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.</p><p>Mr. Routh’s defense lawyers had argued that their client was not a flight risk and did not pose a serious threat to the community, but Judge McCabe disagreed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/23/us/routh-detention-memo.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/cbefbff53e4f5ce5/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a statement released by his campaign on Monday, Mr. Trump accused the Justice Department and the F.B.I. of “mishandling and downplaying the second assassination attempt on my life since July.” He called the charges against Mr. Routh “a slap on the wrist” and said, “Let Florida handle the case!”</p><p>Last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, said the state would conduct its own investigation into what happened, characterizing the federal inquiry as insufficiently transparent and perhaps biased against Mr. Trump.</p><p>At the court hearing on Monday, which lasted nearly three hours, Mark D. Dispoto, an assistant United States attorney, argued that Mr. Routh had ensconced himself in “nothing short of a sniper’s nest” to target the former president, while Mr. Routh’s federal public defenders extensively questioned the strength of the government’s evidence.</p><p>Kristy Militello, one of his two lawyers, said that Mr. Routh’s actions were the “unsophisticated and sort of untrained” work of a man whose writings suggested that he intended the assassination attempt to fail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Routh, wearing a dark jail uniform with his blond hair combed back, appeared to closely follow the proceedings, especially when Renee Michelle Sihvola, his other lawyer, cross-examined Christian Hull, an F.B.I. special agent, about the government’s evidence.</p><p>According to prosecutors, Mr. Routh, 58, appeared to have surveyed the grounds of the Trump International Golf Club for about a month before his arrest. On Sept. 15, Mr. Routh positioned himself outside the fence near the sixth hole of the course, where at about 1:30 p.m., a Secret Service agent on a golf cart who was scouting one hole ahead of the former president saw part of Mr. Routh’s face and the barrel of his gun.</p><p>At the time he was spotted, prosecutors said, Mr. Routh was aligned directly with the sixth hole, with the intention of shooting Mr. Trump from a relatively short distance using a semiautomatic rifle. The rifle, equipped with a scope, was found abandoned at the scene; it had a round in the chamber and a total of 11 rounds loaded. Investigators found Mr. Routh’s fingerprint on duct tape affixing the scope to the weapon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,” Mr. Routh wrote in a note that was placed inside a box that he left at a friend’s house in North Carolina, according to prosecutors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,” the note continued. “It is up to you to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.”</p><p>The friend contacted law enforcement officials and told them about the note three days after Mr. Routh’s arrest.</p><p>In the note, prosecutors said, Mr. Routh also wrote that Mr. Trump was unfit to be president. Mr. Routh had left the note at the house several months before the shooting — an indication, they said, that he had been planning the assassination for a long time.</p><p>Ms. Sihvola got Mr. Hull, the F.B.I. agent, to identify multiple references in the note to Mr. Routh’s belief that his plan would likely fail; those references were in parts of the note that prosecutors had not included in their memo asking the judge to detain Mr. Routh indefinitely.</p><p>Mr. Hull also acknowledged under questioning by Ms. Sihvola that he was not awareof any footage from surveillance or other cameras showing Mr. Routh at the golf course or with the rifle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Hull also disclosed that another handwritten note had been found perhaps 15 feet from the rifle. That note, he said, was addressed to The New York Times.</p><p>Mr. Dispoto called the second note “ancillary” and pointed out that it was not part of the government’s filing. Mr. Routh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/25/world/europe/volunteers-us-ukraine-lies.html" title="">was interviewed by The Times</a> last year about his efforts to recruit foreign fighters to Ukraine.</p><p>The developments on Monday painted the clearest picture to date of an itinerant and impoverished building contractor, with no apparent ties to Florida, who repeatedly professed his willingness to die defending Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Routh’s lawyers portrayed their client as dedicated to the cause of democracy in Ukraine and Taiwan, and added that, even after his arrest, he has the support of his adult children and siblings. He lived with a partner in Hawaii for the past eight years and spent “the better half of the past decade,” Ms. Militello said, “as a law-abiding citizen.”</p><p>Prosecutors noted Mr. Routh’s extensive criminal history, including a 2002 felony charge in North Carolina for possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction. Court documents described the weapon as a “binary explosive with a 10-inch detonation and a blasting cap.” Mr. Routh was convicted and placed on supervised probation for 60 months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Investigators who searched the black Nissan Xterra S.U.V. that Mr. Routh was driving on Sept. 15, found “a handwritten list of dates in August, September and October 2024 and venues where the former president had appeared or was expected to be present,” according to the prosecutors’ memo.</p><p>Agents also found six cellphones — including one that contained a Google search of how to travel from Palm Beach County to Mexico — as well as 12 pairs of gloves, a Hawaii driver’s license in Mr. Routh’s name and a passport.</p><p>Judge McCabe cited the Google search and Mr. Routh’s passport as evidence of his potential flight risk, and his criminal record, his apparent staking out of the golf course and the seriousness of the existing firearms charges against him as evidence of his potential danger to the community.</p><p>“The government has met its burden” to warrant detention, Judge McCabe said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
