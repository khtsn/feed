She has drawn support from Mr. Correa’s base of voters, who are eager to return to the prosperity and low homicide rates during his tenure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A supporter of the candidate Luisa González on the Boulevard of the United Nations in Quito on Wednesday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. González, a leftist establishment candidate handpicked by former President Rafael Correa, is Mr. Noboa’s main opponent.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But it also hurts her among other Ecuadoreans who remember Mr. Correa’s repressive tactics and corruption scandals. Many Noboa supporters put it simply: Ms. González represents the past, while Mr. Noboa represents the future.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Noboa’s party, which was created less than a year ago, is predicted to win about a third of the seats in the legislature — the same as Mr. Correa’s party.</p><p>For years Ecuador has been defined by Mr. Correa’s movement, but some say Mr. Noboa has the potential to create a political force of his own.</p><p>This is the first time since the Correa years that Ecuador has seen a relatively popular president seeking re-election, and it “creates the possibility for a type of political stability that Ecuador hasn’t seen really since Correa left office,” said Risa Grais-Targow, the Latin America director for Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.</p><p>Ecuadorean presidential elections typically feature two rounds of voting, with the two top candidates in the first round facing off in the second. To win the first round outright, a candidate must win more than 50 percent of the votes, or win 40 percent of the votes with a 10-point margin over the nearest rival.</p><p>Just five years ago, Mr. Noboa was a political unknown. After one term as a legislator, he rose unexpectedly from the bottom of the polls to a second-place finish in the first round of presidential elections in 2023, helped, in part, by a strong debate performance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Noboa waving to supporters after his visit to a market on Wednesday morning.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Military officers guarding the plaza where an event in support of Mr. Noboa’s candidacy was held Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Noboa, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate, comes from one of Ecuador’s wealthiest families. His father, Álvaro Noboa, who owns an economic empire that includes Bonita Bananas, also ran for president five times, unsuccessfully.</p><p>The younger man has been leading the country of nearly 18 million through a particularly bloody period.</p><p>Over the past five years, the drug-trafficking industry has expanded in Ecuador, drawing in international criminal groups, unleashing violence in the once-peaceful nation and sending tens of thousands of migrants fleeing to the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Two months after taking office, Mr. Noboa declared a state of internal armed conflict after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/world/americas/ecuador-gang-prison-emergency.html" title="">several prison riots and an on-air siege of a TV station</a>.</p><p>The drastic step, which allowed the military to patrol prisons and streets, was seen as a turning point. Some Ecuadoreans felt the measure was necessary to crack down on gang violence, while others worried it threatened civil liberties.</p><p>The move initially brought down violence in cities like Guayaquil, but the sense of safety did not last. January <a href="https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/seguridad/muertes-violentas-de-enero-2025-en-ecuador-superan-cifras-de-inicio-de-anos-anteriores-nota/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saw more violent deaths</a> than any month in the past three years, according to police data.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Phones, plastic guns and dozens of small bags of marijuana were seized in a police operation last year in the Guayaquil neighborhood of Suburbio.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Federico Rios for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In his short term, Mr. Noboa has faced  national and international controversies, an energy crisis, persistent drug-related violence and unemployment.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Federico Rios for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In April, Mr. Noboa dispatched police officers to the Mexican Embassy to arrest a politician who had taken refuge there to escape a prison sentence for corruption. Experts called the action a violation of international law on the sanctity of diplomatic missions, and the arrest drew global condemnation.</p><p>But in Ecuador, the moves boosted Mr. Noboa’s image as a tough-on-crime leader, and Ecuadoreans endorsed his hard-line approach later that month, when they approved a referendum enshrining the increased military presence into law and lengthening prison terms for certain offenses linked to organized crime.</p><p>“I think he is authoritarian,” said Cristina Guevara, 45, who cares full time for her disabled son. “But we want him to win because it is the only solution that there is going to be right now.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Noboa’s approach has been polarizing, and his <a href="https://www.perfilesdeopinion.com/images/pdf/presidente.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approval ratings</a> have been carved in half.</p><p>Many blamed his harsh strategy for the disappearance in December of four children who were forced into a military patrol car after they were seen playing soccer in the western province of Guayas. Their charred remains were found weeks later, and the case set off outrage and protests against the military.</p><p>A judge ordered the detention of 16 military members involved in the disappearance.</p><p>When it comes to his plans for the country, Mr. Noboa has provided little in the way of concrete promises, instead speaking vaguely about throwing “the old Ecuador” in the trash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>His success has been in creating a “character,” said Caroline Ávila, an Ecuadorean political analyst. “This character still does not tell the voter what country he wants to give you.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Young people with cardboard cutouts of Mr. Noboa in casual clothes outside the headquarters of his political party in Quito on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The posters are part of the president’s communication strategy ahead of Sunday’s election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Johanna Alarcón for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Verónica Díaz, the national coordinator of Mr. Noboa’s party, said one of his top plans was to <a href="https://x.com/DanielNoboaOk/status/1835737547231969400" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">change the Constitution</a> to lift a ban on foreign military bases.</p><p>Mr. Correa instituted the ban in 2008, pushing out a U.S. military presence that critics say was crucial for fighting international criminal groups.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Noboa is also openly feuding with his vice president, Verónica Abad, a right-wing business coach. Ecuadorean law requires presidents to cede their duties to the vice president while campaigning, but Mr. Noboa has refused to do so, citing an electoral law that he claimed allowed him to govern and campaign at the same time.</p><p>The constitutional court rejected that claim on Monday, so Mr. Noboa stopped officially campaigning.</p><p>Experts say some of Mr. Noboa’s actions are an overreach of executive authority that could be seen as authoritarian.</p><p>“He’s tended to push the limit in terms of both international and domestic constitutional norms,” said Ms. Grais-Targow. “But it’s always been done with the banner of security measures or transparency, which I think has helped to contain the political fallout for him.”</p><p>His supporters see him as a fearless leader willing to make bold decisions for the sake of the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>But Ledy Zúñiga, a former justice minister who is running for the National Assembly with Ms. González’s party, said weakening the country’s democratic norms only makes it harder to address the country’s violence.</p><p>“As long as the institutional framework of the security system is not strengthened, it is very difficult,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Noboa is also one of the few leaders in Latin America who seem to be on good terms with President Trump. He attended his inauguration and has accepted deportation flights.</p><p>Mr. Noboa’s decision not to actively campaign, following the court’s ruling, makes for an unusual scene on the trail.</p><p>On Wednesday, the plaza in suburban Quito was packed with thousands of people waiting to hear him speak. Because of the court’s decision, he never did.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>So he ate lunch in a food market while chatting with local vendors. Spectators quickly surrounded him, standing on chairs, snapping selfies and chanting campaign slogans.</p><p>“It was exciting because no president has ever come to this market before,” said Soledad Medina, 60, who sold the president juice. “He is very young and he is intelligent and would like our Ecuador to change. What we need is a change.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Noboa at a market on Wednesday.
