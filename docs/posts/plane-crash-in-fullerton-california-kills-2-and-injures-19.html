Mr. Torrez, 57, ran outside to see a horrific scene: a downed plane engulfed in flames as some of his colleagues frantically used extinguishers on three or four workers who had caught fire.</p><p>“We know most everybody but don’t know them well,” Mr. Torrez said of the workers, who he said worked in other parts of the warehouse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Many got burned,” he added. “I was scared.”</p><p>Officials estimated that as many as 300 people were evacuated from the building, which sustained major damage from the crash and fire. Nineteen people were treated for injuries, including some who were taken to the hospital, said Mike Meacham, a deputy chief with the Fullerton Fire Department.</p><p>The two people who were killed have not yet been identified, and it was not clear if they had been aboard the plane, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/02/us/fullerton-plane-02/fullerton-plane-02-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/02/us/fullerton-plane-02/fullerton-plane-02-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/02/us/fullerton-plane-02/fullerton-plane-02-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An aerial view of the damage to the building rooftop." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/02/us/fullerton-plane-02/fullerton-plane-02-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/02/us/fullerton-plane-02/fullerton-plane-02-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/02/us/fullerton-plane-02/fullerton-plane-02-jumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/02/us/fullerton-plane-02/fullerton-plane-02-superJumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2214fa3f-0806-5b94-8ab0-e6220220c484" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nineteen people were treated for injuries, including some who were taken to the hospital.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NBC4 Los Angeles – KNBC</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to Eliott Simpson, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, the plane had climbed to 900 feet before the pilot called for an immediate return to the airport.</p><p>The pilot then made a 180 degree left turn in an effort to return but crashed into the building about 1,000 feet short of the runway. He did not signal what might have been wrong with the plane before it crashed, Mr. Simpson said at a news conference on Thursday night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=703yy2Sm_HA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Surveillance footage obtained</a> by a local TV station from a nearby building showed the moment of impact, with the plane exploding in an enormous fireball as it struck the roof of the facility. Smoke could be seen billowing from a large hole in the roof in separate aerial footage from local TV.</p><p>The aircraft was a Van’s RV-10, a popular kit plane that owners can build and maintain themselves, Mr. Simpson said. The plane in Thursday’s crash was built in 2011, and the owner was listed as a resident of Huntington Beach, Calif. He could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Officials said it was unclear where the plane might have been going and added that weather very likely did not play a part in the crash. Mr. Simpson said the N.T.S.B. would continue its investigation on Friday and recover the aircraft by Friday evening.</p><p>There have been several crashes involving small planes flying in and out of the Fullerton Municipal Airport over the years.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-25/two-injured-in-small-plane-crash-near-fullerton-airport" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two people were injured</a> when a plane taking off from the airport made an emergency landing and crashed into a tree just one street away from site of Thursday’s collision. In 1995, the airport faced intense scrutiny after a plane trying to land there crashed into a townhouse complex, killing two people onboard and a third person inside the home.</p><p>Jack Begg<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Orlando Mayorquín is a breaking news reporter, based in New York, and a member of the 2023-24 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship class</a>, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/orlando-mayorquin">More about Orlando Mayorquín</a></span></p></div></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Deadly Toll on One Family: </strong>A large family suffered an unthinkable loss after landslides slammed into their North Carolina town during Hurricane Helene. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/hurricane-helene-craigtown-north-carolina-deaths.html">The survivors are trying to move forward</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mining Town Finds New Gold in Film: </strong>There was plenty of skepticism in Butte, Mont., when Hollywood producers began showing up to shoot their shows. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/butte-montana-filming-yellowstone-1923.html">Now, many say the industry’s arrival has been a boon</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assist or Resist?: </strong>With President-elect Donald Trump pledging to carry out mass deportations, local officials around the country are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/us/trump-deportations-migrants-san-diego.html">divided on how much to cooperate with immigration agents</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creating a Company Town: </strong>Over the past few years, Elon Musk has expanded his footprint in Texas.
