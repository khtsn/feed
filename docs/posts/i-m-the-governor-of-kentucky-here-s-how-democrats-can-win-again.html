While I’m deeply disappointed with the national result, I refuse to play the blame game. Campaigns are hard. Candidates and their families are put through hell. And all the candidates tried hard to win, even if they came up short.</p><p>What I offer instead is a way forward. I won re-election 12 months ago by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/07/us/elections/results-kentucky-governor.html" title="">five points</a> in a state that Donald Trump just carried by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-kentucky-president.html" title="">30 points</a>. And I did so at a time when inflation and illegal border crossings were higher than they are now. So how was it possible? Because the people of Kentucky know I care about them personally and, most important, that I am focused on what matters most in their daily lives. That’s a trust leaders must earn not only in their messaging but also in their everyday actions.</p><p>When most Americans wake up in the morning, they are not thinking about politics. Americans wake up thinking about their jobs and whether they make enough money to support their families. We wake up thinking about the next doctor’s appointment for ourselves, our parents or our kids. We wake up thinking about the roads and bridges we will drive on that day, wondering how safe they are and how much traffic we will see. We wake up thinking about the public school we will drop our kids off at, and we wake up thinking about public safety in our communities.</p><p>Yes, there are a lot of big, important issues facing our country, but when families are struggling in these core areas, it’s hard to focus on or reach anything else. If you are staring at the cost of your child’s prescription and wondering how you are going to pay for both it and your family’s dinner, the offense of the day in Washington, D.C. or the latest crazy thing a politician said just isn’t as important.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>So the way forward is not complicated, but it takes work and discipline. The focus of the Democratic Party must return to creating better jobs, more affordable and accessible health care, safer roads and bridges, the best education for our children and communities where people aren’t just safer but also feel safer.</p><p>We do this through policy and by taking direct action that gets results. In 2023, I expanded Medicaid in Kentucky to include vision, hearing and dental coverage and, throughout my time in office, have signed bills prioritizing mental health, capping the cost of insulin and expanding telehealth. I also worked with our private and nonprofit sectors in opening a pediatric autism center in Appalachia and just celebrated the opening of the first new hospital in one of our largest African American communities in 150 years. These are tangible results, where some seniors could finally afford dentures or glasses and parents didn’t have to drive two hours or take two buses to get their child to a doctor.</p><p>The Democratic Party must show the American people that it cares about creating a better life for each and every American and re-earn the public’s trust about its focus and its direction.</p><p>None of this means we abandon important values and principles. As governor, I have vetoed numerous anti-L.G.B.T.Q. and anti-choice <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/kentucky-abortion-bill-legislature-override-veto/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bills</a>, yet I still beat Mr. Trump’s handpicked candidate last fall. That happened because even if some voters might have disagreed with the vetoes, they knew the next day I would be announcing new jobs, opening a new health clinic or finishing a new road that would cut 20 minutes off their commute. They knew my focus and effort was on their daily needs and that our gains as a commonwealth would help every single one of our families.</p><p>Earning trust and showing people you care about them also requires that we talk to people like normal human beings. And that we are not afraid to share our “why.” For me, my why is my faith, and I share it proudly. I vetoed <a href="https://www.wkyufm.org/2023-03-29/ky-legislature-easily-overrides-all-gov-andy-beshears-vetoes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation</a> last year because I believe all children are children of God. And whether people agree with my decision, they know why I’m making it. They know where I am coming from.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>So while others are talking about political strategy and messaging, the way forward is really about focus and about action. The next several years are the Democratic Party’s chance to show the American people that we will not just run on but also govern by addressing those core issues that can and will improve the lives of our people. And perhaps the best part? These core issues and concerns aren’t partisan, and addressing them helps Democrats and Republicans alike. That’s a path forward for both the Democratic Party and for this country that we love.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
