Many people are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/style/gen-z-dating-apps.html" title="">longing for</a> organic, in-person connections, but they don’t necessarily know where to go.</p><p>The summertime in New York is a particularly fun and flirty season, when many people seem to be more open to new interactions and spend more time outside. So at the start of the summer, we put together a list of buzzy places in the city where it’s common to strike up a conversation with a stranger.</p><p>Now that the summer is almost over, we want to hear from people who had a romantic spark with a stranger in person over the last couple of months. Where was the meet-cute? Was it at one of the places we recommended? Did it result in a summer fling, or something more?</p></div></div><div><p>Share your rom-com experience using the form below, and a reporter may be in touch for an upcoming story.
