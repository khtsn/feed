The handbag also held her driver’s license, medication, apartment keys and blank checks.</p><p>The theft is the latest episode to raise questions about the performance of the Secret Service, which has been under intense scrutiny since President Trump was the target of two assassination attempts last year. It is not clear how the thief was able to get so close to Ms. Noem and walk out with her bag under the eyes of the agents on the scene.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Asked why Ms. Noem was carrying so much cash, Ms. McLaughlin said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren. She was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.”</p><p>Ms. Noem runs a department that is in charge of the nation’s security, including border control and immigration and terrorism protection.</p><p>By virtue of her position, she also has a round-the-clock security detail. According to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Secret Service’s investigation, agents were present in the restaurant at the time of the theft.</p><p>The official added that footage from the restaurant’s security cameras showed the person who stole Ms. Noem’s bag was wearing what a law enforcement official described as a “Covid-style mask,” obscuring parts of his face. The official said the investigation had produced some leads.</p><p>Staff members at the Capital Burger declined to take a call about the incident.</p><p>The restaurant, one of several Capital Burger locations along the East Coast, is owned by Darden Restaurants, an Orlando, Fla.-based operator that also owns the Capital Grille and the Olive Garden, among other dining brands. A spokesman for Darden Restaurants did not immediately return a call for comment.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>No Plans to Fire Powell: </strong>The president said he has “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-jerome-powell-fed.html">no intention” of ousting Jerome Powell</a>, the Federal Reserve chair, but the administration’s willingness to challenge norms regarding the central bank’s political independence is causing concern.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Agency Angst: </strong>The Trump administration has deployed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/eeoc-trump-dei-law-firms.html">to seek retribution against corporate law firms.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>I.M.F. and World Bank: </strong>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/business/bessent-imf-world-bank-overhauls.html">called for major overhauls to the missions</a> of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank but said that the United States remained committed to maintaining its leadership role at the global economic institutions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Active Research Awards Terminated:</strong> The National Science Foundation canceled more than 400 active awards, according to a list obtained by The Times.
