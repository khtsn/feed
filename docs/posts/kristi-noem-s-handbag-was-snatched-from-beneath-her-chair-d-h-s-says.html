The handbag also held Ms. Noem’s driver’s license, medication, apartment keys and blank checks.</p><p>Asked why Ms. Noem was carrying so much cash, Ms. McLaughlin said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren. She was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.”</p></div></div>
