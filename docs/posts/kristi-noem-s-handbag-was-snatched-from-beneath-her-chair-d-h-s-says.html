    <h1>Kristi Noem’s Handbag Was Snatched From Beneath Her Chair, D.H.S. Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asked why Ms. Noem was carrying so much cash, Ms. McLaughlin said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren. She was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.”</p><p>Ms. Noem runs a department that is in charge of the nation’s security, including border control and immigration and terrorism protection.</p><p>By virtue of her position, she also has a round-the-clock security detail. According to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Secret Service’s investigation, agents were present in the restaurant at the time of the theft.</p><p>The official added that footage from the restaurant’s security cameras showed the person who stole Ms. Noem’s bag was wearing what a law enforcement official described as a “Covid-style mask,” obscuring parts of his face. The official said the investigation had produced some leads.</p><p>Staff members at the Capital Burger declined to take a call about the incident.</p><p>The restaurant, one of several Capital Burger locations along the East Coast, is owned by Darden Restaurants, an Orlando, Fla.-based operator that also owns the Capital Grille and the Olive Garden, among other dining brands. A spokesman for Darden Restaurants did not immediately return a call for comment.</p></div></div>
