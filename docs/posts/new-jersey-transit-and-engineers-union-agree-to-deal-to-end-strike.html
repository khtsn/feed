An announcement by Gov. Philip D. Murphy was expected Sunday night.</p><p>Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the union, confirmed that its members would return to work on Monday. Another person close to the negotiations said a deal had been reached Sunday evening and would be announced by the governor.</p><p>The engineers still must ratify the terms of the new contract, which they have failed to do once already.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The engineers walked out at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, bringing New Jersey’s network of commuter train lines to a halt and leaving thousands of commuters scrambling to find other ways of getting to work. NJ Transit, the nation’s third-largest commuter railroad, said it carried about 350,000 passengers a day, including about 70,000 who ride its trains into Manhattan on a typical weekday.</p><p>The engineers’ union had been holding out for a new contract for more than five years, demanding to be paid on par with their counterparts at other railroads that serve New York City. It was the only one of 15 unions that represent NJ Transit employees that had not come to terms with the agency in recent years.</p><p>The agency had created a contingency plan involving chartered buses running from four satellite locations into New York City or to stations on the PATH commuter train service. But that plan had not been tested because it was scheduled to be used for the first time on Monday morning.</p><p>New Jersey Transit’s new chief executive, Kris Kolluri, had implored customers to work from home during the strike if possible because the chartered buses would only be able to accommodate about one-fifth of the usual New York-bound train riders. Some large companies agreed to allow employees to work from home during the strike if their presence in the workplace was not consider essential.</p><p>But on Friday morning, commuters got a taste of how disruptive a prolonged strike might be. People arrived at train stations unaware that the trains were not running, leaving them annoyed and unsure how they would get to work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In addition to commuter hassle, the strike had also threatened to cause economic damage to the New York area.</p><p>The Partnership for New York City, which represents large employers, said each hour that New Jersey Transit’s rail commuters were delayed in getting to work reduced overall productivity in the city by $6 million.</p><p>State officials and union leaders blamed each other for the breakdown in talks on Thursday night that spurred the strike.</p><p>Governor Murphy castigated the union, saying, “It is frankly a mess of their own making and it is a slap in the face of every commuter and worker who relies on NJ Transit.”</p><p>The union’s general chairman, Thomas Haas, and Mr. Kolluri announced in March that they had reached a tentative agreement that would head off a strike. Mr. Kolluri said that deal would have raised the engineers’ average annual pay to $172,000, from $135,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the engineers overwhelmingly rejected the terms of that agreement in April, reviving the threat of a walkout. Mr. Haas said the agency’s representatives had walked away from the bargaining table on Thursday night, leaving his members no alternative but to leave NJ Transit with nobody to drive its trains.</p><p>Bill Dwyer, an associate teaching professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said that the engineers had probably gained the upper hand in the bargaining, at least temporarily, by walking out.</p><p>Shutting down the railroad “gives the union additional leverage because the ridership is not going to be happy,” Professor Dwyer said. The transit agency’s customers, he added, are “going to be very impatient” about having their service restored.</p><p>Still, he said, New Jersey Transit could retaliate by cutting off payments for the engineers’ health insurance. Striking workers would start to feel the financial pinch of not getting paid after a couple of weeks, he said. Having to cover their own health-care costs could compound that discomfort quickly.</p><p>But it never came to that, as the two sides met for much of the weekend to try to resolve their differences before feeling the accumulating frustration of dislocated commuters.</p><p>After holding an abruptly scheduled meeting on Saturday afternoon, they met again on Sunday in a session mediated by the National Mediation Board, which had been involved in the talks since Monday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the economy of New York City and its airports and other transportation hubs.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
