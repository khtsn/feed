An announcement by Gov. Philip D. Murphy was expected Sunday night.</p><p>The engineers still must ratify the terms of the new contract, which they have failed to do once already.</p><p>The engineers walked out at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, bringing New Jersey’s network of commuter train lines to a halt and leaving thousands of commuters scrambling to find other ways of getting to work. NJ Transit, the nation’s third-largest commuter railroad, said it carried about 350,000 passengers a day, including about 70,000 who ride its trains into Manhattan on a typical weekday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the economy of New York City and its airports and other transportation hubs.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
