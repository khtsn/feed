    <h1>Netanyahu Travels to Israeli-Controlled Syria, His Office Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu met with Israel’s defense minister, the Israeli military chief of staff and other officials “on the Hermon ridge,” according to a statement on Tuesday from his office, which did not specify the exact location of the meeting. “The prime minister reviewed the I.D.F. deployment in the area and set guidelines for the future,” it said.</p><p>Israel has given no timeline for its forces’ departure from the area and said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/12/world/syria-news-assad-rebels#israel-syria-buffer-zone-assad" title="">they would stay</a> until its security demands were met.</p><p>At the same time, Israeli planes have conducted waves of airstrikes aimed at destroying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/10/world/syria-news-assad-rebels" title="">Syrian military assets</a>, including its navy, air force, tanks, weapons production facilities and air defense systems.</p><p>Israel’s government has argued that it is attempting to protect civilians who live in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights and to guard against any threats that could potentially emanate from Syria. Israel seized the Golan Heights during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and the area is considered illegally occupied under international law.</p><p>This week, the Israeli government also approved a plan by Mr. Netanyahu to expand settlements in the part of the Golan Heights that it controls, a move that could double the area’s population.</p></div></div>
