They held signs, including one that said, “Daniel Penny deserves a prize not a prison.” On the other side were people protesting on behalf of Mr. Neely. Upset, they grabbed a sign and ripped it up.</p><p>As the sides exchanged barbs and police officers erected a barrier to separate them, inside the courthouse 12 New Yorkers were coming to a unanimous decision. Mr. Penny, they concluded, was not guilty.</p><p>If the death of Mr. Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man who had struggled with mental health problems, had left New Yorkers unnerved and divided, the verdict quickly became yet another flashpoint in the nation’s debate over how best to address issues of crime and justice, homelessness and mental illness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Republican political figures including Vice President-elect JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr. and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised the jury and criticized the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, for pursuing the case.</p><p>“Thank God justice was done in this case,” Mr. Vance said on social media. “It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.”</p><p>Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Penny a hero who deserved a medal.</p><p>But in New York, some found the verdict deeply troubling. “This decision highlights a deep-seated societal discomfort with unhoused individuals in need of support, and effectively green-lights ‘vigilante justice’ against the most vulnerable New Yorkers,” leaders of the City Council’s Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters and supporters outside the trial of Daniel Penny, in New York on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Penny and Mr. Neely encountered each other on the afternoon of May 1, 2023. Mr. Penny, an architecture student, had left class and was on his way to the gym when he boarded an uptown train. Mr. Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, entered the subway car and immediately began yelling about his hunger, according to witnesses, many of whom described his behavior as frightening.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As Mr. Neely strode through the car, shouting about wanting to return to jail and not caring if he lived or died, Mr. Penny approached Mr. Neely from behind and put him in a chokehold, taking him to the floor.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/nyregion/jordan-neely-daniel-penny-nyc-subway.html" title="">four-minute video quickly circulated online</a>, showing the two men struggling on the floor of the subway train, and New Yorkers viewed the incident through distinctly different lenses.</p><p>Some residents saw Mr. Neely as the embodiment of a system that had broken down, letting vulnerable people slip through the cracks. Mr. Neely was on a city list <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/13/nyregion/jordan-neely-top-50-mental-illness.html" title="">informally known as the Top 50</a>, a small number of people in a city of eight million who stand out for the severity of their troubles and their resistance to accepting help.</p><p>For others, it was emblematic of a string of high-profile crimes on the city’s subways, many involving homeless and mentally ill people, and evidence of the city’s inability to keep residents safe. In recent years, Mayor Eric Adams has responded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/nyregion/subway-national-guard-police.html" title="">flooding the system with police officers</a>, using gun-detecting technology <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/nyregion/subway-gun-scanner-nyc.html" title="">to scan riders</a> and dispatching teams to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/nyregion/nyc-subway-mental-health-homeless.html" title="">remove mentally ill people from the system</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Public safety officers, including from the New York State Police and the National Guard, flooded Penn Station in March.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Gray for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In an interview with detectives, Mr. Penny told officers that he had acted because he believed that Mr. Neely posed a threat to others on the train.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Prosecutors did not contest the likely motivation behind Mr. Penny’s actions. Dafna Yoran, an assistant district attorney, said during the trial that Mr. Penny’s initial efforts to restrain Mr. Neely might have been “even laudable.” Mr. Penny’s actions became criminal, prosecutors said, when he continued to hold Mr. Neely long after subway passengers had left the car and he was no longer an immediate threat.</p><p>Throughout the trial, Mr. Penny’s lawyers, Steven Raiser and Thomas A. Kenniff, hailed their client as a protector and said that Mr. Neely’s death was caused by an amalgam of his synthetic marijuana use, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/nyregion/daniel-penny-defense-jordan-neely.html" title="">sickle cell trait</a> and mental illness.</p><p>Prosecutors had initially charged Mr. Penny with manslaughter, but the judge dismissed that charge Friday when the jury deadlocked. Jurors were sent back to consider a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide and, on Monday, ultimately acquitted him.</p><p>In a statement following the verdict, Mr. Bragg said that he and his office “deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“As with every case, we followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end,” he said.</p><p>Cheryl Bader, a professor at Fordham Law School, said that the jurors’ inability to come to a unanimous decision on the manslaughter charge indicated that perhaps they did not see the case as the same “binary choice” that the public might.</p><p>The length of time they deliberated and the notes they sent to the judge for clarification suggests that jurors were looking at the case in a “more complex way,” she said. And sometimes in complex cases, she said, the lack of certainty for jurors translates into reasonable doubt.</p><p>Bennett L. Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School, said that from the moment prosecutors charged Mr. Penny last year, he expected that the case would result in either a hung jury or an acquittal — “I guess I was right on both,” he said on Monday.</p><p>The charges against Mr. Penny, for an episode that took place in a crowded subway car and in the midst of a volatile situation, would have been “very, very difficult for jurors to handle,” he said.</p><p>“They involve putting yourself into an individual’s mind,” Mr. Gershman said.</p><p>But public response to the verdict fell along familiarly divided lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1657212176178855939?s=46&amp;t=tnfUg9JQzx6cuKAZa6vDbA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida,</a> who likened Mr. Penny to the Bible’s good Samaritan last year, called the verdict “<a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1866165414549737485" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just and correct.</a>” Kyle Rittenhouse, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/19/us/kyle-rittenhouse-trial" title="">who in 2021 was acquitted</a> of killing two people and wounding another at a Black Lives Matter rally in Wisconsin, <a href="https://x.com/ThisIsKyleR/status/1866161098619072992" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">congratulated Mr. Penny in a post on X</a>.</p><p>While preparing for Mr. Penny’s case, his legal team hired an expert who had helped in Mr. Rittenhouse’s case: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/nyregion/daniel-penny-jury-consultant-ny-subway-choking.html" title="">Jo-Ellan Dimitrius</a>, a jury consultant known for working on high-profile trials. Throughout her decades-long career, Ms. Dimitrius had also consulted for lawyers for O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted on charges that he had killed his ex-wife and her friend.</p><p>On Monday, Ms. Dimitrius and her business partner, Randy Peukert, said they were “elated” at the news.</p><p>“A good cross-section of New York citizens came to the right decision,” Ms. Dimitrius said, adding, “It would appear that the citizens of New York are fed up with the crime that they encounter literally on a daily basis.”</p><p>But Neil Berry, a leader with VOCAL-NY, a group that is an advocate for low-income New Yorkers affected by drug use and H.I.V. and AIDS, said the verdict “sets the stage for this to happen again: for more homeless people, or even just loud kids, to be shot or killed because they are perceived to be potential threats.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Vera Kahn, 28, attended a demonstration Monday evening to protest the verdict. She said she remembered seeing Mr. Neely on the subway, first as a performance artist and later as a homeless man in desperate need of help.</p><p>“In a weird way, the people who beg on the trains are some of the most known people in the city,” she said. “He’s just a person that I used to see around and now he’s dead, and it’s just — it’s just wrong.”</p><p>Donte Mills, a lawyer for Mr. Neely’s father, described the verdict as painful.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andre Zachery, center, the father of Jordan Neely, outside the courthouse after Mr. Penny was found not guilty.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I was sitting next to Jordan’s father when they announced the verdict and I felt his heart break again because there was a belief that the jury valued Jordan enough to hold his killer responsible,” Mr. Mills said. “That belief? It was just — it was shattered,” he said.</p><p>Last Wednesday, while the jury was still deliberating, Mr. Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/jordan-neely-father-daniel-penny-lawsuit-assault.html" title="">filed a lawsuit against Mr. Penny</a> for “negligence, carelessness and recklessness.” In the wake of the verdict, Mr. Mills said, the family would shift its efforts to their next legal battle.</p><p>Wesley Parnell<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and criminal justice in the New York region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hurubie-meko">More about Hurubie Meko</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
