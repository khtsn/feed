The last two, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/12/climate/nuclear-reactors-clean-energy.html" title="">built in Georgia</a>, arrived seven years late and cost around $35 billion, more than twice as much as planned. Others have fared even worse: Utilities spent roughly $9 billion on two nuclear reactors in South Carolina before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/climate/nuclear-power-project-canceled-in-south-carolina.html" title="">abandoning the project in 2017</a>.</p><p>If Constellation and others succeed in scaling up nuclear power — currently around 19 percent of the U.S. electricity mix — the result would largely be due to the financial backing of some of the world’s most valuable companies.

The company had them inspected in May and said it found no corrosion.</p><p>The main power transformers that connect the plant to the grid will need to be replaced at a cost of around $100 million. The plant is also getting a new name: the Crane Clean Energy Center.</p><p>“We know how to run this reactor, so as long as the equipment is in good shape, the level of complexity here is — I would describe it as significantly lower than building a new reactor,” Mr. Dominguez said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Unexpected hurdles could arise, and meaningfully expanding nuclear capacity would require not only reviving shuttered reactors but also building new ones.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Constellation’s chief executive said the cost of restarting the plant, to be called the Crane Clean Energy Center, was “significantly lower than building a new reactor.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Just one reactor besides Palisades and Three Mile Island is considered to be in good enough shape for revival: NextEra Energy’s Duane Arnold plant near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which shut down in 2020.</p><p>The company is “very interested” in restarting it, NextEra’s chief executive, John W. Ketchum, said recently. Still, he noted that “new resources need to be built to meet new demand.”</p><p>To make it more economically feasible to build reactors, companies will need to manufacture many of them rather than one-off models, the Energy Department has said. Adding new reactors to existing nuclear sites would further reduce costs and other hurdles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Mr. Dominguez said Constellation was exploring with clients what such an undertaking would entail, including who would shoulder certain risks.</p><p>“We’ll pick a technology that we think is being successfully deployed by others and where we have a chance to effectively buy the next, call it the next six, units from a company that’s already built the first six,” Mr. Dominguez said.</p><p>Some investors remain wary.</p><p>“We’re going to need new nuclear,” said Bobby Edemeka, a portfolio manager at investment manager Jennison Associates, which holds around $300 million in Constellation stock. But, he added, “I personally won’t be investing in those companies that are building new nuclear until the industry has proven that it’s possible to get these done on time and on budget.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rebecca F.
