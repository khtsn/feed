But persistent outbreaks of sectarian violence have stoked fears among Syria’s many minority groups that the country’s new government, which mostly belongs to the Sunni Arab majority, will not or cannot protect them from extremist groups in Syria.</p><p>Dozens of people were killed in late April when Islamist fighters attacked neighborhoods around Damascus, the capital, which are home to many in the country’s Druse minority. On Wednesday, Israel launched airstrikes and threatened to strike Syrian government forces in defense of the Druse.</p><p>The attacks came two months after thousands of extremist fighters killed around 1,600 people mostly from the country’s Alawite minority on the Syrian coast, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war-monitoring group based in Britain.</p><p>Some of those fighters appeared to be among the more extremist factions of the rebel coalition that toppled the Assad regime, according to war monitors. Despite the new authorities’ promises to integrate all rebel factions into a new national army, many of the more extremist armed groups remain outside the government’s control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Several prominent Syrian minorities — including the Druse, the Alawites and the Kurds — have also formed armed groups of their own. Both the Druse and the Kurds established militias during the country’s nearly-14-year civil war and have not laid down their arms since the war ended. Some Alawite former members of the Assad regime have also taken up arms against the new government.</p><p>Here’s what to know about Syria’s diverse minority communities.</p><h2 id="link-3597d5">Druse</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A funeral procession of killed Druse fighters, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Druse, who are a significant minority in Syria and in several neighboring countries, practice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/middleeast/druse-golan-heights-israel.html" title="">a centuries-old offshoot of Islam</a>.</p><p>Several powerful Druse militias with tens of thousands of fighters effectively control the rugged province of Sweida, southwest of the capital. Sweida is the heartland of the Druse and a strategically important region bordering Jordan and near Israel.</p><p>Many Druse also live in towns on the outskirts of Damascus. The outbreak of violence this week in two of those areas, Jaramana and Sahnaya, erupted after an audio clip circulated on social media purporting to be of a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The cleric denied the accusation, and Syria’s Interior Ministry said its initial findings showed that he was not the person in the clip.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israel’s government has close relations with the Druse community in Israel and has offered to protect the Druse in Syria should they come under attack.

Many Sunnis associate the Alawites with the old regime and its brutal attacks on their communities during the country’s civil war. Some Sunni extremists and foreign jihadists, who fought alongside the rebels during the war, also consider Alawites to be heretics.</p><p>The Alawites are predominately concentrated on Syria’s Mediterranean coast.</p><p>A bout of sectarian violence on the coast broke out in March, after armed groups affiliated with the ousted Assad regime launched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/middleeast/syria-clashes-assad.html" title="">a coordinated attack</a> on the new government’s forces in the area. The government then sent reinforcements to the region.</p><p>In the chaos, thousands of other extremist fighters and armed civilians flooded to the coast and carried out a killing spree targeting Alawites. It was the deadliest outbreak of sectarian violence since the rebels seized power and highlighted how tenuous the government’s control is over the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At least some government soldiers deployed to restore order also participated in the killings, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/middleeast/syria-alawite-massacre.html" title="">according to a Syrian government official and residents interviewed by The New York Times</a>.</p><h2 id="link-36e7ec">Kurds</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish people holding flags depicting a Kurdish leader jailed in Turkey, gathered in northeastern Syria, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The Kurds, who make up about 10 percent of Syria’s population, are one of Syria’s largest ethnic minorities. With U.S. support, they have for years run an autonomous region in northeastern Syria, an area with a mixed population of Arabs and Kurds. There are also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/world/middleeast/the-kurds-facts-history.html" title="">large Kurdish populations in Turkey</a>, Iraq and Iran, but there is no country with a Kurdish majority.</p><p>The Kurdish-led militia that governs much of northeastern <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/world/middleeast/syria-kurds-agreement.html" title="">Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces, agreed in March to integrate its military and other institutions</a>, including its prized oil and gas fields, under the central government’s control by year’s end. It was a major breakthrough for the new Syrian president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/middleeast/syria-president-ahmed-al-shara.html" title="">Ahmed al-Shara</a>.</p><p>But among Syria’s Kurds, suspicion of the country’s new leadership runs deep. Mr. al-Shara and other former rebels were once affiliated with Al Qaeda, which fought against the Kurds in Syria and Iraq. Some Kurds are also wary because the new government is aligned with its powerful neighbor, Turkey, which considers Syria’s Kurds to be allied with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/world/middleeast/pkk-kurdish-cease-fire-turkey.html" title="">Kurdish militants</a> inside Turkey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For the past several years, Turkey has been launching air attacks on Syrian Kurdish-led forces across the border and has also supported Syrian proxy forces against the Kurds. The Turkish military kept up some airstrikes even after Mr. al-Shara and the S.D.F. leader, Mazloum Abdi, signed the merger accord, though it has since suspended the attacks.</p><p>Members of the Kurdish-led regional government have described the agreement as merely a first step.</p><h2 id="link-4ad73e3">Christians</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration in the Bab Touma neighborhood of Damascus, on Christmas Eve, after reports of a burning of a Christmas tree by masked men in the town of Suqaylabiyah in the Hama governorate.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Christian population of Syria dates back thousands of years.
