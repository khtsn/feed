He has risen to TV fame as a hard-to-impress and ruthlessly unsentimental judge on the popular cooking competition, which features 100 contestants from all corners of the culinary world. “Culinary Class Wars” feels like “Iron Chef” meets “Survivor.” It manufactures a class struggle, pitting renowned chefs against undiscovered talents like a school cafeteria cook.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
