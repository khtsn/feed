The Mono Inn restaurant and Tioga Lodge hotel, two popular establishments, had also been evacuated, according to the Mono County Sheriff’s Office. The restaurant and the hotel sit just off Highway 395, the major artery in the region that was expected to remain closed through Friday afternoon, officials said.</p><p>Highway 395 was closed mainly because of safety reasons, Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for Inyo National Forest, told the local news organization Sierra Wave Media on Friday. “Power lines have burned, power lines are down across the highway,” she said. “We have to helicopter power line poles in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The fire was spreading slowly through a landscape of mostly sagebrush in a northern direction toward Mono City. Chloe Castillo, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire, said firefighting efforts were focused on containing the fire’s north end. “It’s creeping and smoldering in that area,” she said.</p><p>Helicopters were pulling water from Mono Lake and Lundy Lake on Thursday and Friday and dropping it on the flames, Ms. Cox said. Air tankers have also been assisting and releasing flame retardant, but not over Mono Lake and Mill Creek.</p><p>“This fire has the potential to get larger and it has the potential to move, so we’re trying to make as much progress as quickly as we can today,” Ms. Cox said on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-inn_mono_ca" data-id="100000010188593" data-source-id="100000010188593"><div slug="2022-wildfire-embed-embed-inn_mono_ca" data-sourceid="100000010188593" id="embed-id-100000010188593">

Winds up to 35 miles per hour pushed wildfire flames.</p><p>“It’s not as gusty today,” said Mark Deutschendorf, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nev. “Looks like one site near the fire is gusting to 17 miles per hour.”</p><p>Light winds are expected to continue overnight and into Saturday morning with winds of 20 m.p.h. or less.
