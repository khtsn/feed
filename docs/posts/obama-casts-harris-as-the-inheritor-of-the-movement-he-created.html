Speech</h2><h4>Former President Barack Obama blamed politicians and social media algorithms for deepening social and political divisions among Americans.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>We live in a time of such confusion and rancor, with a culture that puts a premium on things that don’t last: money, fame, status, likes. We chase the approval of strangers on our phones. We build all manner of walls and fences around ourselves, and then we wonder why we feel so alone. We don’t trust each other as much because we don’t take the time to know each other. And in that space between us, politicians and algorithms teach us to caricature each other. Control each other and fear each other. But here’s the good news, Chicago. All across America, in big cities and small towns away from all the noise, the ties that bind us together are still there. We still coach Little League and look out for our elderly neighbors. We still feed the hungry in churches and mosques and synagogues and temples. We share the same pride when our Olympic athletes compete for the gold because — because the vast majority of us do not want to live in a country that’s bitter and divided. We want something better. We want to be better. And the joy, and the excitement that we’re seeing around this campaign tells us we’re not alone.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/20/multimedia/20vid-dnc2-obama-unity-ltmp/20vid-dnc2-obama-unity-ltmp-square640-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Former President Barack Obama blamed politicians and social media algorithms for deepening social and political divisions among Americans.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-e-sanger"><img alt="David E.

Kennedy at his 1961 inaugural, months before Mr. Obama was born. “Now it’s up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in. And make no mistake: It will be a fight.”</p><p>It was the first of many warnings that the wave of enthusiasm and rising poll numbers for Ms. Harris might not be enough to avoid a tight outcome in 11 weeks, and that former President Donald J. Trump would try to manipulate the numbers and steal the election unless Ms. Harris won an overwhelming victory.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“We don’t need four more years of bluster and chaos,” Mr. Obama said. He later needled Mr. Trump for what he called “the childish nicknames and crazy conspiracy theories and weird obsession with crowd size. It just goes on and on.”</p><p>Mrs. Obama recalled how Mr. Trump “did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.” And then she asked: “Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs?”</p></div></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Michelle Obama Speaks on Second Night of Democratic Convention</h2><h4>The former first lady delivered a takedown of former President Donald J.

And in the vast hall of the United Center, the enthusiasm for that era contrasted in tone and power with the farewell given the previous night to President Biden.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Yet it was lost on no one that Mr. Obama has played a role in pushing Mr. Biden, his former vice president, to abandon his candidacy and turn the race over to Ms. Harris, who is 22 years younger than the sitting president.</p><p>For all the enthusiasm among Democrats for the Obamas, history suggests that their ability to transfer their own popularity to another candidate is limited. Mr. Obama came to national prominence in 2004, giving a keynote address to the Democratic convention in Boston as it nominated Senator John F. Kerry to take on President George W. Bush. Yet Mr. Kerry lost, narrowly.</p><p>In 2016, leaving office, Mr. Obama made an impassioned case for Hillary Clinton, his onetime political rival and then his secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Now Mr. Obama saw a new opportunity to revive the aura of his own run, in the first major-party presidential nomination of a Black woman in American history.</p><p>The Obamas took the stage after an appearance by Ms. Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, who had the familiar convention task of sharing the more personal side of his spouse with the party faithful — and the prime-time television audience.</p></div></div><div><p>He described the details of his first, awkward, overlong phone message to her seeking a date, and followed with a touching scene of Ms. Harris, inside the vice president’s residence, setting aside the business of the day to take a long call from his daughter (and her stepdaughter), Ella.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Doug Emhoff told the story of how he met Kamala Harris and left her a voice mail message that she saved — and makes him listen to every year on their anniversary.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>In 2013, I walked into a contentious client meeting. We worked through the issue, and by the end of the meeting, the now happy client offered to set me up on a blind date — [laughter] which is how I ended up with Kamala Harris’s phone number. Now, for generations, people have debated when to call the person you’re being set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30 a.m. And yet, that’s when I dialed. I got Kamala’s voicemail, and I just started rambling. “Hey, it’s Doug. I’m on my way to an early meeting. Again, it’s Doug.” I remember I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth. And for what seemed like far too many minutes, I hung up. By the way, Kamala saved that voicemail, and she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/20/us/politics/20vid-dnc-42057-emhoff/20vid-dnc-42057-emhoff-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Doug Emhoff told the story of how he met Kamala Harris and left her a voice mail message that she saved — and makes him listen to every year on their anniversary.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p>As with much of the Democratic convention this year, the evening was relatively devoid of any discussion of policy — a sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign eight years ago, and even Mr. Biden’s in 2020.</p><p>There were two notable exceptions. The convention organizers highlighted stories from women — including Mrs. Obama — who said that in vitro fertilization treatments allowed them to have children, and from others who told horror stories of medical emergencies in states that would not allow abortions.</p><p>The other exception was Mr. Obama. He made the case that Ms. Harris “helped take on the drug companies to cap the cost of insulin, lower the cost of health care and give families with kids a tax cut.” He said she had “real plans” to cut costs more.</p></div></div><div><div><p>And then he turned to what he called a “broader idea of freedom” that included “the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and send your kids to school without worrying if they’ll come home.” He portrayed the Democrats as the party of nonintervention — one that allows Americans to decide “how we worship, what our family looks like, how many kids we have, who we marry.”</p><p>In short, Mr. Obama cast Mr. Trump’s Republican Party as more authoritarian than libertarian. He cast the Democrats, once known the party of regulation, as the guarantors of personal freedom. It is unclear whether voters are willing to entertain that vision of the Democratic Party’s role. And Mr. Obama’s mission on Tuesday evening was far larger than what he sought to accomplish during a packed political convention in 2016.</p><p>Back then, he was extolling the talents of Mrs. Clinton and warning of the dangers of Mr. Trump, who was widely assumed by Democrats in the room to be easily beaten. In a sense, he was handing off a baton, with the strength of the presidency behind him.</p><p>This time, he made clear that despite his “passing the torch” line, it would take far more to defeat Mr. Trump for the second time in four years.</p><p>“For all the incredible energy we’ve been able to generate over the last few weeks, this will still be a tight race in a closely divided country,” Mr. Obama said. “A country where too many Americans are still struggling and don’t believe government can help.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David E.
