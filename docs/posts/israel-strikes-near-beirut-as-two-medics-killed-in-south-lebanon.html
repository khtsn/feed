area near Beirut dominated by Hezbollah, while in the country’s south, Israeli airstrikes killed two paramedics, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.</p><p>There was no immediate word on casualties from the Israeli strikes on the Dahiya, a predominantly Shiite Muslim area south of Beirut that has come under repeated Israeli attacks in past days. Israel has said these strikes are targeting facilities used by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite militia that holds sway in the Dahiya. It has accused the group of hiding “terrorist infrastructure” in residential areas.</p><p>The attacks on Dahiya came as Israel issued a <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1857665549108715833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new flurry of</a> <a href="https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1857717115576263085" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evacuation warnings</a> to local residents and after a round of strikes overnight on the area.</p><p>At the same time, there was growing anger within Lebanon over the mounting numbers of rescue workers killed by Israel in recent weeks. On Saturday, Lebanon’s health ministry condemned the killings of rescue workers as “barbaric attacks” and urged the international community to “ensure respect for international humanitarian laws.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israeli strikes have killed almost two dozen rescuers in the past week, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. And more than 145 health care workers in Lebanon have been killed while on duty since the war began in mid-September, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>One of the paramedics was killed on Saturday in the southern Lebanese town of Kfar Tibnit, according to the health ministry, which said that two more paramedics in the same town were missing and unaccounted for. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deaths.</p><p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, also denounced the killings of at least a dozen paramedics this week in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/world/middleeast/israel-syria-lebanon-strikes.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">a single airstrike</a> on a building used by emergency workers in the village of Douris in the Baalbek region of northeastern Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A funeral on Saturday for Lebanese rescue workers who were killed this week in an Israeli airstrike that hit their facility in the village of Douris in northeastern Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nidal Solh/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“We deplore the attack on the Lebanese Civil Defense center in Douris village,” <a href="https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1857532542439612677" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a> in a statement on Friday. “The center has been massively damaged. Attacks on health care are becoming the new normal in conflicts. This must stop — everywhere!”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Israel, air raid sirens sounded across the country’s north on Saturday as Hezbollah launched new drone and rocket attacks over the border. Israel’s military said the munitions either fell in areas that caused little damage or were intercepted by its air defense systems, creating thundering midair explosions that could be heard in the major northern city of Haifa.</p><p>Hezbollah began near daily rocket attacks on Israel last October in solidarity with its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. The conflict intensified in mid-September when Israel stepped up attacks on Hezbollah, culminating in a ground invasion of Lebanon on Oct. 1.</p><p>The war has driven roughly one million Lebanese from their homes, and Hezbollah’s rocket attacks on the north of Israel have displaced tens of thousands of Israelis.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">days-long bombing campaign</a> of the neighborhoods south of Beirut has complicated U.S. diplomatic efforts for a truce. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-strikes-hezbollah.html" title="">The Biden administration has recently renewed its efforts</a> to broker a cease-fire. But there has so far been no public indication that Hezbollah or its patron, Iran, are willing to accept Israel’s demands, which include the withdrawal of Hezbollah from the Israel-Lebanon border.</p><p>Israel also wants any cease-fire deal to stipulate that it has the right to attack Hezbollah if the group violates the agreement, a demand rejected by both the armed group and the Lebanese government, which is not a party to the conflict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A prominent Iranian official, Ali Larijani, met on Friday with Lebanese officials in Beirut to discuss the cease-fire efforts, the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon said. Mr. Larijani, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, passed messages to Hezbollah from Mr. Khamenei that said he supported ending the war with Israel, according to two Iranians affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p><p>The messages also assured Hezbollah that Iran would continue its support and help the group rebuild its forces and recover from the war, they said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Dahiya area south of Beirut has been hit by a string of bombings this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The Iranians, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the supreme leader had also told Hezbollah to accept the terms of a cease-fire deal demanding it move its forces north, in accordance with U.N.
