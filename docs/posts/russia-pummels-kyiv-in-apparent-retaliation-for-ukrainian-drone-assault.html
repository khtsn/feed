The thuds of air-defense batteries and the staccato bursts of heavy machine guns echoed through the night in the Ukrainian capital as military units defending the city tried to take down missiles streaking overhead and attack drones that swooped in, their ominous buzz trailing over neighborhoods.</p><p>Over the course of some five hours after midnight, Russia launched 407 drones and decoys, nearly 40 cruise missiles and six ballistic missiles from land, air and sea at towns and cities across the breadth of the nation, the Ukrainian Air Force said in <a href="https://t.me/kpszsu/35833" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>. It appeared to be the second-largest drone assault of the war, after Russia launched nearly 500 drones last weekend.</p><p>“Russia doesn’t change its stripes — another massive strike on cities and ordinary life,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/14511" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>. “They targeted almost all of Ukraine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said in <a href="https://t.me/mod_russia/53489" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> that the attack was “in response to terrorist acts” by Ukraine, in an apparent reference to its strikes on the Russian bomber bases last weekend. On Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told President Trump that Russia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/world/europe/putin-zelensky-accusations-escalation.html" title="">would retaliate for these strikes</a>, Mr. Trump said, further dimming hopes for a cease-fire that were already faint.</p><p>The Ukrainian attack, which involved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks.html" title="">smuggling drones deep into the Russian heartland and launching them from semi trucks</a>, destroyed or damaged at least a dozen aircraft, including many of Moscow’s nuclear-capable strategic bombers.</p><p>“They attacked pretty harshly,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWRbK-Ewn90" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump said on Thursday</a> about the Ukrainian assault. “They went deep into Russia.”</p><p>Combined with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-offensive.html" title="">renewed ground offensive in the east</a>, Friday’s attack was part of an intensifying Russian campaign to bombard Ukrainian cities with swarms of drones and missiles to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Overall, Russia has launched more than 1,000 drones per week at military and civilian targets in Ukraine in recent months, the Ukrainian authorities have said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People in uniforms on a street." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp/06ukraine-attack-0b-vmkp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ccb1a4d0-1e2e-5dec-820a-cd63fe90839c" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers collecting what they said were presumably parts from a drone near where a residential building was damaged in a Russian strike in Kyiv on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roman Pilipey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trump compared Russia and Ukraine to two fighting children who needed to work out their differences before their war could end.</p><p>“Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office as Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, urged him to leverage the power of the United States to end the conflict.</p><p>Mr. Trump avoided answering a question about whether he was willing to increase pressure on Russia. The Kremlin has repeatedly resisted his calls for an unconditional cease-fire.</p><p>In Friday’s strike by Russia, Ukrainian fighter jets, antiaircraft missile troops, electronic warfare and unmanned systems units, and mobile fire groups took out 406 of the 452 air attack vehicles, with strikes reported in 13 locations, according to the air force. These figures could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Multiple fires were reported across Kyiv, including at a 16-story apartment block. Another fire near the city center covered an area of more than 5,000 square feet.</p><p>Three people died in Kyiv, all of them rescuers who had rushed to extinguish the fires, the <a href="https://t.me/Klymenko_MVS/1466" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian authorities said</a>. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, also <a href="https://t.me/vitaliy_klitschko/4756" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that 20 people had been injured</a> in the capital. Mr. Klitschko initially said Friday morning that four people had been killed in Kyiv, but later revised the toll to three.</p><p>Parts of western Ukraine that have not come under frequent attack were also targeted.</p><p>The city of Ternopil, which is hundreds of miles from the front, came under heavy assault, the local authorities <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43844" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, with at least 11 people injured, including six emergency workers.</p><p>In Lutsk, in northwestern Ukraine, Russia struck a high-rise apartment building and other locations, killing one person and injuring at least 27 more, <a href="https://t.me/dsns_telegram/43858" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian emergency services said</a>.</p><p>The Russian military said it had struck various military targets on Friday, though this could not be independently verified.

The governor of the Russian Saratov region, Roman Busargin, said that overnight on Thursday, there was a large fire after an oil depot at the Engels air base came under attack by Ukrainian drones.</p><p>“There are no casualties as of yet,” he said.</p><p>A powerful explosion was reported by an airfield in the Bryansk region and the local governor, Alexander Bogomaz, said that some 46 Ukrainian had drones targeted the area.
