She was transferred to a patrol station in Yuma, Ariz., the statement said.</p><p>Ms. Jayapal, a ranking member of the <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/committee-judiciary-118th-congress/immigration-integrity-security-and-enforcement" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">House subcommittee</a> overseeing immigration, said initial reports from the agency had raised concerns about whether officers had properly conducted welfare checks on the woman. While welfare checks were logged, officials at the agency investigating the death could not verify whether the checks had actually happened, Ms. Jayapal said.</p><p>“There is no excuse for why agents cannot verify if some of the necessary welfare checks occurred — or why some of the documented welfare checks were incorrectly reported,” Ms. Jayapal said, adding that she was concerned about the conditions in facilities where immigrants are detained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Another preventable death only increases that concern,” she said.</p><p>The woman had been in the country on a B-1/B-2 visa, according to the statement, <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html/visa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a temporary visa</a> for people visiting the United States for tourism or business.</p><p>The Customs and Border Protection agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the agency confirmed the death of a 52-year-old woman to <a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040325_yuma_bp_death/chinese-woman-commits-suicide-az-border-patrol-station-bp-failed-conduct-welfare-checks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Tucson Sentinel</a>, and said that the woman had become “unresponsive in a cell” at the Yuma Border Patrol Station.</p><p>Border Patrol staff provided medical assistance to the woman, the spokesman said in a statement to The Sentinel, and emergency medical services transported her to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. An office overseeing the agency’s conduct was investigating the incident, the statement said, and the agency also reported the death to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General.</p><p>The exact circumstances around the woman’s initial detainment were not immediately clear. Border Patrol officials for the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/yuma-sector-arizona" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yuma sector</a>, which includes parts of California and Arizona, said last week <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1FKLnsiME9/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that they had arrested two Chinese people, one of them a 52-year-old woman, in Needles, Calif., on March 26.</p><p>According to the post, agents searched a minivan during a vehicle stop and discovered that two Chinese nationals were “illegally present in the U.S.” The agency had planned to charge the two people under a <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1182&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">law</a> that makes certain people ineligible to receive a visa or enter the country, including on the grounds of suspected money laundering or other criminal activity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>More than $220,000 in cash was also seized from the van, and the agency said it believed the cash was linked to illegal activity. But it was not immediately clear on Friday whether the woman arrested in Needles was the same woman who died while in custody.</p><p>Christine Hauser<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Man Deported in Error:</strong> Lawyers for a Maryland man who was deported to El Salvador despite an order that he could remain in the United States, urged the judge overseeing his case to force the Trump administration to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/maryland-man-deported-el-salvador-trump-criticism.html">bring him back as soon as possible</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservative Voices Raise Alarm:</strong> As the administration has rushed to carry out deportations as quickly as possible, the unified front in favor of President Trump’s immigration purge is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-immigration-joe-rogan-conservatives.html">beginning to crack</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nobel Laureate’s Visa Revoked: </strong>Óscar Arias Sánchez, twice president of Costa Rica, has been a vocal critic of Trump.
