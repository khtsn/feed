    <h1>Chinese Woman Detained in Arizona Border Station Dies by Suicide</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Another preventable death only increases that concern,” she said.</p><p>The woman had been in the country on a B-1/B-2 visa, according to the statement, <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html/visa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a temporary visa</a> for people visiting the United States for tourism or business.</p><p>The Customs and Border Protection agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the agency confirmed the death of a 52-year-old woman to <a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040325_yuma_bp_death/chinese-woman-commits-suicide-az-border-patrol-station-bp-failed-conduct-welfare-checks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Tucson Sentinel</a>, and said that the woman had become “unresponsive in a cell” at the Yuma Border Patrol Station.</p><p>Border Patrol staff provided medical assistance to the woman, the spokesman said in a statement to The Sentinel, and emergency medical services transported her to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. An office overseeing the agency’s conduct was investigating the incident, the statement said, and the agency also reported the death to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General.</p><p>The exact circumstances around the woman’s initial detainment were not immediately clear. Border Patrol officials for the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/yuma-sector-arizona" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yuma sector</a>, which includes parts of California and Arizona, said last week <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1FKLnsiME9/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> that they had arrested two Chinese people, one of them a 52-year-old woman, in Needles, Calif., on March 26.</p><p>According to the post, agents searched a minivan during a vehicle stop and discovered that two Chinese nationals were “illegally present in the U.S.” The agency had planned to charge the two people under a <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1182&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">law</a> that makes certain people ineligible to receive a visa or enter the country, including on the grounds of suspected money laundering or other criminal activity.</p></div></div>
