More than 350,000 people across the path of the storm were without power on Monday morning, from Missouri to Virginia, according to the utility tracking website <a href="https://poweroutage.us/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poweroutage.us</a>.</p><p>The storm was moving east from the Midwest, where Kansas and Missouri were particularly hard hit. The National Weather Service in Kansas City <a href="https://x.com/NWSKansasCity/status/1876146445272899792" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on social media that Kansas City International Airport had received 11 inches of snow on Sunday, the fourth-largest single-day total in the city’s recorded history. In Topeka, the Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/NWSTopeka/status/1876081707310579729" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> late Sunday it expected a final total of 14.1 inches, the third-highest single-day snowfall recorded in the area.</p><p>In the Kansas City metropolitan area, residents hunkered indoors amid ice- and snow-covered driveways, and roads deemed too treacherous for travel. Some areas experienced lightning and booming thunder along with wind gusts of up to 35 miles an hour as the storm moved across the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is a rare blizzard for Kansas City,” Gary Lezak, a longtime meteorologist in the area, said on Sunday. “It is insanely cold.”</p><p>The storm caused numerous crashes over the weekend. West of Salina, Kan., a fire truck, multiple tractor-trailers, and passenger vehicles overturned. Several trucks went spiraling into ditches as icy roads became impassable, and pileups snarled interstates across the Midwest region. Missouri Highway Patrol <a href="https://x.com/MSHPTrooperGHQ/status/1875902530024284405" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported more than 150 storm-related crashes</a> in the state as of Sunday evening, including at least one fatal accident that killed a 61-year-old man.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="snow-probabilities-embed" data-id="100000008681088" data-source-id="100000008681088"><div slug="snow-probabilities-embed" data-sourceid="100000008681088" id="embed-id-100000008681088">
