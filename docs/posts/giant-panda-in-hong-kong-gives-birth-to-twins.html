The cubs are also the first to be born in the city.</p><p>Paulo Pong, the chairman of Ocean Park Corporation, said that the births were “thrilling news” and a rarity, given Ying Ying’s advanced age. (Pandas in captivity can live to around 30, but 14 to 20 is more typical in the wild.)</p><p>Ying Ying and Le Le, her mate at Ocean Park, had earlier drawn attention when they mated naturally in 2020 for the first time after 13 years of trying in captivity. At the time, the amusement park and zoo was closed to visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the months that followed, Ying Ying was sluggish, and her appetite was diminished, raising hopes that she could have been pregnant, but the park later said she was not expecting after all.</p></div></div><div><p>This time, the park kept quiet about its hopes.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ying Ying resting on a rock while zoo visitors take a selfie in a photo from several years back.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jerome Favre/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Ying Ying’s keepers noted at the end of July that she was eating less and sleeping more and that her hormone levels were shifting — all potential signs of pregnancy.</p><p>It is hard to tell when a panda is pregnant. The gestation period is between 72 and 324 days, but ultrasound scans can detect cubs in utero only about two weeks before birth. Her pregnancy was confirmed via ultrasound on Sunday.</p><p>On Thursday, the park threw Ying Ying a birthday party, with frozen treats made by Häagen-Dazs, flavored with bamboo, sweet potato and carrot. Her water broke that night, after the celebration. She was “understandably nervous” as a first-time mother, Ocean Park said, and spent much of the next five hours twisting and turning on the ground in labor pains. At 2:05 a.m. and 3:27 a.m., she gave birth to a female and male cub, weighing 4.3 ounces and 4 ounces — within the normal range for newborn pandas.</p><p>The twins are currently under 24-hour intensive care by Ocean Park, with the support of experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. “Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilize, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth,” the park said.</p></div></div><div><p>Baby names are yet to be announced.</p></div><div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany May is a reporter based in Hong Kong, covering the politics, business and culture of the city and the broader region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tiffany-may">More about Tiffany May</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Honoring African Soldiers: </strong>Two months after D-Day, an Allied force dominated by soldiers conscripted from French colonies swept into southern France. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/france-african-soldiers-world-war-ii.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">It’s a chapter of its history that France has long obscured</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Afghanistan’s Anniversary of the Taliban Takeover: </strong>Celebrations marking the third year since the U.S. withdrawal and the Taliban’s return to power are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-anniversary.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">amplifying a divide in Afghanistan</a> over what principles it should be governed by.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brazil’s Maid Rooms: </strong>The tiny rooms, a vestige of the country’s history of slavery, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/americas/brazil-maid-rooms-racist-past.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">disappearing or being transformed</a> as Brazil confronts deeply ingrained inequities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Living in China’s Military Shadow: </strong>More than 200 Filipino civilian settlers on a contested island in the South China Sea find themselves on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/asia/spratlys-thitu-philippines-china.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">the frontier of a possible conflict with China</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What to Do With a Nazi Villa: </strong>Owned by the State of Berlin, the former estate of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/europe/joseph-goebbels-germany-nazi-house.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">too expensive to keep and perilous to sell</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
