    <h1>In Poland’s Presidential Election Runoff, Candidates Battle for Young Voters Who Don’t Like Them</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>A tight presidential election this weekend in Poland hinges heavily on young voters, a restive demographic with a big stake in the direction of the country.</p><p>But the two candidates facing off in a runoff election on Sunday share a big problem: Young Poles do not much like either of them.</p><p>That is adding to the unpredictability of an election widely seen as pivotal for the future of the biggest economic and military power in the European Union’s formerly communist East. It is also critical to efforts by the country’s centrist prime minister, Donald Tusk, to unravel the legacy of his populist predecessor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In a first round of voting on May 18, voters aged 18 to 29 overwhelmingly supported anti-establishment candidates who failed to make it to the runoff. They mostly shunned the candidates competing on Sunday, who represent Poland’s two dominant political parties — Civic Platform, led by Mr. Tusk; and Law and Justice, the former governing party led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/31/multimedia/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/31/multimedia/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/31/multimedia/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People at voting booths." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/31/multimedia/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/31/multimedia/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/31/multimedia/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/31/multimedia/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj/31int-poland-election-youth-01-qwbj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/918a63e8-efcf-542c-97e9-a8dcb18dfcf3" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voting in Warsaw during the first round of the election, held on May 18.

Whether Mr. Trzaskowski can prevail on Sunday depends heavily on how young voters who backed the far right and leftists in the first round, cast their ballots.</p><p>A widespread plague-on-both-your-houses feeling among younger Poles has brought unusual volatility to politics, said Tomasz Slupik, a political science professor at the University of Silesia. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Only 22 percent of voters under 30, according to exit poll data, cast their ballots in the first round for the two candidates competing on Sunday. Nearly 70 percent voted instead for far-right candidates and fringe leftists, with more than half of them supporting Slawomir Mentzen, a libertarian who is hostile to Ukrainian refugees, taxes and the European Union.</p><p>“This might be the beginning of the end of Poland’s party duopoly,” Dr. Slupik said. Young voters’ disillusionment, he added, was partly the rebellious spirit of youth amplified by social media. But, he added, it also reflected a deeper erosion of trust across generations, despite Poland’s booming economy and its emergence as a diplomatic and military player in Europe.</p><p>The Polish presidency has no say in setting policy, but its veto power over legislation passed by the government allowed the departing president, Andrzej Duda, an ally of Mr. Kaczynski, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/world/europe/poland-law-justice-us-trump.html" title="">thwart much of Mr. Tusk’s agenda</a>.</p><p>Victory for Mr. Nawrocki on Sunday would probably mean more trench warfare between the rival camps, hobbling Mr. Tusk’s ability to govern and clouding his party’s prospects in the next parliamentary election in 2027.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Karol Nawrocki at a campaign rally in Warsaw on May 25.

This cannot be!” he said.</p><p>Many younger voters, on both left and right have tuned out.</p><p>The disenchantment of younger Poles was particularly evident in mock elections held last month in high schools as part of a <a href="https://angazuj.ceo.org.pl/programy-edukacyjne/mlodzi-glosuja/wybory-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national project to assess the political leanings</a> of those still too young to vote.</p><p>Finishing first at Leon Kruczkowski High School in Tychy was Adrian Zandberg, a leftist who came in sixth in the first round of the real election.</p><p>Mr. Mentzen also did well, winning nearly 13 percent of Tychy’s high school vote. His biggest young fans are teenage boys like Oliwier Milon, 16, who said he supported the far-right politician’s desire for Poland to leave the European Union and expel Ukrainian refugees.</p><p>“They feel too much at ease here and take our money,” he said of Ukrainians, sitting with five friends, all Mentzen supporters, at an outdoor market in Tychy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>One of his friends, Fabian Popielecki, 15, chipped in that he supported Mr. Mentzen’s criticism of L.G.B.T. rights. “We don’t tolerate such things here,” he said.</p><p>All agreed that they saw nothing to like in either Civic Platform or Law and Justice. “They are for old people,” Mr. Milon said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mentzen, the far-right candidate, did not make the runoff, and it is uncertain which of the two remaining presidential hopefuls his supporters will back.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kasia Strek/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“Youth is all about being extreme,” said Bozena Tomaka-Olszanska, a high school history teacher who coordinated a mock student election in the nearby town of Gliwice. “Young people are clearly fed up with the two-element system of power.”</p><p>Many of those old enough to vote are also unhappy with established parties and their veteran leaders. Anna Liebner, 29, a Tychy resident who manages fiber optic networks, said she voted in the first round for Mr. Zandberg, the leftist, because he “was out of the system” and had put forward policies she liked, like higher taxes on the wealthy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Kamil Poczta, 30, an I.T. worker, said he, too, had voted for Mr. Zandberg in the hope of breaking the Civic Platform-Law and Justice cycle.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr. Poczta and Ms. Liebner both said they would vote for Mr. Trzaskowski.</p><p>More uncertain is which way Mr. Mentzen’s voters, mostly young men, will jump, though a recent opinion poll indicated that around 65 percent of them would vote for Mr. Nawrocki.</p><p>If that turns out to be accurate, Mr. Nawrocki could well win.</p><p>The turn away from established parties by Poland’s young has exasperated their elders.</p><p>Stanislaw Brejdygant, 88, an actor and playwright who experienced both Nazi and Soviet occupations of Poland, last week begged young voters “to come to their senses” and vote for Mr. Trzaskowski in an impassioned <a href="https://wyborcza.pl/7,162657,31951035,chyba-to-juz-moja-ostatnia-refleksja-o-nieszczesnym-narodzie.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion essay</a> in a liberal Warsaw newspaper.</p><p>“I appreciate and admire your rebellion,” he said. “But believe me,” he added in an appeal to Mr. Mentzen’s voters, “it is one thing to rebel in a democratic, free country, in which you live now, and quite another in the one that your idol wants to give you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Electoral posters on the streets of Warsaw in early May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Wojtek Radwanski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Anatol Magdziarz<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
