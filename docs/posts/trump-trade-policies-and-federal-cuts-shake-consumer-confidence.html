    <h1>Trump Trade Policies and Federal Cuts Shake Consumer Confidence</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Americans are increasingly anxious about their jobs and finances as the Trump administration’s trade policies and government cutbacks stoke concern about the economy.</p><p><a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer confidence tumbled</a> this month to its lowest level since January 2021, the Conference Board reported on Tuesday, extending a decline that has been underway since shortly after President Trump was elected last fall. The short-term outlook for “income, business and labor market conditions” fell to its lowest reading in 12 years, the business group reported, signaling consumer angst about a deterioration in economic conditions in the coming year.</p><p>Economists have warned that Mr. Trump’s plans for sweeping tariffs on the United States’ biggest trading partners could reignite inflation. Whiplash from shifting trade policies, and investors’ concern about a potential slowdown in the American economy, fueled a stock-market <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/sp-500-stocks-market-correction.html" title="">sell-off</a> earlier this month. Households are bracing for higher inflation over the next year, according to the survey, with 12-month inflation expectations rising to 6.2 percent, from an outlook of 5.8 percent in February. (Over the most recent 12 months, the inflation rate was 2.8 percent, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/business/economy/inflation-cpi-february-economy.html" title="">Consumer Price Index for February</a>.)</p><p>Consumers are “spooked” by the Trump administration’s trade wars, cuts to the federal government by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and the recent stock market sell-off, said Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank.</p></div></div>
