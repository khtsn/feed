One big hope is that deal making is set to boom, and that’s driving a rebound in bank stocks.</p><p><strong>But alarm bells are ringing, even inside the banks. </strong>Some Wall Street economists continue to warn that Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs and tax cuts will reignite inflation and add to the deficit. And even as his allies say <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/markets-hail-trumps-economics-he-will-repair-biden-damage-pro-growth-investment-boost-f3954dbe?mod=opinion_elections4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the market rally shows</a> that the traditional experts are wrong, don’t be surprised if the president-elect finds that tighter economic conditions and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/business/dealbook/trump-economy-bonds.html" title="">restive bond market</a> force a rethink of his agenda.</p><p>“This is not 2016, when Trump inherited an economy recovering from six years of secular stagnation,” Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, wrote in a client note on Monday. She notes that the bond investors are worried about higher inflation and debt-financing costs — thanks in part to a $35 trillion debt pile — which could constrain a new administration.</p><p>Shalett added that, “these dynamics have introduced uncertainties around Fed easing, rising yields” and dollar strength.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>The bulls see it very differently. </strong>Consider these moves:</p><ul><li><p>Bitcoin was trading near $90,000 on Tuesday, having doubled since the start of the year. MicroStrategy said that it bought more than $2 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, adding to its huge holdings and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/microstrategy-buys-2-03-billion-of-bitcoin-in-latest-purchase?srnd=phx-deals&amp;sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushing its stock to a record</a>.</p></li><li><p>Tesla has climbed more than 40 percent in the past week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/tesla-tsla-devotees-go-all-in-driving-300-billion-rally-on-trump-win?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">adding more than $300 billion to its market value</a>, and is up again in premarket trading.</p></li><li><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks shares of some of the nation’s largest lenders, is on one of its best runs in years — and analysts think <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rallying-bank-stocks-have-further-room-to-run-analyst-says-310f1136" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more gains are to come</a>. (The soaring stock market is expected to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wall-street-bonuses-will-rise-first-time-since-2021-consultant-says-2024-11-12/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boost Wall Street bonuses</a> this year.)</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>The dollar and Treasuries tell a different story.</strong> The greenback <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-rises-highest-since-july-024503941.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been climbing</a> since Trump’s victory, a potential drag on multinationals’ profits. Elsewhere, the yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury bill ticked higher again on Tuesday, suggesting that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/68978a40-226e-43f5-b56a-bbc5896f578b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investors are on alert</a> about inflation and the Fed.</p><p><strong>That could prompt the central bank to turn more hawkish.</strong> The futures market on Tuesday was pricing in three rate cuts by the end of 2025 that would bring the benchmark lending rate to 3.8 percent, far higher than it foresaw just six weeks ago.</p><p><strong>Up next: </strong> Tomorrow’s Consumer Price Index report is forecast to show that recent months of easing inflation <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/economy/forecasts-october-cpi-report-show-inflation-progress-stalling-now" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may have stalled</a>.</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>SoftBank’s earnings jump after big paper gains at its Vision Fund unit.</strong> Masa Son’s tech investment giant reported its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/softbank-swings-to-profit-with-help-from-hot-indian-ipo-market" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">biggest quarterly profit</a> in two years after its first Vision Fund benefited from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/softbank-earnings-q2-2024.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rising valuations</a> for several portfolio companies. It’s good news for Son, who has sought to lead another turnaround at SoftBank, though it’s unclear whether the earnings jump is enough to assuage the activist investor Elliott Management.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Dish Network bondholders suggest that they will oppose a sale to DirecTV.</strong> Leaders of a group of Dish creditors wrote in a letter on Monday, reviewed by DealBook, that the proposed deal would provide a windfall to Charlie Ergen, Dish’s chair, while forcing them to take a haircut on their holdings. Tuesday is the deadline for bondholders to tender their holdings.</p><p><strong>A top Israeli official suggests that “the time has come” to annex the West Bank.</strong> Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister, said on Monday that Donald Trump’s win could give Israel an opportunity to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/11/middleeast/israeli-minister-annexation-occupied-west-bank-intl/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extend its sovereignty</a> over the territory. It’s unclear whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would undertake that step. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia accused Israel of committing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8x5570514o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“genocide” in Gaza</a>, some of the kingdom’s toughest public criticism of the country. Israel has consistently denied the accusation.</p><h2 id="link-1137be88">Musk versus the Republican establishment</h2><p>Elon Musk’s influence has climbed to new heights after he helped Donald Trump retake the presidency. And the tech billionaire hasn’t been shy about using his sway, particularly on his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/technology/elon-musk-trump-x.html" title="">social network, X</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But establishment Republicans appear to be testing the limits of Musk’s influence in a high-profile contest: who will become the next Senate majority leader.</p><p><strong>“Rick Scott for Senate Majority Leader!”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855702328571253103" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Musk wrote</a> to his more than 200 million followers on X on Sunday, becoming perhaps the most powerful Trump ally to endorse the Florida Republican for the chamber’s top position. Others backing Scott include Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, and Charlie Kirk, a conservative influencer.</p><p>Musk has also spoken out against Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, who has drawn the opposition of the hard right. “(Republican) Senator Thune is the top choice of Democrats 🤣🤣,” Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855686929553207425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. The other major candidate is Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who has also been criticized by the MAGA right.</p><p><strong>But Senate Republicans appear unlikely to listen.</strong> They’re set to vote on Wednesday, and all indications suggest that Scott won’t win. Senators will vote via secret ballot — meaning that they are at least somewhat insulated from public pressure — and Axios reports that many lawmakers <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/11/rick-scott-senate-republican-leader-maga-trump" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resent the campaign for Scott</a>. The Florida Republican isn’t popular among his colleagues, having won just 10 votes when he last sought to lead the Senate G.O.P. caucus.</p><p>Trump himself, who hasn’t weighed in, appears to recognize that Scott won’t win. The Times reports that the president-elect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-senate-thune-scott.html" title="">probably won’t speak out</a> on the contest unless someone was likely to prevail.

It isn’t clear which initiatives are on the chopping block.</p><p>That said, House Democrats are reportedly discussing ways to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/11/house-democrats-trump-lame-duck" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blunt Trump’s efforts</a> while they still control the chamber.</p><p><strong>In other Trump news:</strong> Trump may have to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/11/trump-government-shutdown-deadline/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">face a government shutdown</a> in March as Congress appears poised to adopt another temporary federal funding bill.
