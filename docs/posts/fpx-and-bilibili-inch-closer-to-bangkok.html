<p>Titan — who finished league play in 2024 dead last — were the exact opposite of FunPlus Phoenix, a squad who only missed out on the top spot last year due to tiebreakers. They came into the new year swinging, though, picking two maps off of <span data-ref-id="4">

FPX, meanwhile, debuted their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/417974/funplus-phoenix-signs-yosemite-york-as-assistant-coach" target="_blank">offseason pick</a> <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/6022/yosemite">

</span> in this match.</p>

<p>He shined in Titan&#39;s map pick of Abyss, the most contested of the match. Abyss was defined by a series of momentum swings, as each team chained its own sequence of rounds. FPX were the first to reach double digits and even climbed to 11 points, but Titan replied with five of their own to take map one 13-11.</p>

<p>Tejo debuted in China in the second map, Fracture, as Titan&#39;s <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/488/rb">
		Rb	</a>
</span> paired it with Breach and Neon for a massive frontline. FPX used a new, but fairly standard, double-smoker composition that charged <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/872/autumn">
		Autumn	</a>
</span>&#39;s Vyse with keeping the backlines in check.</p>

<p>Titan actually started out ahead in the first few rounds, but FPX&#39;s two smokers quickly annulled that ambitious frontline. By halftime, FPX were 7-5 up and, a few rounds later, they had clinched the map altogether 13-7, largely thanks to a four-round streak that opened up their attack.</p>

<p>Decider Pearl had FPX written all over it. Autumn &amp; co. spread themselves over seven consecutive rounds to find an attacking-side lead, and any hopes Titan had of recovering seemed crushed when <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/19530/aaaay">
		AAAAY	</a>
</span> closed out the half with a 1v4 on B.</p>


<p><em>Plain and simple outplayed.</em></p>

<p>The rest of the map was smooth sailing from thereon for FPX, who won it 13-6. <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3028/life">
		Life	</a>
</span>, AAAAY, and Autumn were instrumental in taking the final map. AAAAY&#39;s +10 kill differential was the second-best of the match, bested only by <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/30526/b1ack">
		B1ack	</a>
</span>&#39;s +12 on Abyss.</p>

<p>FPX&#39;s 2-1 victory puts them in the upper semifinals. Should they win those, the team will still need a second win if they are to secure a spot in Thailand and return to LAN play in Bangkok.</p>



<p>Xi Lai kicked off the year with a bang, taking a tight <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430837/xi-lai-gaming-vs-wolves-esports-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-ur1" target="_blank">2-0 win</a> over <span data-ref-id="11">

</span>. While the wolves had a rough end to 2024, Xi Lai were about to face former international reps BLG, a seasoned LAN team who had a relatively calm offseason. In October, Bilibili dismissed <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4705/flex1n">
		Flex1n	</a>
</span> and yosemite in favor of promoting <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/418068/bilibili-gaming-signs-rushia" target="_blank">academy prospect</a> <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/48878/rushia">
		rushia	</a>
</span> to round out their 2025 roster.</p>

<p>The match kicked off on Haven, Xi Lai&#39;s pick. The Ascension débutantes came out in full force, but only found a solid advantage after a stellar ace from <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/37927/happywei">
		happywei	</a>
</span> on a C-site retake. Their 7-5 halftime lead was short-lived, as BLG climbed to 11, but a late surge from Xi Lai&#39;s <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/22047/rarga">
		Rarga	</a>
</span> allowed them to clinch a 13-11 opening win.</p>

<p>Lotus was almost a mirror image of Haven, with a close first half followed by a dominating streak in the closing stages of the game. BLG got to map point first, but Xi Lai delayed a match tie with three lightning-quick rounds. In the final round of regulation, a strong B hold allowed Bilibili to tie up the match and trigger the decider.</p>

<p>Abyss was the final map left, in what would be BLG&#39;s VCT debut on the map. Xi Lai never shied away from the map since it entered the pool last year, but have a generally shaky record on it. Coming into this decider, neither team had played Abyss in the new year.</p>

<p>An extremely close decider was the perfect conclusion to an equally tight match, once again defined by momentum swings. Xi Lai&#39;s 8-4 halftime lead was the largest gap between the two teams in the entire match, but BLG quickly worked on closing that. Xi Lai dotted their defense with just three rounds, enabling Bilibili to complete the comeback with a 13-11 victory that pushed them into the semifinals.</p>

<p>Bilibili&#39;s opening win at Kickoff puts them in the upper semifinals against FunPlus Phoenix, a bout BLG haven&#39;t won since July 2023. A win in that match means they will be just one away from securing a spot in Bangkok.</p>


<p><em>That last bullet feels illegal.</em></p>

<p>Today was the first of 10 straight days of competition on the path to determine China&#39;s two Masters Bangkok representatives. Only two teams from the region will make it, the first of which still needs to win at least two more matches to reach the grand final and claim the coveted LAN slot.</p>
