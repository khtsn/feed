She was 93. </p><p>Her death was confirmed on Thursday by Angela Mariani, the communications consultant for Missoni.</p><p>What began in 1953 as a homespun venture for the Missonis was transformed in just a couple of decades into a leading fashion house with one of the world’s most recognizable brands.</p><p>If Emilio Pucci’s bold swirls helped define Italian fashion in the 1950s and ’60s, Missoni’s squiggly, striped and multicolored space-dyed designs marked the ’70s. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/obituaries/bernadine-morris-veteran-observer-of-fashion-dies-at-92.html" title="">Bernadine Morris</a>, a fashion critic for The New York Times, called the label’s knitted garments international status symbols, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/26/archives/missonis-clothes-a-hit-as-milan-showings-open-engulfed-in-fashion.html" title="">writing in 1979</a> that the Missonis “have elevated knitted clothes to a form of art.”</p><p>At first, the Missonis sold their sweaters anonymously or under co-labels with known designers, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/fashion/emmanuelle-khanh-french-fashion-designer-dies.html" title="">Emmanuelle Khanh</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3108992/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christiane Bailly</a>. Rosita eventually took over the design of the silhouettes, and Ottavio handled the patterns: space dyes, stripes, squiggles, chevrons, all in vivid colors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Five years after the company’s founding, Missoni dresses could be purchased at <a href="https://www.rinascente.it/en/store-milano" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">La Rinascente</a>, the upscale department store in Milan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/fashion/anna-piaggi-italian-fashion-editor-dies-at-81.html" title="">Anna Piaggi</a>, the editor of Vogue Italia, had Missoni designs photographed for an editorial shoot published in 1965. The family business had become a high-fashion brand.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A model posing in a Missoni outfit on pillows covered in Missoni fabric.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Missoni’s first runway shows were held in Milan in 1966. A semiannual fashion week had taken place there since 1958, but Florence and Rome were still the premier locations for “alta moda” presentations.</p><p>The Missonis showed their ready-to-wear collections in <a href="http://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/11178/the-1960s-missoni-shows-that-turned-the-worlds-attention-to-milan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imaginative environments</a> in Milan, first at a historic theater, Teatro Gerolamo, with the assistance of the spatial artist <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/lucio-fontana" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lucio Fontana</a>, and then at a well-known public swimming pool, Piscina Solari, where models floated on inflatable furniture designed by Quasar Khanh. Missoni shows — part-collection, part-performance art — were a precursor to the Instagrammable runway spectacles of the 2010s and over time made Milan a destination for fashion critics from around the world.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mrs. Missoni and her husband, Ottavio, appeared during a fashion show in October 1996 to introduce their 1997 Spring-Summer collection. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Enzo Signorelli/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The couple showed their next collection in Florence, at the Palazzo Pitti. Backstage, when Mrs. Missoni saw her models in the thin knit dresses that she and her husband had conceived, she asked them to remove their bras, which were showing through the fabric. What she hadn’t considered was how the stage lights would affect the transparency of the garments; the scandalous see-through dresses became the talk of the town, and the Missonis were not asked to show in Florence again.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>So they returned to showing in Milan. Missoni’s presence on the calendar drew other Northern Italian knitwear brands, whose factories had been renovated in the 1950s with money from the Marshall Plan.</p><p>By then the Missonis had captivated the American fashion press. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/23/obituaries/diana-vreeland-editor-dies-voice-of-fashion-for-decades.html" title="">Diana Vreeland</a>, the editor of Vogue, featured Missoni in a 1969 spread — a major endorsement for the company and proof that colorful sweaters could be as viable an art form as couture gowns.</p><p>Later that year, the couple built a factory in Sumirago, in view of the Italian Alps. The architect Enrico Buzzi designed the factory and built for the Missonis a relatively modest stucco house nearby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Missoni manufacturing plant in Sumirago, Northern Italy, in 1975.

Like her grandparents before them, her parents, Diamante and Angelo Jelmini, worked in the family factory, where Rosita spent much of her youth absorbing techniques and aesthetics, including the colorful zigzags that would become a Missoni signature.</p><p>“There among the fabric and the patterns, I learned all about ’30s fashion, cutting it out in silhouettes,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/t-magazine/rosita-missoni-garden-home.html" title="">she told T</a>: The New York Times Style Magazine in 2017. The first sweater she designed was made using material from the factory.</p><p>Rosita, who grew up with two brothers, Alberto and Giampiero, was a sickly child. Her parents sent her away to school on the Ligurian coast, hoping the change of scenery would improve her health. Living on a Mediterranean diet near the sea and engaging with the school’s “marvelous garden” seemed to help.</p><p>Rosita met Ottavio, known to his friends as Tai, in 1948. She was a student in London studying English, and he was a hurdler with the Italian track and field team competing in the Summer Olympics there. They first saw each other near the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus. At the top of the fountain is a statue of Anteros, the god of requited love.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Missonis in 2009.

Ottavio had graduated from athlete to designer, fashioning uniforms for the Italian team ahead of the 1952 Olympics.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/fashion/ottavio-missoni-is-dead-at-92.html" title="">Mr. Missoni died</a> at 92 in May 2013, just a few months after their son Vittorio was killed in a plane crash. Mrs. Missoni is survived by her two other children, as well as her brother Alberto, nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.</p><p><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/tastemakers-designer-margherita-missoni.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Margherita Missoni</a>, Angela’s daughter, was named the creative director of M Missoni, the lower-price Missoni label, in 2018, introducing a new generation of family leadership. That same year, the family sold a 41.2 percent stake in the company but retained control.</p><p>In her later years, Mrs. Missoni continued to oversee the Missoni Home line as creative director. She was known to wear her hair in a ducktail braid fastened with a Missoni ribbon. She continued to entertain at her home near the Missoni factory well into her 80s.</p><p>“We are very happy here,” Mrs. Missoni told The Times in 1974, interviewed at the home. “Our family and our business have grown together. We enjoy watching the seasons change. Even in winter, we often put on heavy sweaters and eat out on the terrace in the sun. It is exactly the kind of life we want for ourselves. Very casual.”</p><p>Ash Wu<!-- --> and <!-- -->Penn Bullock<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
