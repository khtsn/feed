Policymakers, she suggested, should not try to slow the economy down if evidence suggests that price increases are coming under control.</p><p>“I’m very opposed to cutting off expansion out of fear,” Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said during an interview on Tuesday morning, ahead of a speech she delivered at New York University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She pointed out that back in 2019, in the year leading up to the pandemic, the job market was very strong but that it did not lead to rapid inflation. In that experience, low unemployment allowed for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/black-unemployment-wages.html" title="">solid wage gains</a>, and it pulled new people into the labor market.</p><p>“We should not kill off job growth and good growth as long as it doesn’t produce inflation,” she said. “If we could get 2019 again, I’d be all for it — why not?”</p><p>That is not to say the Fed is bent on doing a small rate cut at each of its remaining meetings this year no matter what happens. If inflation turns out to be more stubborn than expected, the Fed could cut less. If the job market slows, it could cut more.</p><p>If the labor market is “a little bit faster than that, and inflation is a little bit stickier” than expected, then one rate cut might be appropriate, Ms. Daly said. “If, on the other side of that, the labor market decelerates more quickly, or inflation comes down more quickly, well, then we could make additional adjustments.”</p><p>Ms. Daly is one of 19 officials at the Fed, and <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of</a> 12 who vote on monetary policy in 2024. But she is a labor economist, and she was an influential voice at the table in 2019 when the central bank was considering how to calibrate its policy at a moment of solid growth but benign inflation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her comments come at a time when Fed officials are contemplating how much and how quickly to lay off the economic brakes. After raising rates sharply in 2022 and 2023, policymakers cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years at their meeting last month. They also projected that the central bank would continue to gradually lower rates in the coming months.</p><p>Fed officials are trying to make sure that they fully stamp out inflation — which has cooled substantially from its mid-2022 peak and is nearly back to normal. But by slowly dialing back their policy restraint, they hope to avoid cooling the economy so much that they cause the job market to crack painfully.</p><p>Other policymakers have been clear that rate cuts could speed up if the job market slows, or slow down if inflation gets stuck.</p><p>Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said this week</a> that he thought officials could lower rates at a “deliberate pace” if the economy shaped up as expected. If inflation proves sticky, he said, officials “can pause rate cuts until progress resumes and uncertainty diminishes,” but only “as long as the labor market isn’t deteriorating.”</p><p>But Ms. Daly’s comments offered a hint at what would happen if the job market looked strong while inflation kept cooling. In some ways, that seems likely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>September’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/04/business/jobs-report-september-economy" title="">employment report</a> was much stronger than expected, and the October jobs data — set for release just before the next Fed meeting, in early November — is likely to provide only a muddled picture of what has happened recently. Between a strike at Boeing and America’s recent hurricanes, that report could look weak. But officials are likely to shrug off its importance and its signal given those events.</p><p>“I expect these factors may reduce employment growth by more than 100,000 this month,” Mr. Waller said on Monday.</p><p>When it comes to the broader economy, things seem to be holding up. The stock market is tracing new highs, holiday <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/steady-sales-growth-expected-2024-holiday-season-according-nrf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">retail sales</a> are expected to look steady and consumers as a whole still look resilient.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeanna Smialek covers the Federal Reserve and the economy for The Times from Washington.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeanna-smialek">More about Jeanna Smialek</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/federal-reserve-bank-of-san-francisco">Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-reserve-the-fed">Federal Reserve (The Fed)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/mary-c-daly">Mary C.
