Kathy Hochul said in a statement on Saturday that there were multiple wildfires burning across New York State, noting that Hudson Valley, Long Island and the Catskills region were at high risk.</p><p>Ms. Hochul had deployed a “multiagency response” to fires burning across hundreds of acres in Ulster, Sullivan and Orange Counties, the statement said.</p><p>Firefighters in New York City first received a call about the Prospect Park fire at around 6:40 p.m. Friday. It took about three hours and over 100 emergency responders to put out the blaze, a Fire Department spokesman said.</p><p>One firefighter was taken to a nearby hospital for a minor injury. The cause of the blaze has yet to be determined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>While a smoky haze filtered over Brooklyn on Saturday morning, blurring the edges of fall foliage on an otherwise sunny day, New Yorkers tried to make sense of the fire.</p><p>“The buildings aren’t made out of wood, are they?” one woman asked her friend while walking down Nostrand Avenue in the borough’s Crown Heights neighborhood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The fire in Prospect Park burned two acres of a heavily wooded area.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At Grand Army Plaza near Prospect Park, a weekly farmers’ market was in full swing. Ava Butler, 26, was shocked to hear about the fire.</p><p>“I didn’t think it would happen in Prospect Park,” she said, adding, “It’s scary and sad.”</p><p>Mars Charles, who was selling sea moss at the market, was less concerned. He just thought someone was barbecuing, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Lisa Bura woke up coughing in the middle of the night, thinking her apartment was on fire. She saw smoke coming through her open windows, she said.</p><p>“I didn’t turn on the lights, but I could definitely tell that there was a lot of smoke in the air,” she said. “I was thinking about getting some masks, but I haven’t.”</p><p>Around the same time firefighters were battling the blaze in Brooklyn, <a href="https://bronx.news12.com/brush-fire-occurs-in-highbridge-multiple-incidents-reported-this-week" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another brush fire broke out in Highbridge Park</a> in the Bronx. Roughly 25 firefighters took about two and a half hours to extinguish the blaze, the Fire Department said.</p><p>Diana Finch, a resident of the Bronx Park East neighborhood, got a heavy whiff of the smoke, which she said smelled like a wood fire, as it came through her bedroom windows at 4:30 a.m. on Saturday.</p><p>The smell reminded her of another brush fire that occurred in her neighborhood last week.</p><p>Ms. Finch said that people all over the borough were talking about the smoky scent, many connecting it back to wildfires that engulfed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/nyregion/wildfires-drought-new-jersey-connecticut.html" title="">parts of New Jersey and Connecticut</a> this week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A fire broke out in the Greenwood Lake area of New York, near the New Jersey border, at around 11 a.m. on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Anselm for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We are smelling all of it,” said Phyllis Nastasio, another Bronx resident.</p><p>Ms. Nastasio was leaving the restaurant Wicked Wolf on Friday night when the smoke first hit her nostrils. It was very windy and you could immediately smell it when you stepped outside, she noted.</p><p>Another fire broke out in Greenwood Lake, N.Y. — a village in Orange County close to the New Jersey border — at around 11 a.m. on Saturday. Local firefighters were on the scene and battling the blaze, according to an emergency management dispatcher. It was unclear how much the smoke from the fire was contributing to the smell in the city.</p><p>Amid a particularly dry fall, New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/nyregion/drought-watch-nyc-weather.html" title="">drought watch</a> last week, urging residents to conserve water.</p><p>The dry season has contributed to an uptick in brush fires, said Zachary Iscol, the city’s commissioner of emergency management. He and other officials are pushing people to conserve water and remain vigilant, as the region’s drought is expected to continue over the next two months.</p><p>Romaissaa Benzizoune<!-- -->, <!-- -->Julian Roberts-Grmela<!-- --> and <!-- -->Olivia Bensimon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shayla Colon is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/shayla-colon">More about Shayla Colon</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>26</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>After Brush Fires, Smoky Smell Lingers Over New York<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
