Upon entering the party, Mr. Lee, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/movies/spike-lee-denzel-washington-highest-2-lowest-cannes.html" title="">dedicated New York Knicks fan</a>, said he was glad he missed the previous night’s playoff game, in which his team suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Indiana Pacers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I was on another continent, a thousand miles away,” he said. “They cannot blame that disaster on me.”</p><p>Mr. Brody had donated one of his artworks, a mixed media piece centered on Marilyn Monroe, to the night’s auction. He was not the only actor to do so. James Franco, who has recently been less visible following<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/us/james-franco-sexual-misconduct-settlement.html" title=""> sexual misconduct allegations</a>, also supplied a painting. </p><p>Ciara kicked off the dinner with a performance of her hits including “1, 2 Step,” flanked by two backup dancers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Franco</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andreas Rentz/amfAR, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kevin Spacey</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott a Garfitt/Invision, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>And while the night was hosted by Taraji P. Henson, the affair was dominated by the flashy live auction where items included Chopard diamond earrings, an Andy Warhol screenprint, and a Dodge Charger used in “Fast X,” the most recent installment in the “Fast &amp; Furious” franchise, which the movie’s star, Michelle Rodriguez, hyped up with a giggly introduction.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>A George Condo painting, made specially for the occasion, was the big seller at 1,150,000 euros, or about $1.3 million. Mr. Lee contributed a surprise item of a walk-on role in his next movie, and added during the bidding he would take the winner to a Knicks game next season.</p><p>As is now tradition at the gala, the auction featured a fashion show curated by the French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld, with a <a href="https://www.amfar.org/auction/from-cannes-with-love/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collection</a> that immediately sold. This year’s theme was “From Cannes With Love,” a tribute to James Bond. Ms. Hatcher, who played a Bond girl in the 1997 film “Tomorrow Never Dies,” walked the runway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kevin Robert Frost, the chief executive of amfAR.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tristan Fewings/amfAR, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>After a brief intermission in bidding, Mr. Lambert performed a series of songs by Queen with accompaniment from the band’s drummer Roger Taylor.</p><p>But it wasn’t until the end of the long event, well after midnight, that the 1980s pop dandies, Duran Duran, who are about to embark on a European tour, took the stage.</p><p>While guests lit up cigarettes inside, Mr. Domingo, Mariska Hargitay and Georgina Chapman grooved along to songs like “Notorious” and “Ordinary World.”</p><p>But the night, and the world, felt far from ordinary.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
