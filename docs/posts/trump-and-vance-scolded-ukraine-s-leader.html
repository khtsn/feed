The leaders accused Zelensky of not being grateful enough for U.S. support in its war with Russia — “just say thank you,” Vance said — and sought to strong-arm him into a peace deal on whatever terms the Americans dictated.</p><p>“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelensky. “And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out, and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.”</p><p>The shouting match, which was televised, ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-mineral-deal-trump.html" title="">eroded plans for a rare minerals deal</a> between the two countries and cut short a visit meant to coordinate a plan for peace.

He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elon Musk at the White House this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-62498b6f">Musk’s federal takeover began before Trump took office</h2><p>The billionaire Elon Musk knew little about the inner workings of the government when Trump tapped him overhaul the bureaucracy.
