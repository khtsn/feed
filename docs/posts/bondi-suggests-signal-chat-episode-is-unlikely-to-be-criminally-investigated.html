She did not mention the prosecution of Mr. Trump over his handling of classified documents after his first term in office — a case which was ultimately abandoned when he won a second term.</p><p>In this case, Ms. Bondi seemed to be ruling out any similar investigation to determine all the facts.</p><p>Dating back to at least the Reagan administration, the government has considered the details of “military plans, weapons, or operations” to be classified.</p><p>Under federal law, it is possible for people to be charged with crimes for mishandling national defense information that is not classified, but such prosecutions are very rare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This month, hours before the military strikes against Houthi targets, Mr. Hegseth texted the group the plan of attack, including the time at which “the first bombs will definitely drop.”</p><p>After the attack was carried out, the details of the text conversation were revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, who was accidentally included in the conversation among the senior officials.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth and other senior officials have argued that the information he shared was not classified, and that it was ultimately up to his department to decide what of its information should be considered classified.</p><p>National security experts said that argument fails a test of basic common sense about the danger of letting military plans leak before an operation, and that it goes against longtime practice among military and intelligence agencies.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/intelligence-officials-signal-leak.html" title="">sparred over the issue with Trump administration officials</a> at a congressional hearing Wednesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told the House intelligence committee that “no sources, methods, locations or war plans” were shared.</p><p>In the same hearing, Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, scoffed at claims that the information was not classified. “You all know that’s a lie,” he said. “It’s a lie to the country.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the Signal Leak</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Using Semantics to Downplay the Leak:</strong> War plan or battle plan?
