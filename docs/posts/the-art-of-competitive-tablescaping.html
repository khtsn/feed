Maybe some muted tablecloths and tapered candles? These are not those kinds of tables. These are extravagant, excessive and technically precise set pieces that some contestants will spend all year designing and crafting.</p><p>“People think it’s trivial,” said Ava Tramer, a film and television writer who started competing in 2018. “But I take the idea of getting everything right and respecting the sport very seriously.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Ms. Tramer’s first table theme was “Helen’s Birthday Party,” a study of a lonely cat lady whose party guests included her cats Princess Fishbone, Mr. Tinkles and Muffy 2.

And her narrative approach and dedication to handmade elements has since helped her win ribbons.</p><p>The British designer David Hicks coined the term “tablescape” in the 1960s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/30/archives/westchester-opinion-an-interpreter-of-taste-an-interpreter-of-taste.html" title="">describing it as</a> “the discipline of selection.” Amateur table-setting competitions predate the term and they’re fixtures at state and county fairs across the country.</p><p>At the Los Angeles County Fair, where tablescaping is especially popular and over the top, the event has drawn crowds since the 1930s. Though the tables have evolved, a discipline of selection still drives each one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Contestants commit wholeheartedly to an idea and are given four hours to assemble their visions in a frenzy of irons and steamers, snapping tape measures and safety pins, while the scent of Windex and hot glue fill the air.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-22555eba"><span>Tips for your holiday table</span></h3><ul><li><p>Find your theme, commit to it.</p></li><li><p>Pick a color scheme of about two to four colors.</p></li><li><p>Use handmade items whenever possible.</p></li><li><p>No matter the décor, start with straight, even place settings.</p></li><li><p>Use cloth napkins; try a fun napkin fold.</p></li><li><p>Make sure people can see each other over the centerpieces!</p></li><li><p>When your table is finished, sit down at it; take it in from different angles.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ava Tramer got engaged at the fair’s tablescaping competition, mid-styling.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ava Tramer</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Whether a table is holiday-themed and cluttered with glittering stars or crafted to resemble the surface of the moon, with papier-mâché aliens emerging from rocky craters, judges expect it to be set with spotless silverware and glassware. Contestants display their themed menus and though real food is prohibited on competition tables, each setting should anticipate its respective menu.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Tables are 40 by 60 inches and must be set for at least two people. Judging is strict, focusing on creativity, originality, use of color, correctness and presentation.</p><p>Scores are posted publicly for fairgoers to see as they walk around, and contestants often photograph them to study the judges’ notes later on. These can be brief (“inconsistent napkin pattern”), affirming (“love how the references are properly cited”) and occasionally haunting (“a dessert spoon would have been nice.”).</p><p>Ben Dewald, a judge who teaches at the Collins College of Hospitality Management, said he marvels each year at how contestants find new ways to outdo themselves. Based on the previous year’s top tables, microtrends will move through the tablescaping community. “It’s amazing,” he said, “People now decorate even the legs of the tables.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Branden Boyer-White, pictured here, and Shannon Watters built a squid for their “Dinner With Captain Nemo” table.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shannon Watters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He docks points for what might seem like obvious stuff: stained or crooked silverware, a wrinkled or unevenly placed tablecloth, an overachieving centerpiece that blocks the sightline between diners.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But even Mr. Dewald admitted that “correctness” can be debated, and that so much about a great tablescape is harder to quantify. “It’s easy to look and find out what’s not perfect,” he said. “But ‘best in show’ is the hardest thing to pick.”</p><p>Perfection is almost everything — a technically flawless tablescape doesn’t distract you with mistakes — but a truly great tablescape goes beyond that into squishier territory. It makes you feel<em> </em>something. It makes you giggle or gasp. It transmits delight and tells you something — maybe everything — about the person who set it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Table inspiration can come from anywhere, in this case the introduction to “Masterpiece Mystery!”.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shannon Watters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Branden Boyer-White, a writer, grew up near Palm Springs, Calif., with a mother who didn’t cook, but hosted themed parties for holidays, birthdays and Girl Scout events. “The tablescaping around a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/04/dining/baked-macaroni-cheese-recipe-homemade.html" title="">Stouffer’s</a> lasagna was insane,” Ms. Boyer-White said.</p><p>Every fall, the family went to the Los Angeles County Fair and Ms. Boyer-White was drawn to the tablescaping competition. “I’d dream about what I would do at my table and I’d try to get the other kids to talk about it with me, but nobody was biting.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>When she met Shannon Watters, a comic book editor and writer, they started dating and tablescaping became their joint project. This year, Ms. Watters and Ms. Boyer-White entered their “Murder Mystery Dinner Party” table, reminiscent of the Edward Gorey-illustrated introduction to the PBS <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/masterpiece-mystery-opening-sequence-2004-version-no-audio/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Masterpiece series “Mystery</a>!”</p><p>It was filled with line drawings, handmade characters that danced on the table and a tablecloth cross-stitched to look like inked wood grain. It wasn’t just a table, but an ephemeral shrine to the couple’s shared vision of beauty, whimsy and craft.</p><p>In times of uncertainty, it can be a relief to focus your attention on completely transforming a small space within your jurisdiction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Courtney Carman’s “Red, White and Blue” table took first place for representation of theme.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtney Carman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many tablescapers find pleasure in the smallest details that delight the people who care to pay attention.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtney Carman</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Courtney Carman, a psychologist exposed to vicarious trauma in her day to day work, started competitive tablescaping in 2017. “Tablescaping is a way to escape,” she said. “It’s a way to have this beautiful magical thing that you can control.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>When Ms. Carman was growing up, her family ate meals in front of the TV, except for special occasions or holidays. Now, her father helps her set up her competition table, and even if Ms. Carman is eating alone at home while watching a show, she sets a simple place for herself with a folded paper napkin.</p><p>On <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/thanksgiving" title="">Thanksgiving</a>, Ms. Carman will fill her holiday table with pumpkins and the pine cones she collects from around her home in Lake Arrowhead, Calif. She won’t starch the napkins and iron them so they’re practically crispy, as she does at the fair — too much! — but she will go through the trouble of folding every napkin.</p><p>“The tree shape is so easy and looks so cute,” she said. “It’s just one extra thing that will delight somebody.”</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tejal Rao is a critic at large for the Food section and contributes regularly to The New York Times Magazine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tejal-rao">More about Tejal Rao</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
