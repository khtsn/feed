Two or three Indian planes went down on the Indian side of the border, according to Indian officials and Western diplomats, as well as local media reports and eyewitness descriptions. It was exactly what India had hoped to avoid after having suffered a similar embarrassment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/world/asia/india-military-united-states-china.html" title="">the last time it exchanged military strikes with Pakistan</a>, in 2019.</p><p>The question now is whether Pakistan will decide that it must answer India’s strikes on the Pakistani heartland with an attack of its own on Indian soil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volunteers carrying a body recovered from the rubble of a damaged mosque in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">M.D. Mughal/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>For now, Pakistan says it is keeping all options open.
