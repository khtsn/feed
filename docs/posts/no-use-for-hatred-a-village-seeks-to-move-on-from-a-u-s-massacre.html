The parking lot held a single car. Only a wide sign near the entrance explained the significance of the location.</p><p>It showed a map of the area as it looked on the morning of March 16, 1968, when a company of American soldiers showed up and killed more than 500 women, children and older men, raping girls, mutilating bodies and burning homes with families still inside.</p><p>One of the massacre’s survivors, Nguyen Hong Mang, would tell me later that he had met the soldiers with a smile, shouting, “Welcome, Americans!” He was 14.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Minutes later, he and his family and neighbors were being lined up and shot, crumpling into a pile of the dead and nearly dead.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I survived because the Americans shooting everyone ran out of bullets,” said Nguyen Hong Mang, who was 14 when American soldiers came to his village.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linh Pham for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Retelling such horrors, to visiting strangers and with a museum right where you live, takes a special kind of courage. Most war memorials in Vietnam focus on revolutionary heroes. My Lai is pure tragedy. And the way the affected hamlets deal with one of the war’s worst atrocities says a lot about how to honor trauma without becoming defined by its scars.</p><p>Over two days in Son My, the village 95 miles south of Danang that includes My Lai and other rural hamlets, I was often struck by efforts to treat hatred like a virus, to suppress its power, to avoid passing it on or letting it grow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Five decades ago, weary American soldiers angry about recently killed colleagues took out their murderous frustration on helpless villagers. This year, the most bloodthirsty platoon commander, William L. Calley Jr., who was convicted of killing at least 22 people, died, spurring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/william-calley-dead.html" title="">obituaries</a> and bouts of <a href="https://www.oxfreepress.com/reflections-lieutenant-william-l-calley-jr-and-vietnam/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reflection</a> in the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yet survivors in the village mostly did not even know he was dead; instead, they spoke of those who did not kill, or who tried to stop the slaughter.</p><p>My experience of such generosity began with a museum video offering only a brief mention of Lieutenant Calley. It noted that while 25 soldiers were charged with murder, only he was found guilty, with a sentence that amounted to house arrest for a little more than three years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Government officials laying a wreath at a memorial to the massacre.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linh Pham for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The video mostly featured the museum’s director, Pham Thanh Cong, another survivor, meeting an American soldier involved in the massacre, and staying calm.</p><p>A second video, in Vietnamese, was even more magnanimous. A narrator highlighted a handful of humane soldiers: one who intentionally shot himself in the leg to avoid taking part in the violence, a helicopter crew that eventually intervened to stop the killing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On the way out, I flipped through a book of visitors’ comments.</p><p>“That Calley is free, that no one paid, is all wrong,” wrote an American from Seattle in 2003.</p><p>A few pages later, a Vietnamese official, Nguyen Dang Vang, described the village’s resilience as “an inspiration for future generations,” barely mentioning the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Renovation of some of the graves in Son My.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linh Pham for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>It was the sign of a resilient nation — Vietnam often tops <a href="https://www.gallup-international.com/survey-results-and-news/survey-result/not-much-of-a-free-world-but-at-least-optimistic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gallup’s ranking of the most optimistic</a> countries — eager to seek prosperity with past enemies.</p><p>“One of the first things that many Americans notice when they go to Vietnam is that Americans are not just welcomed, not just tolerated — there is genuine enthusiasm,” said Edward Miller, a historian of modern Vietnam at Dartmouth.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In part, he noted, that is because the war’s atrocities have been countered by time. More than half of Vietnam’s population was born after the conflict ended. Many Vietnamese also hold fast to an idealized version of the United States, shaped by relatives who moved there.</p><p>But Americans tend to oversimplify Vietnamese good will.

Pham Thi Tuong, 64, was just a young girl when the Americans landed.

It started out with grisly photographs. A more recent design features a diorama of armed Americans looming over villagers — still frightening, but less graphic.</p><p>The longtime director, Mr. Cong, 67, the only survivor in his family after an American soldier threw a grenade where they were hiding, said the museum existed to remind people what happened “and to cherish and protect peace.” He approved the cooler of ice cream.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers’ boots and bare feet are designed into the walkways at the Son My memorial.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linh Pham for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><p>He said he had been touched by what he had witnessed over the years, especially when a few remorseful American soldiers returned and spent hours on their knees, repenting.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Lieutenant Calley was not among them.</p><p>“I always kept the door open, welcoming him to return,” Mr. Cong said. “Now he is gone.
