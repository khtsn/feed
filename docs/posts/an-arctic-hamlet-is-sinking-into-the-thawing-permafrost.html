These “thaw slumps” measured several hundred feet wide and just as deep.</p><p>Jaden Cockney, 17, clambered down the side of one slump as his boss, William Dillon, looked on cautiously. Jaden was part of the team that Mr. Dillon, 69, had created to measure the retreating permafrost. Only a few decades earlier, the permafrost had lain just several inches below much of the region’s surface. But now it was thawing so rapidly that it was being pushed further and further underground. Along shorelines, it collapsed into lakes or the Arctic Ocean.</p><p>For centuries, the Western Arctic has been home to Mr. Dillon and his ancestors, the Inuvialuit, as the region’s Inuit are called. But these days, the thaw slumps — like the one Mr. Dillon’s team was documenting 10 miles south of their hamlet, Tuktoyaktuk — are the most dramatic evidence of a phenomenon that could turn the local Inuvialuit into Canada’s first climate refugees.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three people in rain gear lay belly-down near a cliff overlooking a lake." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/02/multimedia/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl/02canada-arctic-permafrost-01-vmzl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b3b35a97-97d8-5639-a0b5-51fc08226151" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>William Dillon, Jaden Cockney and their colleague, Derek Panaktalok, overlooking a permafrost thaw slump at the edge of Tiktalik Lake.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Dillon collects data on the climate and the evolution of the territory for the Tuktoyaktuk Community Corporation and has been monitoring the land for three decades.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tuktoyaktuk itself now stands face to face with the Arctic Ocean’s increasingly angry Beaufort Sea, and rests atop 1,300 feet to 1,600 feet of thawing permafrost threatening to sink it.</p><p>At the bottom of the slump, the teenager advanced by leaping from mounds of solid-looking dirt to torn patches of tundra, avoiding the clay-like mud where he would have sunk. He was about to explore what even many permafrost scientists never manage to see up close.</p><p>Poking his measuring probe here and there, he approached a large column of ice that was somehow still standing. All around, the permafrost had vanished, leaving behind a chaotic landscape strewed with jagged patches of tundra, uprooted brown shrubs and previously frozen dirt that had turned into mud with sudden violence. Long-trapped organic matter was released, giving off the smell of freshly peeled potatoes and unlocking methane and carbon dioxide — both climate-warming gases — into the atmosphere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/02vid-canada-permafrost--35749-cover/02vid-canada-permafrost--35749-cover-jumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/29/02vid-canada-permafrost--35749-cover/02vid-canada-permafrost--35749-cover-jumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/11/29/130356_1_02vid-canada-permafrost--35749_wg_mobile_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A permafrost thaw slump on the shores of Lake Tiktalik in Canada’s Western Arctic.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Jaden led the monitors back to higher ground and crept toward the edge of the thaw slump.</p><p>“Billy, can I go and take a look?” he asked Mr. Dillon without stopping.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The permafrost had disappeared under the slump’s edge.

Did he worry about having to leave Tuktoyaktuk?</p><p>“I don’t know, not really, kind of,” he said, then added, “Maybe as I get older, I might.”</p><p>Jaden was in 10th grade and worked as a monitor so that he could save for a snowmobile. His boss had been monitoring the land for three decades. Mr. Dillon did not think Tuktoyaktuk would disappear in his lifetime, but he was certain it would in Jaden’s.</p><p>“Nobody really wants to take the responsibility for saying we have to move,” Mr. Dillon said, adding, “But the whole hamlet will be relocated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Dillon, center, accompanied by Jaden Cockney and Dray Illasiak, walking through the Arctic tundra near Lake Tiktalik.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-36d2501e">A Quarter of the World’s Permafrost</h2><p>Only a couple of decades ago, people burying loved ones in Tuktoyaktuk’s cemetery first had to light a fire. When enough of the permafrost just beneath the tundra had melted, a grave would be deep enough and a body could be laid to rest.</p><p>Nowadays, in some corners of the cemetery, probes are too short to find the permafrost. Along a deep fissure running across the cemetery, gravesites have caved in and crosses lean in the same direction like dominoes ready to topple over. Families had filled other gravesites with gravel to save them.</p><p>“If I ever become a billionaire, my family’s moving with me,” Mr. Dillon said, near a cross bearing the name of Eddie Tex Dillon, an older brother who had served as a mayor of the hamlet. “Go find some solid granite to bury my people in.”</p><p>The fate of the cemetery is one of the most sensitive issues to locals.</p><p>“We don’t ever relocate a cemetery in our Inuvialuit culture,” said Erwin Elias, Tuktoyaktuk’s mayor. “But we don’t want kids to be seeing coffins floating out into the ocean.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Despite the wave-breaking rocks installed behind the old Tuktoyaktuk cemetery, thawing permafrost is causing some parts of the cemetery to collapse. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shania Noksana, who lives in the town of Inuvik while completing her studies.

Boulders placed along the shoreline there failed to save a handful of houses from having to be moved in 2020.</p><p>“There was one kid in my class — his name is Bob,” said Jaden. “There was a white house right at the end, and he used to live there.”</p><p>About 1,000 people live in Tuktoyaktuk, a community that grew during the Cold War as a station for a continentwide anti-Soviet radar system. Mr. Dillon, whose parents were employed at several stations, worked for a Canadian oil company when Tuktoyaktuk became a hub for exploration in the Western Arctic in the 1970s. Now Tuktoyaktuk has become a hot spot for global permafrost research.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A decrease in sea ice because of warming weather has contributed to the Arctic’s heating up four times as fast as the global average in the past four decades, making the region one of the hardest hit by climate change. Warmer temperatures have caused the thawing of the Earth’s permafrost — ice mixed with soil, sand and organic matter that has been continuously frozen, some for hundreds of thousands of year.</p><p>Canada has about a quarter of the world’s permafrost — the most after Russia — and in its Western Arctic, thaw slumps have increased in recent years, said Dustin Whalen, a Canadian government physical scientist who began researching in the region two decades ago.</p><p>Back then, thaw slumps were limited to areas most susceptible to warming, Mr. Whalen said. “Now they seem to be everywhere.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Dillon and Jaden Cockney taking measurements of the depth of permafrost at different points in the hamlet.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A notebook in which Mr. Dillon collects climate and land data.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Whalen helped start the monitoring program in 2019, training Mr. Dillon and other Inuvialuit. No other community keeps such close track of the permafrost, providing continuous data to scientists, Mr. Whalen said. But now other experts from all over the world have gravitated to the hamlet.</p><p>“We really have very little understanding of half of the world’s permafrost, which is in Russia, other than what we can glean from satellites,” said Christopher Burn, a permafrost expert at Carleton University in Ottawa and former president of the International Permafrost Association.</p><p>But Tuktoyaktuk is a window. “What is happening there is being replicated around the Arctic,” Mr. Burn said.</p><p>At this point, the climate-warming gases discharged by degrading permafrost are believed to be offset by the concomitant growth of vegetation that absorbs carbon, Mr. Burn said. But scientists believe that in the next 10 to 15 years, if climate change stays on its current trajectory, the permafrost regions will become net emitters of greenhouse gases, he said.</p><p>“By the end of the century,” Mr. Burn said, “we will have emissions from permafrost that are equivalent to the third or fourth most-emitting country in the world.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Erosion along a road in Tuktoyaktuk.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-36a21652">‘It Will Go’</h2><p>Mr. Dillon didn’t need to open his yellow notebook to remember when he first noticed a startling site outside a red house perched on a promontory jutting into Tuktoyaktuk’s inland harbor, the one protected by a shrinking barrier island.</p><p>“Aug. 16, 2023 — this is when we first noticed it,” he said.</p><p>Under the house, the thawing permafrost revealed — alarmingly — that the building rested mostly on sand. The adjoining land was scarred with telltale fissures and parts of the shoreline were slumping into the water.

Both men had been classmates at an Anglican residential school, and as adults Mr. Pokiak had been Mr. Dillon’s boss at the Inuvialuit Land Administration, a regional organization that manages land owned by the Inuvialuit people. Mr. Dillon had worked as an environmental monitor there for 27 years.</p><p>Like others in town, Mr. Pokiak didn’t want to leave. He built his house three decades ago, and his two brothers erected their own houses nearby, and they called the area “Pokesville.” As the two men sat at his kitchen table, he pressed Mr. Dillon for information on how bad the permafrost was.</p><p>“Those two sloping sites, they’re moving downward,” Mr. Dillon told Mr. Pokiak. “And if those two are moving, this is moving as well, Calvin.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“Yeah,” Mr. Pokiak said, adding after a long pause, “I mean, personally, I think I was happy I moved out here.
