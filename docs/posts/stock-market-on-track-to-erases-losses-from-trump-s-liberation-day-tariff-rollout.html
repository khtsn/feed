    <h1>Stock Market on Track to Erases Losses From Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ Tariff Rollout</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.</p><p>Still, despite the recent optimism and recovery, the S&amp;P 500 is more than 7 percent below its recent high in mid-February. It has fallen about 5 percent since Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January.</p><p>Questions remain about whether Mr. Trump’s tariffs might cause a sharp slowdown in economic growth, which could result if companies start pulling back on hiring, spending and investments amid the uncertainty.</p><p>Though Mr. Trump backed off the most extreme tariffs on dozens of countries, many imports into the United States now face new taxes of at least 10 percent, while products from China are being taxed a minimum of 145 percent. On Friday, a provision that had allowed for low-value shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong to evade tariffs altogether closed. And on Saturday, new tariffs of 25 percent on imported auto parts are expected to take effect. That’s in addition to a tax of 25 percent on imported cars that already took effect in April.</p><p>Volatility in recent weeks has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/trump-stocks-tariffs.html" title="">underscored</a> the degree to which sentiment on Wall Street is still driven by concern about the economic fallout from the Trump administration’s policies. Mr. Trump’s 90-day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-stocks-china.html" title="">pause</a> of many of the tariffs that he announced on April 2 will end in July.</p></div></div>
