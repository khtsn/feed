But the S&amp;P 500 has been edging higher for days — Friday’s gain would be its ninth consecutive daily increase — as Mr. Trump and members of his administration raised hopes that trade tensions would ease, including by indicating they were willing to engage in talks with China.</p><p>The two countries remain far from any deal that would resolve the trade war between them, but even the prospect of talks has been enough to ease the worst of the anxiety that gripped investors a month ago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.</p><p>Still, despite the recent optimism and recovery, the S&amp;P 500 is more than 7 percent below its recent high in mid-February. It has fallen about 5 percent since Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January.</p><p>Questions remain about whether Mr. Trump’s tariffs might cause a sharp slowdown in economic growth, which could result if companies start pulling back on hiring, spending and investments amid the uncertainty.</p><p>Though Mr. Trump backed off the most extreme tariffs on dozens of countries, many imports into the United States now face new taxes of at least 10 percent, while products from China are being taxed a minimum of 145 percent. On Friday, a provision that had allowed for low-value shipments from China and Hong Kong to evade tariffs altogether closed. And on Saturday, new tariffs of 25 percent on imported auto parts are expected to take effect. That’s in addition to a tax of 25 percent on imported cars that already took effect in April.</p><p>Volatility in recent weeks has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/trump-stocks-tariffs.html" title="">underscored</a> the degree to which sentiment on Wall Street is still driven by concern about the economic fallout from the Trump administration’s policies. Mr. Trump’s 90-day <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariffs-stocks-china.html" title="">pause</a> of many of the tariffs that he announced on April 2 will end in July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“The damage to economic momentum has already been done,” said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison Investments. “Deals may come, but the real question is how long the data will take to reflect the harm.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a Times business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Foreign Policy</strong><strong>: </strong>President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/world/europe/100-days-trump-us-foreign-policy.html">Trump’s approach to foreign policy</a> in his second term has included threats to the national sovereignty of Canada and Greenland, walking back a decades-long march toward free trade and an exploitative mineral deal with Ukraine.
