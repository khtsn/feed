But the key vote came earlier, when after days of Democratic agonizing, Mr. Schumer and nine other members of his caucus supplied the votes needed to allow it to move ahead, effectively thwarting a filibuster by their own party in a bid to prevent a shutdown.</p><div><p>The action came just hours before a midnight deadline to avoid a lapse in funding.</p><p>The spending debate inflamed intraparty tensions among Democrats that have simmered for weeks about how to mount the most effective resistance to Mr. Trump at a time when he is taking full advantage of his governing trifecta — control of the White House, Senate and House — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html" title="">to trample on congressional power</a>, slashing federal funding and firing government workers with little regard for the guardrails that normally constrain the executive branch.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/schumer-trump-government-shutdown.html" title="">Mr. Schumer’s abrupt decision to reverse himself</a> and allow the spending legislation to advance stunned many of his colleagues and angered many Democratic lawmakers and progressive activists who were spoiling for a shutdown fight to show their determination to counter Mr. Trump. Many in his party vociferously opposed the temporary spending measure, arguing that it was a capitulation to the president that would supercharge his efforts, and those of his billionaire ally Elon Musk, to defund and dismantle broad swaths of the government.</p><p>As recently as Wednesday, Mr. Schumer was arguing strongly against the bill and proposing a monthlong alternative to allow Congress to reach an agreement on individual spending measures with specific instructions over how federal funding should be doled out.</p><p>But he reversed course on Thursday after Republicans rejected a shorter-term stopgap bill, with a shutdown looming and amid concerns that Democrats would be blamed.</p><p>Recognizing that Democrats were left with only an up-or-down alternative, Mr. Schumer argued that a shutdown would only play into the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, ceding more power to them to commandeer federal agencies. In a shutdown, he said, the Trump administration could decide which federal workers would be deemed “nonessential” and furloughed. And he warned that Republicans would have little incentive to reopen the government.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Senator Chuck Schumer said he would back a Republican bill to fund the government.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>“As bad as the C.R. is,” Mr. Schumer said on Friday morning, using shorthand for continuing resolution, “I believe that allowing President Trump to take more power is a far worse option.”</p><p>Democrats joining Mr. Schumer in voting to move it forward included several members of his leadership team — Senators Dick Durbin of Illinois, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada — and two who have announced their plans to retire: Senators Gary Peters of Michigan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Democratic Senators John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire also voted yes, as did Senator Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with their party.</p><p>Ms. Shaheen and Mr. King also voted for final passage. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to oppose it.</p><p>“Today’s vote on the continuing resolution was a difficult and close call, but ultimately, I made the determination that a flawed bill was better than no bill at all,” Mr. Schatz said in a statement. “A shutdown would enable Donald Trump and Elon Musk to unilaterally determine that the vast majority of federal workers are not essential. And given the number of federal workers in Hawaii, mass furloughs would be deeply painful for people across the state.”</p><p>The Republican stopgap legislation would largely keep federal funds flowing at levels set during the Biden administration, but would increase spending for the military by $6 billion. It would not include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/us/politics/congress-earmarks-spending-bill.html" title="">funds for any earmarks for projects</a> in lawmakers’ districts or states, saving roughly $13 billion.</p><p>It also would effectively slash the District of Columbia’s budget by roughly $1 billion over the next six months. But as part of Mr. Schumer’s agreement with Republicans to allow the bill to move forward, the Senate was set to consider a separate measure that would reverse that cut, which local leaders had warned would force dramatic cuts to essential services.</p><p>What most concerns Democrats is that the stopgap measure does not contain the specific congressional instructions to allocate money for programs usually included in spending bills. Top Democrats, including Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the party’s lead appropriator, have warned that the lack of explicit directions would essentially create slush funds for the Trump administration at a time when it has already disregarded spending directives set by Congress.</p><p>“We have already seen how far President Trump, Elon Musk, and Russ Vought are willing to twist — and outright break — our laws to suit their will,” Ms. Murray said, referring to Russell Vought, Mr. Trump’s budget director. “But House Republicans are setting them up to make everything so far look like child’s play.”</p><p>The measure’s Democratic opponents included senators from across the ideological spectrum. A number of centrists voted against the measure, as well as those facing tough re-election contests next year.</p><p>The intraparty divide over the measure boiled down to a dispute among Democrats about which of two bad outcomes would be worse for the country. Mr. Schumer and those who voted to allow the spending patch to move forward argued that failing to do so would cause a shutdown that would give Mr. Trump maximum latitude to fund or defund whatever parts of government he saw fit to. But other Democrats said funding the government when the president was moving unilaterally to cut programs and employees would endorse his actions and cede even more congressional control.</p><p>Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who will face voters next year, said in a statement that he was against the legislation in part because it failed “to impose any constraints on the reckless and out-of-control Trump administration.”</p><p>“Both parties in Congress must fulfill our constitutional obligation to check the president,” Mr. Ossoff said.</p><p>Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader, blamed Mr. Schumer and Democrats for the funding predicament Congress found itself in because of a failure to push annual spending bills through while the Senate was under Democratic control last year.</p><p>“To be clear, Republicans aren’t thrilled about another C.R.,” Mr. Thune said Friday before the vote. “But it is our best option to make sure that last year’s failure by Democrats doesn’t interfere with this year’s appropriations process.”</p><p>He pledged to make the annual spending bills a priority to try to avert a similar pileup next year.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NTFhZmE4LTM4YjgtNWI1MS1hYzM3LWJhMTJhZTNjZjBlZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news#trump-order-voice-of-america" data-source-id="100000010054142"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager"><img alt="Tyler Pager" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/reader-center/author-tyler-pager/author-tyler-pager-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-15T05:24:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 15, 2025, 1:24 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tyler-pager" itemprop="name">Tyler Pager</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting on the White House </span></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE0NTFhZmE4LTM4YjgtNWI1MS1hYzM3LWJhMTJhZTNjZjBlZA=="><a href="#trump-order-voice-of-america">Trump orders gutting of 7 agencies, including Voice of America’s parent.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Voice of America building in Washington. President Trump is seeking to dismantle the federal agency that oversees the outlet.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrew Harnik/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump signed an executive order on Friday seeking to dismantle seven additional federal agencies, including the one that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded media outlets around the world.</p><p>Mr. Trump directed the heads of the agencies, largely obscure entities that address issues like labor mediation and homelessness prevention, to eliminate all functions that are not statutorily mandated. The leaders should also “reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law,” the order said.</p><div><p>Like many of the president’s moves in his wide-ranging effort to shrink the government, the order appears to test the bounds of his authority. Voice of America’s parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, for example, is congressionally chartered as an independent agency, and Congress passed a law in 2020 intended to limit the power of the agency’s presidentially appointed chief executive.</p><p>Some of the Trump administration’s moves to slash agencies have been halted by federal judges, including on Thursday, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/judges-federal-workers-reinstatement.html" title="">a pair of court rulings</a> called for agencies to reinstate likely thousands of federal employees who were fired last month because they had probationary status.</p><p>In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.444883/gov.uscourts.cand.444883.132.0_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an opinion issued Friday evening</a>, a federal judge in California made clear he did not believe the administration’s claims that federal agencies were acting of their own accord when they fired those probationary employees. Judge William H. Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California listed more than a dozen examples of officials telling employees that the mass firings had been carried out at the behest of the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>In addition to Voice of America, the Agency for Global Media funds Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. The organization, with a budget of roughly $270 million and more than 2,000 employees, broadcasts in 49 languages. It has a weekly estimated audience of more than 361 million people.</p><p>By Saturday morning, many journalists and other employees at Voice of America were informed they were being placed on administrative leave, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times. Journalists there said the cuts were so widespread that they would effectively shut down the international broadcaster.</p><p>The media outlets are intended to provide unbiased news to audiences around the world, but Mr. Trump has criticized its editorial decisions since his first term. Mr. Trump had already stirred fears at the agency by tapping Kari Lake, a fierce loyalist who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate in Arizona, to serve as a special adviser there.</p><p>The other agencies Mr. Trump targeted Friday are the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which works to prevent and resolve work stoppages and labor disputes; the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank; the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which funds and supports museums, libraries and archives; the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which works to prevent and end homelessness; the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides financial assistance to struggling communities; and the Minority Business Development Agency, which aims to bolster minority-owned businesses.</p><p>Within seven days, the heads of the entities are required to submit to Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, their plans for complying with the order and outline which of their functions are statutorily required.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump took office, the billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have sought to drastically reshape the federal government by cutting staff and programs. On Tuesday, the Education Department announced it was firing more than 1,300 workers, and after hundreds accepted separation packages, the agency is set to be left with roughly half the number of employees that it started the year with.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s group has trumpeted saving taxpayers billions of dollars, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" title="">though its claims have been undermined by posting error-filled data</a>.</p><p>Zach Montague<!-- --> and <!-- -->David Enrich<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="21" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-RW1iZWRkZWRJbnRlcmFjdGl2ZTpueXQ6Ly9lbWJlZGRlZGludGVyYWN0aXZlLzFjMTgyNjZkLTRiMDgtNWFhMi04MjkyLTk4OWRlYmQzM2EyYg=="><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="senate-government-funding-embed" data-id="100000010049249" data-source-id="100000010049249"><div slug="senate-government-funding-embed" data-sourceid="100000010049249" id="embed-id-100000010049249">

It was the second time federal officials had suddenly cleared the base of migrants who had been flown there. In late February, the government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/guantanamo-venezuelans-trump-migrants.html" title="">repatriated all but one</a> of 178 detained migrants to Venezuela after they spent just a few weeks at the facility. One migrant was brought back to the United States.</p><p>Judge Nichols on Friday considered two challenges brought by migrants and advocacy groups on their behalf. Less than 30 minutes after the lawyers finished their arguments, he said the plaintiffs had “failed to established they are suffering irreparable harm” that warranted a temporary order to halt the administration’s policies.</p><p>Judge Nichols said that if the government sent any of the migrants in question to Guantánamo, he would be prepared to consider issuing an emergency order. Lawyers for the Trump administration said they would notify the judge if any plaintiffs were sent there, and were instructed to inform the court by Wednesday of how early in the relocation process they would do so.</p><p>But Judge Nichols expressed doubts that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits of the cases, when no migrants remained at Guantánamo.</p><p>In the first lawsuit, filed in response to the administration sending Venezuelan citizens to Guantánamo, Lee Gelernt, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, argued that government had unfairly barred migrants from having in-person access to lawyers. </p><p>Sarah Wilson, a Justice Department lawyer, countered that the work of relocating migrants there was still too new to accommodate lawyers, given the logistical challenges and need for security clearances.</p><p>The second lawsuit, filed by 10 migrants who claimed to be at risk of being transferred to Guantánamo because of their nationalities and removal orders against them, challenged the legality of the transfers. The plaintiffs asserted that the government has no right to detain migrants outside the United States, and that conditions at Guantánamo were worse than those at domestic detention facilities.</p><p>Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, argued that since immigration enforcement by definition involves moving migrants across borders, the administration could keep migrants with removal orders in American custody overseas. The practice was akin to transporting migrants over international waters from Hawaii to the mainland, Mr. Ensign added, or through other countries while being deported to their home nations.</p><p>But Mr. Gelernt called Mr. Ensign’s comparisons misleading, saying the migrants at Guantánamo had not been in transit or in the process of being removed. No prior administration had argued that immigration law gave the government the right to detain migrants extraterritorially, he added.</p><p>Mr. Gelernt also pointed to the conditions some migrants were subject to at Guantánamo, including strip searches, shackling and solitary confinement. That treatment is harsher than conditions found in detention centers in the United States, he said, making relocation there unfair and unconstitutional.</p><p>Judge Nichols was particularly focused on the question of whether immigration law gave the government the right to detain migrants at extraterritorial facilities. Though he did not offer an answer, he said it was “a serious question.”</p><p>But Judge Nichols rejected the migrants’ argument that staying at Guantánamo, however briefly, would cause them irreparable harm. If migrants who brought the lawsuits were moved to Guantánamo, he said, lawyers could demand an emergency order to bring them back to the United States, likely within days.</p><p>Outside the courthouse, Mr. Gelernt expressed frustration, saying the administration had sidestepped challenges to its policy by abruptly relocating the migrants.</p><p>He suggested that the advocacy groups would try to mount a broader challenge by filing a class-action lawsuit. “We see now what the government is doing by continually trying to” get cases dismissed as moot “by moving people around,” Mr. Gelernt added.</p><p>Mr. Ensign said the Justice Department would ask to dismiss the case.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2MyYTcwZDNjLWE2ZjctNTAzMC04NGYzLTI5ODlhMGQ2YzEwZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news#fact-check-trump-justice-immigration-crime-eggs" data-source-id="100000010053605"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></span></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-15T02:11:44.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 14, 2025, 10:11 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-cameron" itemprop="name">Chris Cameron</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs" itemprop="name">Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye" itemprop="name">Danielle Kaye</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>Fact Check</p><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2MyYTcwZDNjLWE2ZjctNTAzMC04NGYzLTI5ODlhMGQ2YzEwZg=="><a href="#fact-check-trump-justice-immigration-crime-eggs">These are the falsehoods Trump revived in his speech at the Justice Department.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump spoke at the Department of Justice on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump repeated a number of well-trodden falsehoods on Friday in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-speech-justice-department.html" title="">grievance-fueled speech</a> at the Justice Department, veering from prepared remarks to single out lawyers and prosecutors and assail the criminal investigations into him.</p><p>His remarks, billed as a policy address, were wide-ranging, touching on immigration, crime and the price of eggs.</p><div><p>Here’s a fact-check.</p><h2 id="link-634b522b">His legal troubles</h2><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.”</em></p><p><em>“They spied on my campaign, launched one hoax and disinformation operation after another, broke the law on a colossal scale, persecuted my family, staff and supporters, raided my home Mar-a-Lago and did everything within their power to prevent me from becoming the president of the United States.”</em></p><p><strong>This lacks evidence.</strong> Mr. Trump’s claims refer to a wide array of investigations and criminal cases that occurred before, during and after his first term as president.</p><p>The F.B.I. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/trump-russia" title="">investigated contacts</a> between the Trump campaign and Russian officials; Mr. Trump’s deputy attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html" title="">appointed a special counsel</a> that continued that investigation during his first term; after Mr. Trump left office, he was then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/trump-investigations-charges-indictments.html" title="">charged in four state and federal criminal cases</a> — two concerning his efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/trump-georgia-prosecution-delay.html" title="">overturn the results of the 2020 election</a> and one related to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-classified-documents.html" title="">retention of classified documents after he left office</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/us/politics/trump-nauta-oliveira-dismiss-charges.html" title="">Employees</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-subpoena.html" title="">family members</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/paul-manafort-trial-verdict.html" title="">allies of Mr. Trump</a> became entangled in those cases at various points.</p><p>But the president and his supporters have provided no evidence of a vast, yearslong conspiracy to coordinate these investigations — taking place over nearly a decade across three presidential administrations — as a political weapon against him.</p><p>While the F.B.I. privately investigated Mr. Trump’s campaign for ties to Russia in 2016, James Comey, the bureau’s director at the time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/hilary-clinton-male-voters-donald-trump.html" title="">publicly announced an investigation</a> of Mr. Trump’s presidential rival at the time, Hillary Clinton, in a move that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/politics/hillary-clinton-james-comey.html" title="">critics said had aided Mr. Trump politically.</a></p><p>Officials in the Trump administration later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html" title="">expressed concern about Mr. Trump’s desire</a> to shut down the investigation of his campaign after he took office, and Rod Rosenstein, Mr. Trump’s deputy attorney general, appointed a special counsel to shield the investigation from political pressure and avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest within the government.</p><p>After Mr. Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election, Mr. Trump was indicted in four criminal felony cases. Of the four cases, two were brought by state or local prosecutors, meaning that the Justice Department has no control over them. His two other criminal cases <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel.html" title="">were overseen by a special counsel</a>, appointed to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest by President Joseph R.

We removed the senior F.B.I. officials who misdirected resources to send SWAT teams after grandmothers and J6 hostages.”</em></p><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Mr. Trump, in one of his first official acts in his second term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6.html" title="">pardoned hundreds of people</a> charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Many of those included people who had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/jan-6-trump-pardon-capitol-riots-video-evidence.html" title="">convicted of violent crimes</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/08/us/politics/john-banuelos-jan-6-gun-charges.html" title="">weapons charges</a>. Others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/us/politics/edward-kelley-guilty-jan-6-plot.html" title="">had threatened law enforcement officials</a> who had investigated the attack.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/us/politics/january-6-capitol-riot-trump.html" title="">sought to rewrite the history of the attack</a>, portraying the rioters as martyrs to his political cause. He has also singled out the case of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-praying-grandma-jan-6-7e404e0e228d6e5c8f63688cc2a61f3f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rebecca Lavrenz</a>, who promoted herself online as the “J6 praying grandma,” for her conviction on misdemeanor charges in connection with the riot. There is no evidence that Ms. Lavrenz was the target of a police SWAT raid.</p><h2 id="link-64495508">Parents, anti-abortion activists and Catholics</h2><p>What WAS Said</p><p><em>The Biden administration “set loose violent criminals while targeting patriotic parents at school board meetings; they drop charges against antifa and Hamas supporters while labeling traditional Catholics as domestic terrorists.”</em></p><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Mr. Trump’s claims about the persecution of parents and Catholics stem from F.B.I. efforts to track threats made against school boards, teachers and other officials, as well as <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fbi-anti-catholic-memo.pdf?_gl=1*1h4umhm*_ga*NTg2NDIzMTA0LjE2OTU3NDA5OTA.*_ga_1818ZEQW81*MTcwMzYwNTQ4Ni4xLjAuMTcwMzYwNTQ4Ni4wLjAuMA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a leaked memo prepared by an F.B.I. field office</a> that warned of the potential for extremism for adherents of a “radical-traditionalist Catholic” ideology.</p><p>Mr. Trump and other Republicans seized on both efforts as evidence that the Biden administration sought to target parents concerned about education efforts opposed on the right — like inclusive policies toward transgender students and diversity initiatives — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/us/politics/trump-faith-and-freedom-evangelical-martyr.html" title="">to repress Christian groups.</a></p><p>In 2021, the F.B.I. had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/us/politics/fbi-school-threats.html" title="">created a “threat tag”</a> to apply to reports of threats, harassment and violence against school officials, which had risen significantly at the time. Such tags are used by the bureau to track trends and share information across offices, and are commonly used for crimes like drug offenses and human trafficking. House Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/28/us/politics/fbi-gop-attacks.html" title="">investigated and criticized those efforts</a>.</p><p>The memo warning of potential extremism among traditional Catholic groups had distinguished between those radicalized and not radicalized, saying “radical-traditionalist Catholics” who could potentially pose a threat were a small minority. The memo had also suggested gathering information and developing sources within churches to help identify suspicious activity.</p><p>The memo was later withdrawn after it became public, and the nation’s top law enforcement officials repeatedly denounced it. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/us/politics/catholic-extremists-fbi.html" title="">internal Justice Department investigation</a> later concluded that the memo had violated professional standards but showed “no evidence of malicious intent.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/us/politics/trump-biden-christianity.html" title="">Experts said at the time</a> that they were unaware of any data to support the idea that Catholics were being widely persecuted by the government for their faith — let alone at record levels. Mr. Biden is a practicing Catholic who often cited his faith for guidance on decisions in office.</p><p>What WAS Said</p><p><em>“They imported illegal alien murderers, drug dealers and child predators from all over the world to come into our country while putting elderly Christians and pro-life activists on trial for singing hymns and for saying prayers.”</em></p><p><strong>False.</strong> Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to the cases of some anti-abortion activists who were convicted of crimes against civil rights, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-pardon-abortion-clinic-activists.html" title="">who Mr. Trump pardoned soon after taking office</a>.</p><p>The protesters were not put on trial for praying, as Mr. Trump claimed, but for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/us/anti-abortion-activist-sentenced.html" title="">conspiring against civil rights and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act</a> — which makes it a crime to threaten, obstruct or injure a person seeking access to a reproductive health clinic or to damage clinic property. The defendants in the case had blockaded an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C., in October 2020.</p><h2 id="link-5df19d84">Immigration and crime</h2><p>What WAS Said</p><p><em>“Our first full month in office, we achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings ever recorded … it turned out that we really didn’t need new legislation. All you needed was a new president.”</em></p><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Mr. Trump is correct that illegal border crossings have declined drastically since he took office. That is in part because of a series of restrictions he imposed at the border and in part because Mexico, in response to his threat of tariffs, bolstered its migration enforcement. In February, illegal crossings reached a record low of about 8,300.</p><p>That said, illegal crossings began to decline after the Biden administration over the summer reached a similar agreement with Mexico and the United States imposed new restrictions that sharply curtailed asylum applications.</p><p>What WAS Said</p><p><em>“Under the Biden regime, average monthly homicides increased by 14 percent, property crimes rose tremendously, violent crime went up at least 37 percent that they know of, rapes soared by 42 percent, car theft rose by 48 percent and robbery surged 63 to 100 percent. They don’t even know what the number is.”</em></p><p><strong>This lacks evidence. </strong>It is unclear what statistics Mr. Trump is referring to in making his comparison, though the general intent is to paint a picture of an America experiencing soaring crime. But in 2024, when Mr. Biden was still in office, murders and crime in general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/briefing/murders-plunge.html" title="">declined in the country</a>. Robberies and rapes were lower than they were before the pandemic. Aggravated assaults were still elevated from the pre-Covid days, but they trended down in 2024.</p><p>What WAS Said</p><p><em>“They didn’t even know why. They imported illegal alien murderers, drug dealers, child predators, from all over the world to come into our country.”</em></p><p><strong>False. </strong>The Biden administration did not purposely allow criminals into the country, but it did experience a historic level of illegal crossings at the border. Homeland Security secretaries have long said most of the crossings are people fleeing poverty and persecution rather than violent criminals. During the campaign, Mr. Trump effectively highlighted crimes migrants had committed to build support for his immigration policies. But immigrants overall are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/briefing/the-myth-of-migrant-crime.html" title="">less likely</a> to commit crimes than people born in the United States, according to studies of arrest and <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31440" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incarceration rates</a>.</p><h2 id="link-262ea2d6">Egg prices</h2><p>What WAS Said</p><p><em>“By the way, price of eggs is down 35 percent in the last week and half.”</em></p><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Signs suggest that wholesale prices, meaning the price retailers pay to procure eggs, have dropped by at least 35 percent since the start the month. That is most likely a relief for consumers, though it remains unclear what exactly it will mean for prices in grocery aisles.</p><p>Data from the Agriculture Department shows that wholesale egg prices <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been falling</a> sharply since the beginning of March after soaring through February, from a national average of over $8 for a dozen large white eggs at the start of the month to under $5 this week. The department cited “no significant outbreaks” of bird flu so far this month and “rapidly improving” supply. (The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into major egg producers over prices, though producers point to bird flu as the key culprit.)</p><p>These prices are still well above long-term averages, though, and the extent to which lower wholesale prices are showing up in retail prices remains to be seen. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Wednesday showed that in February, egg prices rose 10.4 percent from the previous month, continuing their climb.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad2"><div id="ad-2" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzgzNzc3YjEyLWIwZTgtNTUxMy1hMjBiLWZiNThkNjQyNzFjYQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news#iowa-immigration-lawsuit" data-source-id="100000010054006"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith"><img alt="Mitch Smith" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/10/multimedia/author-mitch-smith/author-mitch-smith-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/10/multimedia/author-mitch-smith/author-mitch-smith-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/10/multimedia/author-mitch-smith/author-mitch-smith-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-15T01:55:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 14, 2025, 9:55 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith" itemprop="name">Mitch Smith</a></p><p>Reporting from Des Moines</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzgzNzc3YjEyLWIwZTgtNTUxMy1hMjBiLWZiNThkNjQyNzFjYQ=="><a href="#iowa-immigration-lawsuit">Justice Department moves to dismiss challenge to Iowa immigration law.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

A similar filing on Friday sought the dismissal of a Justice Department challenge to an Oklahoma immigration law that had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/us/oklahoma-immigration-law-judge.html" title="">also been blocked</a>.</p><div><p>Justice Department officials did not respond on Friday evening to questions about whether the Iowa filing signaled a broader policy shift on state-level immigration enforcement, which it had opposed during Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidency.</p><p>Attorney General Brenna Bird of Iowa, whose office has defended her state’s law in court, celebrated the dismissal motion and linked it to President Trump’s approach to immigration.</p><p>“When the Biden administration failed to do its job and secure our borders, Iowa stepped up. And we never backed down — even when Biden sued us for it,” Ms. Bird, a Republican, said in a statement. “Today, President Trump, again, proved that he has Iowa’s back and showcased his commitment to Making America Safe Again by dropping Biden’s ridiculous lawsuit.”</p><p>Yaakov M. Roth, an acting assistant attorney general, was one of the Justice Department lawyers who asked for the dismissal of the Iowa case. No similar dismissal motion appeared on Friday evening on the public docket for a challenge to a similar Texas law that Mr. Biden’s Justice Department also sued to block.</p><p>A federal district judge blocked Iowa from enforcing its law last year in separate challenges from the Justice Department and an immigrant rights group, the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/iowa-immigration-case.html" title="">kept in place the injunction</a> in the Justice Department’s challenge in a January ruling. The panel was composed of jurists appointed by Republican presidents.</p><p>“As a matter of politics, the new legislation might be defensible,” Judge Stephen Locher, a Biden appointee, wrote when he granted the injunction last year. “As a matter of constitutional law, it is not.”</p><p>Rita Bettis Austen, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, which is representing the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice in its lawsuit, said in a statement that “we remain steadfast in our commitment to working to keep this harmful law from being enforced in Iowa.”</p><p>The fight in Iowa is part of a broader effort by conservative states, including Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, to carve out a role in immigration enforcement by creating their own laws. In doing so, they entered legal territory that Mr. Biden’s Justice Department argued should be the exclusive domain of federal officials. The U.S. Supreme Court could ultimately consider the question of whether states can enforce their own immigration laws.</p><p>In November, Arizona voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-arizona-proposition-314-establish-new-crimes-involving-illegal-immigration-and-fentanyl.html" title="">approved</a> a ballot measure that would make it a state crime to enter the state outside official ports of entry or to refuse to comply with orders to leave the United States. That law would not take effect unless the courts allowed another state to enforce a similar law.</p><p>Details of the new laws vary from state to state. Iowa’s measure, passed in 2024 by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds, does not go as far as some others.</p><p>The Iowa legislation makes it a misdemeanor to enter the state if a person was previously deported, denied entry to the United States or left the country while facing a deportation order. In some cases, including if a person had certain prior convictions, the state crime would become a felony. Iowa police officers would not be allowed to make arrests under the legislation at schools, places of worship or health care facilities.</p><p>The Oklahoma law, known as H.B. 4156 and also backed by Republicans, would make it a crime to enter the state without legal authorization to be in the United States. The office of Gentner Drummond, the Oklahoma attorney general, celebrated the dismissal request on Friday.</p><p>“The nation’s porous southern border has been a serious threat to the safety and security of Oklahomans,” Mr. Drummond said in a statement. “The sooner we can finally enforce H.B. 4156, the better.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFlYWZkNTAxLTE4YmQtNTBiOC1hZDE5LWYyY2M1YTZiZGIyYQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news#south-africa-ambassador-marco-rubio" data-source-id="100000010053978"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/edward-wong"><img alt="Edward Wong" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/multimedia/author-edward-wong/author-edward-wong-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/multimedia/author-edward-wong/author-edward-wong-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/multimedia/author-edward-wong/author-edward-wong-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon"><img alt="John Eligon" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-john-eligon/author-john-eligon-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-15T01:22:12.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 14, 2025, 9:22 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/edward-wong" itemprop="name">Edward Wong</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon" itemprop="name">John Eligon</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFlYWZkNTAxLTE4YmQtNTBiOC1hZDE5LWYyY2M1YTZiZGIyYQ=="><a href="#south-africa-ambassador-marco-rubio">The Trump administration has expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the U.S.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Africa’s ambassador to the United States, Ebrahim Rasool, in Washington in 2013.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cliff Owen/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>President Trump’s administration has officially expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the United States, a spokesman for the South African president said on Saturday, calling the decision “regrettable.”</p><p>The ambassador, Ebrahim Rasool, received an expulsion letter from the State Department, said Vincent Magwenya, the spokesman for President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa.

Here’s what to know:</p><h2 id="link-4b91e8b3">What happens in a government shutdown?</h2><p>When the government shuts down, agencies continue essential work, but federal employees and contractors are not paid. Many employees are furloughed until Congress acts to extend new funding.</p><p>Federal agencies typically make contingency plans that lay out who should keep working and what programs need to operate during a shutdown. But spending experts said the decisions about what is deemed “necessary” or “essential” ultimately rest with the White House Office of Management and Budget, currently run by Russell T. Vought.</p><p>During a shutdown in Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Vought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/us/politics/white-house-essential-shutdown.html" title="">worked to expand the number of federal employees required to work</a>. But he has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/russell-vought-budget-office-confirmation-hearing.html" title="">made clear his desire to vastly shrink the federal government</a>, culling its work force and trying to claw back congressionally approved funding for government agencies.</p><p>Laura Blessing, a fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute, said that given the Trump administration’s approach to government, it is not clear what might happen under a shutdown.</p><h2 id="link-56ac33d3">What powers does a president have during a shutdown?</h2><p>Shutdowns give the executive branch wide authority to decide how government should work while it lacks spending authority.</p><p>“When there is a government shutdown, the president has almost full flexibility to shut down discretionary spending that he does not consider to be essential,” said Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk have already moved unilaterally to shut off programs and in some cases whole agencies they dislike, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development. But doing so can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process, as the Trump administration has learned from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-funding-freeze-states.html" title="">array of lawsuits it has faced in recent weeks</a>.</p><p>In a shutdown, the paradigm would shift toward shuttering every federal department, potentially easing the path for the president and his team to decide which programs to prioritize and which to leave languishing without money to operate.</p><p>David Super, a professor who researches administrative law at Georgetown University, said Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought might be able to “effectively dictate the sequence of restarting the government” to favor their agenda, leaving federal employees on prolonged furlough in agencies that they oppose.</p><h2 id="link-3b2edb11">What happens under the funding extension?</h2><p>Senator Patty Murray of Washington, who had been pushing for a shorter-term funding extension to leave time for Congress to agree on regular spending bills, said on Friday that Republicans’ bill “hands a blank check to Elon Musk and Donald Trump to decide how our constituents’ taxpayer dollars get spent — all while they cut funding working people count on each and every day.”</p><p>In regular spending bills, members of Congress give specific directions about how they want federal money to be spent for the year. But temporary extensions, like the one that passed on Friday, only continue current funding levels without including any cuts, increases or limitations on their use.</p><p>Many Democrats argued that would give the Trump administration more discretion over federal funds even as it has taken steps to stop the spending of money authorized by Congress.</p><p>But Ms. Riedl said that under a temporary extension, presidents were generally expected to stick to the funding levels allocated by Congress, except where they had been explicitly modified.</p><p>“The president can’t just eliminate the Department of Education or send all the employees of a certain department home,” Ms. Riedl said. “He still must carry out the program and maintain spending at the required rates.”</p><p>Still, the Trump administration has made clear that it does not consider itself bound by Congress’s spending dictates.</p><p>“Trump and Musk are going to continue acting illegally no matter what this funding bill says,&#34; Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a video explaining his opposition. But by extending funding, he added, “Democrats risk putting a kind of bipartisan veneer of endorsement on their campaign to give our government to the billionaires and destroy the rule of law.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad4"><div id="ad-4" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid5">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZjkxMWY3NDMtMDIxOC01MjJhLWJjNjEtMWI4ZjAzNjBkNTQw"><div id="f911f743-0218-522a-bc61-1b8f0360d540" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news#f911f743-0218-522a-bc61-1b8f0360d540"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague"><img alt="Zach Montague" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/01/reader-center/author-zachary-montague/author-zachary-montague-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-15T00:56:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 14, 2025, 8:56 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague" itemprop="name">Zach Montague</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>The government asked a federal judge to extend the deadline it had set for Elon Musk and his cost-cutting team to produce internal documents pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request from a public interest legal group.

The order also seeks to sharply limit Paul, Weiss employees from entering government buildings, getting government jobs or receiving any money from federal contracts.</p><div><p>The move widened an assault by Mr. Trump on some of nation’s most prominent law firms. Legal experts have warned the aggressive campaign sets a dangerous precedent that threatens not just the ability of lawyers to do their jobs, but also the ability of private citizens to obtain lawyers to represent them.</p><p>The order said it was intended to end “government sponsorship of harmful activity” at Paul, Weiss and specifically punish one of its former lawyers, Mark F. Pomerantz.</p><p>Mr. Trump mentioned Mr. Pomerantz by name in an angry speech Friday at the Justice Department, where he complained about prosecutors and private lawyers who pursued cases against him, calling them “really bad people.” Mr. Trump, in the same speech, claimed he was ending the “weaponization” of the Justice Department, though his move against the firm showed he will continue using his power to exact retribution on his opponents.</p><p>Mr. Pomerantz had tried to build a criminal case against Mr. Trump several years ago when he worked at the Manhattan district attorney’s office. The White House announcement called Mr. Pomerantz “an unethical lawyer” who tried to “manufacture a prosecution against President Trump.”</p><p>The order also cited a case brought by a Paul, Weiss partner against pro-Trump rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the firm’s diversity policies as reasons for the restrictions.</p><p>A spokesperson for the firm said in a statement that Mr. Pomerantz retired from the firm in 2012 and had not been affiliated with it for years.</p><p>The spokesperson also noted a ruling this week from a federal judge who temporarily barred the Trump administration from carrying out many of the punishments detailed in an executive order against the Perkins Coie law firm. The rationale behind that Trump order, Judge Beryl A. Howell of Federal District Court in Washington said, sent “little chills down my spine.”</p><p>In the Perkins Coie order, Mr. Trump had sought to block the firm’s lawyers from entering government buildings, conferring with government officials or getting government jobs. During a hearing before Judge Howell this week, a lawyer representing Perkins Coie said the order, were it allowed to stand, would kill the firm.</p><p>Mr. Trump said he issued the order because of Perkins Coie’s role representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign and because of its connection to a dossier of unsubstantiated allegations against him.</p><p>Mr. Trump had previously signed a memo stripping security clearances from any lawyers at a different firm, Covington &amp; Burling, who were involved in representing Jack Smith, the former special counsel who pursued two separate indictments of the president in 2023.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNmZkZDgxMmYtOWRkNC01NDAzLThkNzItMjMyNTQ5MDdjYjlk"><div id="6fdd812f-9dd4-5403-8d72-23254907cb9d" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news#6fdd812f-9dd4-5403-8d72-23254907cb9d"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/devlin-barrett"><img alt="Devlin Barrett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/11/reader-center/author-devlin-barrett/author-devlin-barrett-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-15T00:25:35.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 14, 2025, 8:25 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/devlin-barrett" itemprop="name">Devlin Barrett</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from the Justice Department</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>President Trump opened a third attack against a private law firm on Friday, singling out Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison just days after a federal judge ruled such restrictions appeared to violate the Constitution.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, cosponsored the legislation, describing it in remarks on the floor as a fix to a “mistake” in the continuing resolution.</p><div><p>The bill has to pass the House and be signed into law by President Trump. Ms. Collins also said that it had been endorsed by Mr. Trump and by Representative Tom Cole, Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, suggesting the bill’s passage in the Republican-controlled House was likely.</p><p>Phil Mendelson, the chairman of the D.C. City Council, said in a statement that his office was working with the district’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, “to garner House support,” adding, “I am confident that we will find a solution to this problem that has been handed to us by Congress.”</p><p>In a departure from years of practice, the House resolution, written by Republicans, included the district’s budget in a spending freeze across federal agencies that would keep it at last year’s fiscal levels. D.C. officials repeatedly pointed out in news conferences and meetings with lawmakers that federal payments make up only a tiny fraction of the city’s budget, which relies mostly on locally raised taxes, fees and fines. They also emphasized that this fiscal year’s budget, which the city has been operating on for six months, was approved by Congress in previous resolutions.</p><p>To account for the freeze, the city would have been forced to make broad cuts and would most likely have had to lay off many city employees, including teachers and police officers.</p><p>The turmoil prompted by that prospect only reinforced the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/congress-washington-dc-shutdown-budget-cut.html" title="">district’s essential vulnerability</a>.</p><p>With more than 700,000 residents, the city is more populous than both Vermont and Wyoming, but has no voting representation in Congress, holds little control over its criminal justice system and must submit all local legislation for congressional approval.</p><p>This year, some Republican lawmakers and even Mr. Trump threatened to strip the city of what limited self-government it currently has by repealing the 52-year-old Home Rule Act, which allows residents to elect a mayor and a City Council. Such a move would put the district entirely under federal control.</p><p>Isabelle Taft<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington, D.C.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
