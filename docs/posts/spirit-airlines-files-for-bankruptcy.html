Spirit has also struggled to capitalize on the recovery from the pandemic because of intense competition, engine problems and other factors.</p><p>The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York. It also announced an agreement with bondholders to restructure its debts and raise money to help it operate during the bankruptcy process, which it expected to exit in the first quarter of next year.</p><p>The company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spirit-airlines-issues-open-letter-to-all-spirit-guests-302308341.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an open letter</a> to customers noting that fliers could “use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive, said in a statement that the arrangements announced on Monday represented a “a strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.”</p><p>The airline said in a court filing that it had 25,000 to 50,000 creditors, and total debt of about $9 billion at end of September.</p><p>Spirit began operations as a trucking company operating under a different name in 1964. It later became a tour operator and started offering flights in 1990. Two years later, it became Spirit Airlines.</p><p>But the modern incarnation of the company traces its roots to 2006, when Indigo Partners, a private equity fund, acquired a majority stake in Spirit. Under Indigo and the leadership of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/business/ben-baldanza-dead.html" title="">Ben Baldanza</a> — who spent a decade as Spirit’s chief executive and died this month — the airline sharply focused on lowering costs and selling cheap, bare-bones tickets.</p><p>Spirit’s business model made the airline the butt of late-night jokes, but also helped to reshape the industry. Travelers flocked to Spirit for its low fares, often overlooking concerns about the quality of its service. The airline earned consistent profits and other companies sought to emulate its approach. Today, most U.S. airlines offer some version of a no-frills ticket.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Spirit also became a powerful force in the industry. The airline’s presence in a city would often pressure others to lower fares. That phenomenon became a central part of the Justice Department’s successful lawsuit to prevent the JetBlue-Spirit merger, on the grounds that losing Spirit would harm consumers.</p><p>A round-trip flight on Spirit cost $140 on average, not including taxes, fees and add-ons, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm. That’s slightly higher than the $136 for Frontier Airlines and $134 for Allegiant Airlines, both rival budget carriers.</p><p>The bankruptcy filing comes after Spirit had spent months trying to renegotiate its debts. Companies, including many airlines, often emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases on stronger financial footing.</p><p>Airlines have filed for Chapter 11 more than 180 times in recent decades, according to data from Airlines for America, a trade group. Three of the industry’s largest companies — American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines — filed bankruptcy cases after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p><p>Those big airlines have profited from the pandemic recovery, in part by taking advantage of demand for premium and international travel. But Spirit and other budget airlines have had a more challenging time with rising costs and increased competition in large part because they did not fly to distant destinations or offer premium services like business class.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This summer was the busiest ever for air travel, according to Transportation Security Administration data. But low-fare carriers struggled because many of the popular destinations they serve were flooded with seats. The low-cost airlines have also faced rising competition from larger carriers selling “basic economy” tickets.</p><p>“Our larger, higher-cost brethren have introduced products and services that mirror what we currently offer,” Mr. Christie told investors in August.</p><p>Some of Spirit’s problems are also out of its control. The airline flies about 200 Airbus A320 planes, but a defect with the Pratt &amp; Whitney engines that power some of those aircraft means about one in 10 will not be flying this year. Spirit has said that it expects to start 2025 with 35 planes on the ground, rising to about 67.</p><p>The airline expects to receive $150 million to $200 million in compensation from Pratt &amp; Whitney. To <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/business/spirit-airlines-airbus-pilots.html" title="">cut costs</a> in recent months, Spirit had delayed delivery of new planes and furloughed pilots. It sold 23 planes last month and may sell more before emerging from bankruptcy, though about 80 percent of its planes are leased, according to Cirium.</p><p>Over the summer, Spirit tried to revive its fortunes by offering a premium services. In July, the airline announced that it would start <a href="https://ir.spirit.com/news-releases/news-details/2024/Go-Big-or-Go-Comfy-Spirit-Airlines-to-Offer-Unmatched-Value-with-New-Travel-Options-and-Transformed-Guest-Experience/default.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">selling four fare bundles</a>, which include different perks. The top offering includes a seat with extra legroom, priority boarding, refreshments and waived fees on bags. Another includes some of those perks and a guaranteed empty middle seat.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Niraj Chokshi writes about aviation, rail and other transportation industries.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/niraj-chokshi">More about Niraj Chokshi</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/spirit-airlines">Spirit Airlines</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/jetblue-airways-corporation">JetBlue Airways Corporation</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/pratt-whitney">Pratt &amp; Whitney</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/airbus-sas">Airbus S.A.S.</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Wall Street Goes to Riyadh: </strong>Are you an international business titan on the hunt for billions of dollars of Saudi oil cash? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/business/wall-street-saudi-arabia-oil-money.html">Prepare for “a mind game</a>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>What a Trump Victory Means for Tech:</strong> Another Trump presidency will be good for crypto and Elon Musk, but every big tech company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/technology/trump-musk-ai-crypto.html">may not benefit from a more hands-off approach to antitrust</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>T</strong><strong>he ‘Wall Street Girly’: </strong>Vivian Tu is one of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/business/vivian-tu-rich-af-personal-finance-tiktok-influencer.html">new wave of female influencers</a> who are using TikTok and Instagram to spread the message of personal finance to millennials and Generation Z.</p></li><li><p><strong>A ‘Recipe for Loneliness’: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/technology/personaltech/technology-loneliness.html">Technology and loneliness are interlinked</a>, researchers have found, stoked by the ways we interact with social media, text messaging and binge-watching.</p></li><li><p><strong>Convention Centers: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/business/convention-centers-revival.html">Cities are spending more than ever to land the biggest events</a>, but companies have long pulled back on spending for annual conferences and attendance has dwindled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Swindled Savings: </strong>Retirees were groomed by con artists posing as love interests, investment advisers or government officials. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/scam-con-artist-family-savings.html">Their kids were powerless to stop it</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
