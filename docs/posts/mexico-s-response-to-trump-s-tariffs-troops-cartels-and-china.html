But Mexico’s financial markets remain calm, reflecting expectations in the country’s business establishment that Ms. Sheinbaum can find a way to strike a deal.</p><p>“The way she’s been able to manage this crisis has been far superior than any other leader,” said Diego Marroquín Bitar, a scholar who specializes in North American trade at the Wilson Center, a Washington research group.</p><p>Mr. Trump praised Ms. Sheinbaum as a <a href="https://www.infobae.com/mexico/2025/02/20/trump-asegura-que-claudia-sheinbaum-es-una-mujer-maravillosa-replicara-campana-de-mexico-contra-las-drogas/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“marvelous woman”</a> after speaking with her in February.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico in the National Palace in Mexico City.

Skepticism of Mr. Trump’s xenophobic politics runs deep both in Mexican society and within Morena, Ms. Sheinbaum’s political party, which blends nationalist and leftist ideals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-us-mexico.html" title="">decades of integration</a>, Mexico relies on trade with the United States more than any other major economy. Tariffs, even if imposed briefly, could deal a blow, economists warn.</p><p>Mr. Trump is also threatening separate 25 percent tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports, which would also affect Mexico. And the Trump administration is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-tariffs.html" title="">formulating</a> additional “reciprocal” tariffs aimed at offsetting trade restrictions and matching the import duties charged by other countries.</p><p>The uncertainty over tariffs is already weighing on Mexico’s economy as companies put plans on hold. The central bank <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/mexican-central-bank-cuts-growth-forecast-amid-us-tariff-threat-ac6b9902" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slashed</a> its growth projection to 0.6 percent for this year from 1.2 percent.</p><p>Still, Mr. Trump’s repeated threats and subsequent pullback on those threats have nurtured hopes that tensions could ease. He initially vowed to impose the tariffs on his first day in office, but then backtracked twice.</p><p>Mexican negotiators are in Washington to meet with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, in a bid to reach a last-minute deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Here are three areas where Mexico is mobilizing to align with the Trump administration’s priorities.</p><h2 id="link-2d183011">Curbing Migration</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Mexican National Guard patrolling last month at the U.S.-Mexico border.
