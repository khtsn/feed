But Pittsburgh has not had a Republican mayor since one was appointed in 1932, so winning the Democratic primary has become tantamount to winning the mayoral election.</p><p>Mr. Gainey’s loss halted the momentum that progressives had enjoyed in this Democratic stronghold of a perpetual swing state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In recent years, Representative Summer Lee, a progressive who represents much of Pittsburgh in Congress, and Sara Innamorato, the Allegheny County executive who started her political career as a socialist candidate, vaulted into elected office. Riding the progressive wave with them was Mr. Gainey, a former state legislator who was elected mayor in 2021 with the backing of the powerful Service Employees International Union.</p><p>Mr. Gainey, the city’s first Black mayor, made affordable housing — and affordable living — the primary plank of his platform. But his gains in lifting the working class and poor were incremental, and his administration was plagued by persistent missteps.</p><p>Questions about the constant turnover in police leadership, accusations of fudged budget numbers and complaints about basic services like filling the city’s ubiquitous potholes overshadowed promising economic data and a decrease in crime.</p><p>Mr. O’Connor — whose father Bob was elected mayor in 2006 and died later that year from cancer — had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would get the city working again while it tried to rebuild a tax base devastated by the pandemic downturn in commercial real estate.</p><p>In his campaign, Mr. O’Connor, 40, pledged a more conciliatory approach toward powerful institutions like universities and health care companies and real estate developers. He had enjoyed a 3-to-1 fund-raising advantage over Mr. Gainey in recent months. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Gainey, by contrast, regularly chastised leaders of some of those organizations for not contributing more to address the city’s inequalities.</p><p>A peacemaking approach might well be required now, after a sharp-elbowed campaign between two candidates with few policy differences that split allegiances among city and county political leaders.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Across the U.S. With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters are exploring how America defines itself.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>North Carolina Supreme Court Race:</strong> The Republican challenger has embarked on an extraordinary effort to reverse his election loss that critics say is testing the boundaries of post-election litigation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/north-carolina-supreme-court-race-explainer.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Starbase, Texas:</strong> It has been a rough patch for Elon Musk, but he is about to realize a dream for SpaceX, its employees and for himself: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/elon-musk-town-starbase-texas.html">His own town on the southern tip of Texas</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rigging of the Texas Lottery:</strong> Texas lottery executives blessed a scheme that ensured one player would win a $95 million jackpot in 2023.
