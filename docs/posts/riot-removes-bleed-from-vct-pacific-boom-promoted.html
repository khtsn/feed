<p>Entering the competitive scene back in 2021, BLEED managed to hold its own within APAC&#39;s Challengers, but was never able to break into an international event. Despite not being among the initial batch of orgs accepted into the partnership leagues, BLEED fought through Challengers and secured the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1507/challengers-league-malaysia-singapore-split-2" target="_blank">Malaysia/Singapore</a> ticket to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1652/champions-tour-2023-pacific-ascension" target="_blank">Pacific Ascension 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Fighting through the group stage and making it all the way to the grand finals, BLEED became the first APAC team to secure a spot in the VCT by <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/239208/bleed-take-home-pacific-ascension-crown-in-3-0-over-scarz" target="_blank">sweeping</a> <span data-ref-id="2">

<p>Initially promised two years within the Pacific League, BLEED were slated for one more year of participation before being removed from the VCT. Riot has stated that their vacant slot will now be occupied by BOOM, while the Pacific League will continue with 12 teams this year.</p>

<p>BOOM are guaranteed this upcoming year, but according to the revised rule set regarding ascended teams, their performance within the VCT will most likely determine how long their stay lasts.</p>

They&#39;re playing for their livelihood, whether it means staying in Brazil or leaving, they&#39;ll be smart enough to take the better offer no matter where it is.</p>

		<p>i used to understand that feeling back in 2022, seeing the 2022 champs team fall apart cause of money was kind a sad, ive never judged sacy or pancada, im actually more off a sacy fan, for me it was a good feeling seeing sacy doing great with the sentinels roster, but aspas was different, he left loud searching for a team who could win a champs, now he left lev looking for the same thing, improvement, but all they see is betrayal, since sacy in 2022</p>

			<p>&#34;betrayal&#34; is actually part of the reason kangkang didnt look for another team, he said (atleast implied) that he could play in different regions (most probably pacific) but then said that if he did people would say he is a traitor to china</p>
<p>another part of the reason is because he is extremely patriotic </p>		</div>

	<div data-post-id="4178408">
		
		
		<p>I heard it through twitter and people on vlr.gg talking about how boom rejected trials for players on boom from rrq and talon and TS or t1 ( I don&#39;t remember now) and people were upset that the team was jailing the players. It seems that riot informed book beforehand that this decision to remove bleed was imminent and that&#39;s why they were holding the players.</p>

</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4181916">
		
		
		<p>Nope the owner said it was standard procedure to keep players after ascension in case something happens with the winning team and riot have to promote the team next in line, they also do the same last year even though they finished 4th</p>

			<p>Kinda reminds me of last year&#39;s incident with The Guard. I feel bad for the players themselves ngl, hopefully they can find their place to go. But it&#39;s just funny reading Leo Faria&#39;s tweet last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second solution we considered was promoting the runner-up M80, however, that would also create questionable precedents. The point of Ascension is to reward performance, and as great and talented as M80 is, <strong><em>qualifying a team that didn’t win the tournament defeats that purpose</em></strong>. Promotion is earned in-game, not out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://x.com/lhfaria/status/1696674542528389462" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">link</a> if you want to read it fully. Anyway, congrats to BOOM~!</p>		</div>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4178399">
		
		
		<p>While it is funny, I think it’s a different situation. At the time the promotion system was different, the current promotion system does include the possibility of 2 teams ascending naturally anyway</p>

		

		
		
	</div>
</div><div><div>
	<div data-post-id="4178452">
		
		
		<p>Oh, I didn&#39;t know about 2 teams ascending, where did they mention it? I&#39;m clueless about it.</p>

	<div data-post-id="4178598">
		
		
		<p>I already read that before but I don&#39;t quite get like which part is implicitly saying that 2 teams can ascend naturally from the ascension to league in the same year?</p>
