The trip came a day after Israel struck near a border crossing on a highway in central Lebanon that links Beirut and Damascus, the capital of Syria, saying that Hezbollah had used a tunnel there to transport weapons. Mr. Araghchi appears to be on a diplomatic tour, and in a news conference on Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/world/middleeast/iran-lebanon-gaza-ceasefire.html?smid=url-share" title="">in Beirut</a> conveyed Iran’s readiness to support a joint cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza.</p><p>President Biden, in a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room, said that Israel had not decided how to respond to Iran’s recent attacks but that if he were the Israeli leader, “I would be thinking about other alternatives” to attacking Iran’s oil facilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israel’s systematic targeting of the leaders of Hezbollah and Iran’s regional proxies appeared to reach deep into the country.

More than a dozen orders in August displaced as many as 250,000 people in Gaza, but Israeli military activity, including evacuation warnings, was largely focused on Lebanon in September.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Friday prayers in Tehran, a woman held up a photograph of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader killed recently by Israel. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Across the Red Sea, the United States Central Command said <a href="https://x.com/CENTCOM/status/1842269883226075153" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> on Friday that it struck 15 Houthi targets in Yemen, including “Houthi offensive military capabilities,” in an effort to secure international waterways.

Hezbollah began firing on northern Israel soon after the massacre of 1,200 Israelis, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah last fought an inconclusive war with Israel in 2006 and, given Iran’s support for Hezbollah, concern had built over time that they would soon be at war again.</p><p>Hamas said an Israeli airstrike near the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli killed a commander in its military wing. In a statement, the military wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, identified the commander as Saeed Ali and said the strike hit his home. His wife and two daughters were also killed, the statement said. The Israeli military didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The State Department said it was aware of and “alarmed” about reports of the death in Lebanon of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/05/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon#michigan-father-lebanon-airstrike" title="">Kamel Ahmad Jawad</a>, an American citizen.
