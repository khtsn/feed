Miller, who was convicted in the 1999 murders of three men he believed were spreading rumors about him, is scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Central time in Atmore, Ala.</p><p>In January, the state carried out what was described as the first nitrogen execution anywhere in the world, and other states have said they are looking into doing so as well as they continue to experience problems obtaining lethal injection drugs.</p><p>Several witnesses to that execution said that the prisoner, Kenneth Smith, shook violently as the nitrogen gas was administered and then writhed before his body eventually stopped moving. Witnesses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/us/alabama-nitrogen-execution-kenneth-smith-witnesses.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> that the gurney had shaken in the execution chamber and that Mr. Smith had appeared to be gasping for air.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the state’s attorney general, Steve Marshall, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/us/alabama-execution-kenneth-smith-nitrogen.html" title="">hailed the execution</a>, calling it “textbook” and saying that Alabama had become a pioneer that other states could follow. “Alabama has done it, and now so can you,” he said.</p><p>Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas, is not harmful in itself and makes up about 78 percent of the air. But when it is used in an execution, a prisoner is strapped to a gurney and a mask is placed over the head, after which a stream of pure nitrogen gas, absent life-sustaining oxygen, produces a fatal but supposedly painless form of suffocation known as nitrogen hypoxia. The method <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/nitrogen-execution-alabama-kenneth-smith.html" title="">has been used</a> in some medically assisted suicides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deanna Smith, wife of Kenneth Smith, is comforted by Jeff Hood following the execution of Mr. Smith in January in Atmore, Alabama.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Edmund D. Fountain for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Lawyers for the state said Mr. Smith might have moved on the gurney during the execution in January because he tried to hold his breath once the nitrogen had begun flowing.</p><p>If Thursday’s execution moves forward, it would be the second time that the state has tried to carry out the death penalty for Mr. Miller, 59. In September 2022, Mr. Miller fought his planned execution by lethal injection, arguing in court that he had opted for a nitrogen execution but that the state had lost his request.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The U.S. Supreme Court sided with the state, allowing the lethal injection to proceed, and Mr. Miller was taken to the execution chamber. Workers spent more than an hour unsuccessfully trying to insert an intravenous line into his veins, and the execution was called off sometime before midnight, when his death warrant expired.</p><p>Later that year, following several problems with executions, Alabama’s governor, Kay Ivey, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/us/alabama-executions-lethal-injection.html" title="">temporarily stopped</a> all executions in the state and called for the prison system to review its procedures. A handful of changes were made, including lengthening by 12 hours the window during which officials can carry out death warrants. Executions resumed in 2023.</p><p>Death penalty opponents have warned of a litany of potential problems with using nitrogen gas, including the possibility that the prisoner could vomit under the mask and that the mask’s seal could be broken, diluting the nitrogen and prolonging the person’s suffering.</p><p>Maya Foa, an executive director of Reprieve US, a nonprofit that targets human rights issues, said Alabama’s decision to try to execute Mr. Miller a second time was part of a long, recent history of problematic attempts to carry out the death penalty, both by lethal injection and nitrogen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alan E.

Nine more are scheduled to die in six states before the end of the year, <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/upcoming-executions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Death Penalty Information Center</a>. Oklahoma has scheduled the execution on Thursday of Emmanuel Littlejohn, who was convicted in a 1992 convenience store robbery in which the store owner was fatally shot. Executions have been on a general decline since 1999, when a modern peak of 98 were carried out, and death sentences have dropped dramatically as well.</p><p>This month so far, three people have been executed in three states. South Carolina carried out the state’s first execution in more than a decade last week, with a lethal injection to Freddie Owens. And Missouri and Texas each executed a person on Tuesday.</p><p>This week’s execution of Marcellus Williams in Missouri took place <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/marcellus-williams-execution-missouri.html" title="">over the objections of the local prosecutor’s office</a> that had convicted him of murder. The prosecutor there had argued in recent months that Mr. Williams could be innocent and that his prosecution had been mishandled.</p><p>In Alabama, Mr. Miller’s lawyers argued in court earlier this year that it was “difficult to overstate the mental and physical anguish” that he had endured during the failed attempt in 2022. They said men in scrubs had tried unsuccessfully to insert intravenous lines in his arms, his hands and one of his feet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>They asked in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.almd.82690/gov.uscourts.almd.82690.1.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that lawsuit</a> that a medical professional be present during the nitrogen execution and hold the mask on Mr. Miller’s face. It is not known whether the state agreed to that, as a settlement <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.almd.82690/gov.uscourts.almd.82690.80.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reached</a> last month was confidential.</p><p>Mr. Miller was convicted in the murders of three men on Aug. 5, 1999, at two Alabama businesses where he had worked, a plumbing company and a warehouse operation that sold oxygen canisters. He was 34 at the time of the shootings. The victims were Lee Holdbrooks, 32; Christopher Yancey, 28; and Terry Jarvis, 39.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-13"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national stories across the United States with a focus on criminal justice.
