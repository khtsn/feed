    <h1>NYC Fire Department Chief to Plead Guilty to Bribery Charge, U.S. Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A former chief of the New York Fire Department, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/nyregion/nyc-fdny-bribery-arrest.html" title="">who was arrested earlier this month</a> and accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to speed up the fire-safety approval process, has agreed to plead guilty to one count of bribery conspiracy, federal prosecutors said on Monday.</p><p>The former chief, Brian E. Cordasco, had been involved in plea negotiations with the government before deciding to plead guilty, according to a letter federal prosecutors sent on Monday to Judge Lewis J. Liman of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Prosecutors hoped to schedule a plea hearing for early October.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Cordasco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.</p><p>Mr. Cordasco and Anthony M. Saccavino, another retired chief who was also arrested in September, were responsible for overseeing fire safety approvals of large-scale building projects. From 2021 to 2023, the former chiefs solicited and received bribes that involved 30 different projects citywide, according to the six-count indictment.</p><p>The retired fire chiefs were both charged with bribery and bribery conspiracy; honest services wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy; and making false statements, including to the F.B.I. during interviews in February. Mr. Saccavino has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p></div></div>
