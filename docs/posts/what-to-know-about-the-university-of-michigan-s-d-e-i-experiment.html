    <h1>What to Know About the University of Michigan’s D.E.I. Experiment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The number of employees who work in D.E.I.-related offices or have “diversity,” “equity” or “inclusion” in their job titles reached 241 last year, according to an analysis by Mark J. Perry, an emeritus professor of finance at the university’s Flint campus.</p><h2 id="link-2311bb43">Michigan has struggled to improve Black enrollment — and students overall feel less included, not more.</h2><p>The percentage of Black students, currently around 5 percent, remained largely stagnant as Michigan’s overall enrollment rose — and in a state where 14 percent of residents are Black. In a survey released in late 2022, students and faculty members across the board reported a less positive campus climate than at the program’s start and less of a sense of belonging.</p><p>Students were less likely to interact with people of a different race or religion or with different politics — the exact kind of engagement D.E.I. programs, in theory, are meant to foster.</p><h2 id="link-13e77054">While its peers reconsider aspects of D.E.I., Michigan has doubled down.</h2><p>This year, both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced they would no longer require job candidates to submit diversity statements, or explanations of the candidate’s commitment to D.E.I. Such “compelled statements,” M.I.T.’s president said, “impinge on freedom of expression.” But at Michigan, a faculty committee this summer privately recommended that the school continue using such statements,” which are currently required by most of Michigan’s colleges and schools.</p><h2 id="link-110710b3">D.E.I. at Michigan has helped fuel a culture of grievance.</h2><p>Instead of improving students’ ability to engage with one another across their differences, Michigan’s D.E.I. expansion has coincided with an explosion in campus conflict over race and gender. Everyday campus complaints and academic disagreements are now cast as crises of inclusion and harm.</p></div></div>
