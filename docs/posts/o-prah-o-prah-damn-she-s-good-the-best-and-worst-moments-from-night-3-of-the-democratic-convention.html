</div></section></div><div><div><p>Welcome to Opinion’s commentary for Night 3 of the Democratic National Convention. In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rate the evening on a scale of 0 to 10: 0 means the night was a disaster for Kamala Harris; 10 means it could lead to a big polling bump. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought of the event, which included speeches by Oprah Winfrey, Josh Shapiro, Bill Clinton and Tim Walz.</p><h2 id="link-1e36b0fa">Best Moment</h2><p><strong>Kristen Soltis Anderson, contributing Opinion writer </strong>Younger voters may not realize how powerful Oprah Winfrey is as a voice. I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/opinion/trump-oprah-polls.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" title="">wrote</a> about this in May, and her speech tonight targeted precisely the voters both sides hope to persuade this year.</p><p><strong>Binyamin Appelbaum, member of the editorial board </strong>Oprah.</p><p><strong>Charles M. Blow, Times columnist</strong> Tim Walz’s intense, locker-room-pep-talk-style acceptance speech.</p><p><strong>David Brooks, Times columnist </strong>First, the tone of lavish American patriotism that permeated the evening. But my favorite quirky moment was when Gus Walz burst into tears after his dad gave him a shout-out, telling his neighbors, “That’s my dad!” Walz is one relatable American.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Jane Coaston, contributing Opinion writer </strong>Thousands of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/hersh-goldberg-polin-gaza-hostage.html" title="">chanting</a> “Bring them home,” as the parents of one of the hostages in Gaza stood before them.</p><p><strong>Michelle Cottle, political writer for Opinion </strong>O-prah! O-prah! O-prah! Damn, she’s good.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Liam Donovan, Republican strategist </strong>Walz was on brand, and Oprah brought the star power, but the methodical buildup of Kamala Harris’s record as a tough border-state prosecutor is a reminder of what this race will boil down to when the speeches fade.</p><p><strong>Michelle Goldberg, Times columnist </strong>Walz made me wish I understood football metaphors.</p><p><strong>Matt Labash, author of the newsletter Slack Tide </strong>Tonight’s bell ringer wasn’t produced by Democrats, but Republicans — the Jan. 6 lowlights reel — complete with Capitol Police getting viciously attacked. A keen reminder that Harris’s most appealing quality is that she’s not Donald Trump, and this election isn’t just about “joy,” but also betrayal: of morality, of democracy, of us.</p><h2 id="link-551afe84">Worst Moment</h2><p><strong>Anderson </strong>I applaud Walz for speaking about his family’s infertility journey, and I am even willing to grant some latitude about being imprecise on the specifics of your own treatment. But since Walz did not use I.V.F. but a different fertility treatment, I.U.I., it hits a sour note with me to falsely imply many Republicans want to ban something they very much <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/tim-walz-fertility-pregnancy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" title="">do not want to ban</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Appelbaum </strong>When Kenan Thompson of “Saturday Night Live” had an Ordinary American zoom into the convention hall during his riff about Project 2025. The guy was talking, but he was on mute. Relatable.</p><p><strong>Blow </strong>Lateefah Simon, an activist running for the U.S. House in California’s 12th district, crossed the line from passion to theatrics in her speech.</p><p><strong>Brooks </strong>The Democrats are not making a mistake by talking about abortion, obviously, but Democrats are making a big mistake by not talking more about how to create a growing economy, which is the No. 1 issue on voters’ minds. This was another night when they seemed to have nothing to say about it.</p><p><strong>Coaston </strong>In some ways the intense celebrity at the Democratic convention can feel distracting (though if Trump could have gotten Oprah to speak at the Republican convention, he would have had her give his closing address).</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Cottle </strong>Enough already with the “Lock him up!” chants.</p><p><strong>Donovan </strong>An uneven night where Democrats tried some ambitious things that didn’t always land, which doubles as a good descriptor of Bill Clinton’s speech. He may still be (barely) younger than Trump, but his garrulous style hits differently now that the oratory fastball is long gone.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Goldberg </strong>My mom texted me sleepy emojis and the words, “Clinton needs to get off the stage.” But he kept going.</p><p><strong>Labash </strong>Audience reaction seemed very muted for the introduction of Clinton, once a conquering hero. Crowd cutaways showed many not applauding at all. They seemed to feel conflicted about his legacy. Welcome to the club.</p><h2 id="link-1fcce74e">What Else Caught Your Eye?</h2><p><strong>Anderson </strong>It’s probably not worth belaboring at this point, but putting the keynote speakers onstage past prime time no longer seems to be accidental. Democratic officials must just assume that this convention will be consumed via clips after the fact.</p><p><strong>Appelbaum </strong>Amanda Gorman may have been the only speaker billed as a poet, but there were plenty of verbal pyrotechnics — quite a contrast with a Republican convention whose most iconic moment came when a muscle man ripped his shirt in half and started growling.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Blow </strong>He is clearly growing frailer, but Clinton is still the dean of “putting the hay down where the goats can get it,” of explaining the complex in common parlance.</p><p><strong>Brooks </strong>On Tuesday night, Angela Alsobrooks, a U.S. Senate candidate in Maryland, mentioned that Trump has had us trapped since 2015. He’s even trapped our imaginations, she said, and it has created a tense, constricted emotional tone among many Democrats. It’s amazing to me how much that weight has been lifted from this party, night after night. We’ll see if it matches the tone of the country.</p><p><strong>Coaston </strong>Never in my life did I think that the Democratic convention would attempt to claim “freedom, faith and football.” Nor did I think it would actually be fairly successful.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p><strong>Cottle </strong>It was hard not to be charmed by the gaggle of middle-aged guys in high school football jerseys who piled onto the stage to pay tribute to their former coach turned V.P. pick. Doing goofy dads everywhere proud. Go Scarlets!</p></div><div><div><p><strong>Donovan </strong>Just put the franchise tag on Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, right now. One way or another, the man will be on the next open Democratic ticket.</p><p><strong>Goldberg </strong>A whole generation of ambitious Democratic men have learned to speak like Barack Obama, but Josh Shapiro takes it too far.</p><p><strong>Labash </strong>I know he’s a legend — it says so right in his name. But is John Legend contractually obligated to play <em>every single</em> Democratic gathering? Also, poor Prince has been dead since 2016. They didn’t need to bring Legend back to murder him with a wedding-singer impression.</p></div></div><div></div><div><div><p>David Brooks, Charles M.
