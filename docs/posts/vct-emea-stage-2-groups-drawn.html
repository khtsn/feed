		<p>The groups for VCT EMEA have been rearranged ahead of Stage 2. Three pairs of teams from Group Alpha and Group Omega switched sides, switching up the groups for league play to end the regional season. Unlike in 2024, group stage results for each stage are now independent from one another, meaning teams get a clean slate in their hopes of qualifying for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions 2025</a> through Stage 2.</p>

<p>The groups are as follows:</p>









<p>For the draw, teams were placed into three different pools, with the first and second seed teams in the first pool, the third and fourth seed teams in the second pool, and the fifth and sixth seed teams in the third pool. One pairing was selected from each pool, which designated which pair switched groups. The second seed was picked from the first pool, meaning Stage 1 champions FNATIC and BBL Esports switch groups. The third seed was picked from the second pool, meaning Natus Vincere and FUT Esports switch groups. Finally, the sixth seed was picked from the third pool, meaning Apeks and Gentle Mates switch.</p>

<p>Seedings for the draw were based purely on group stage results, and the newly mixed groups make for some fun matchups. While the Stage 1 grand finalists are split into separate groups, Group Alpha is now stacked with the likes of Team Heretics, BBL Esports, FUT Esports, and Team Vitality. The draw also preserved the region&#39;s Turkish derby between FUT and BBL. Meanwhile, Group Omega is headlined by Team Liquid and FNATIC, two of the region&#39;s three Masters Toronto representatives.</p>

<p>Stage 2 is set to begin in July.</p>
