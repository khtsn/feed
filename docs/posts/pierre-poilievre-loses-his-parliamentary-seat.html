The Conservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre, conceded the election, but after 1 a.m. Eastern time it was still unclear whether he had retained the seat in Parliament he has held for 20 years. Mr. Carney made an acceptance speech, but it was still not known whether he would be forming a majority or minority government.</p><div><p>Preliminary results were likely to be available overnight Tuesday. A minority government would require support from other parties to pass legislation and would be weaker and less stable than a majority.</p><p>But the voters’ decision sealed a stunning reversal for the Liberal Party that just months ago seemed all but certain to lose to the Conservative Party. Mr. Carney has been prime minister since March, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepped down.</p><p>The centerpiece of Mr. Carney’s acceptance speech early Tuesday morning was Canada’s response to Mr. Trump’s policies.</p><p>“As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water,” he said. “President Trump is trying to break us so he can own us. That will never happen.” He warned Canadians that the road ahead would be difficult and might require sacrifices.</p><p>When Mr. Poilievre conceded early Tuesday morning, he said that he would remain as party leader. The Conservative caucus can remove him from the post, which it did to the party’s two previous leaders after it failed to form the government.</p><p>The election has been remarkable in many ways, with candidates and many voters describing it as the most important vote in their lifetimes.</p><p>It has been dominated by Mr. Trump and his relentless focus on Canada, America’s closest ally and trading partner. Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, pushing the country toward a recession, and repeatedly threatened to annex it as the 51st state. Even as Canadians were heading to the polls on Monday morning, he repeated that desire, arguing on social media that it would bring economic and military benefits.</p><p>Mr. Carney, 60, a seasoned economist and policymaker who promoted himself as the anti-Trump candidate and centered his campaign on dealing with the United States, ultimately benefited from the American president&#39;s actions.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre, 45, and the Conservatives had been dominating polls for years, building a platform against the Liberals and Mr. Trudeau around the argument that they had dragged Canada into prolonged economic malaise.</p><p>But they watched their double-digit lead rapidly evaporate after Mr. Trump’s aggressiveness toward Canada and Mr. Trudeau’s resignation.</p><p>Canadians heading to the polls were preoccupied both with the country’s relationship with its neighbor to the south and with the state of the economy at home. Affordability worries, primarily over housing, were top of mind, opinion surveys conducted before the election showed.</p><p>But Canada’s choice on Monday also came as a kind of referendum against Mr. Trump and the way he has been treating America’s allies and its trading partners.</p><p>It’s the second major international election since Mr. Trump came to power, after Germany, and Canada’s handling of the rupture in the relationship with the United States is being closely watched around the world.</p><p>The election also highlighted that Mr. Trump’s brand of conservative politics can turn toxic for conservatives elsewhere if they are seen as being too aligned with his ideological and rhetorical style. Mr. Poilievre, who railed against “radical woke ideology,” pledged to defund Canada’s national broadcaster and said he would cut foreign aid, seemed to have lost centrist voters, pre-election polls suggested.</p><p>For Mr. Carney, Monday’s victory marked an astonishing moment in his rapid rise in Canada’s political establishment since entering the race to replace Mr. Trudeau in January.</p><p>A political novice but policy-making veteran, Mr. Carney conveyed a measured, serious tone and defiance toward Mr. Trump’s aggressive overtures, helping to sway voters who had been contemplating supporting the Conservatives, according to polls and some individual voters. And his politics as a pragmatist and a centrist seemed to better align with Canada’s mood after a decade of Mr. Trudeau’s progressive agenda.</p><p>The road ahead for Mr. Carney and his new government will be hard. For starters, he will need to engage with Mr. Trump and his unpredictable attitude toward Canada and discuss fraught issues, including trade and security.</p><p>And he will need to show voters that his economic policy credentials can truly be put to use to improve Canada’s slow economic growth and persistently high unemployment.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="70" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Y5Y2E2NTQ3LTY4YmQtNTZjOS1hZDcxLWU1YjNjY2U2Y2ZhOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/28/world/canada-election#pierre-poilievre-loses-his-parliamentary-seat-the-cbc-says" data-source-id="100000010128371"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vjosa-isai"><img alt="Vjosa Isai" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-29T09:10:39.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 29, 2025, 5:10 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Conservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre, during a campaign rally this month in Nisku, Alberta.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amber Bracken for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, was unseated as the parliamentary representative of his Ottawa district in a stunning upset that could put his leadership of the party in question.</p><p>Mr. Poilievre was first elected in 2004 as the member of Parliament representing Carleton, a largely rural district bordering parts of the Ottawa River.

When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepped down, one of Mr. Carney’s first moves was to scrap one of his predecessor’s least popular policies, a tax on fuel that included gasoline at the pump and was based on emissions intensity.</p><p>Even though most Canadians got much of that money back in rebate checks, Mr. Carney called the policy poorly understood and thus “too divisive.”</p><p>That move, coupled with what many see as similarities between his Conservative Party opponent, Pierre Poilievre, and Mr. Trump, have helped Mr. Carney as he’s risen in the polls.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzgxZGFjM2M1LTZjYzYtNTZjOS04ZTZiLWM5YTgxNWVmZjZjMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/28/world/canada-election#china-experience-was-once-a-plus-in-canadas-election-its-a-liability" data-source-id="100000010135177"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matina-stevis-gridneff"><img alt="Matina Stevis-Gridneff" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/alexandra-stevenson"><img alt="Alexandra Stevenson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-alexandra-stevenson/author-alexandra-stevenson-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-alexandra-stevenson/author-alexandra-stevenson-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-alexandra-stevenson/author-alexandra-stevenson-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-28T23:00:03.682Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 28, 2025, 7:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Carney with Xi Jinping of China during G20 meetings in Hangzhou, China, in 2016.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bernd von Jutrczenka/picture alliance, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Asked to name the biggest threat to Canada’s security during an election debate, Mark Carney, the country’s prime minister and Liberal Party leader running to win a full term, gave a surprising answer: “China.”</p><p>Analysts saw it as an attempt to distance himself from the country amid heightened scrutiny on his own past work there.</p><div><p>Mr. Carney, a former central banker and business executive, dealt with the Chinese establishment in his recent private-sector roles for companies with investments in China.</p><p>But what was once an asset — experience working with a rising global power — has become a political liability in Monday’s national elections.</p><p>Mr. Carney and the Liberals have come under criticism for supporting a parliamentary candidate with connections to groups representing China’s Communist Party in Canada.

But as voters cast their ballots on Monday, the issue has notably lost traction behind pressing concerns over the country’s economy and President Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/world/canada/canada-immigration-labor.html" title="">government had turbocharged immigration</a> in a bid to address Canada’s labor shortage, announcing in November 2022 that the government planned to bring in almost 1.5 million immigrants between 2023 and 2025.</p><div><p>But when those newcomers arrived and settled mostly in dense, urban areas, Canadians blamed the rising immigration levels for growing pressure on housing costs and social services like health care.</p><p>As Mr. Trudeau’s popularity dropped, his unpopular policy to accelerate immigration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/world/canada/canada-immigration-policy.html" title="">dramatically undone</a>. Several ministers announced their resignations when it appeared that Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals could not recover from the political damage of policies that included immigration.</p><p>As Canada rolled back its pathways for newcomers, Marc Miller, the last immigration minister under Mr. Trudeau, also linked societal strains to the number of newcomers in explaining the government’s decisions to scale back admissions.</p><p>The moment represented a sharp change in tone for Canada.</p><p>“For the longest time, immigration had always been lauded as a net benefit to the Canadian economy,” said Antje Ellermann, a director at the Center for Migration Studies at the University of British Columbia. “That really was a mantra, and policymakers were very careful not to talk about any potential costs of immigration.”</p><p>Then somewhat overnight, after Mr. Trump began to amplify his threats to Canada’s economy, the issue of immigration — which had partially caused the Liberals’ downfall — faded into the background.</p><p>“If it hadn’t been for Trump, we would see immigration as a quite salient issue in this campaign,” Ms. Ellermann said.</p><p>Polls have shown that Canadians think the country is accepting more immigrants than it should, an attitude that has prevailed, even among many of the newcomers.</p><p>“A lot of immigrants in Canada also feel there are too many immigrants,” said Jack Jedwab, chief executive of the Association for Canada Studies, a research group, and the Metropolis Institute, a think tank focused on migration.</p><p>Mr. Jedwab’s recent analysis, based on surveys conducted by the firm Leger, showed higher support for Liberals among immigrants whose first language is neither English nor French. But that is a small minority in Canada.</p><p>“Our demographics have evolved so much that it’s hard to really refer to an ‘immigrant vote,’” said Mr. Jedwab, adding that immigrants tend to vote based on regional trends.</p><p>As much is clear in Brampton, Ontario, a suburban city west of Toronto where more than half of residents are South Asian. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre focused an April 9 campaign rally on crime control, knowing the city’s residents faced rampant home invasions, car thefts and extortion rackets that targeted immigrants.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzRlY2I1NmRkLTg4ZWYtNTFkNC05NGE5LWEyNDYxY2U0Y2UwZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/28/world/canada-election#in-canadas-fight-with-trump-danielle-smith-is-playing-the-good-cop" data-source-id="100000010116103"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matina-stevis-gridneff"><img alt="Matina Stevis-Gridneff" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/reader-center/author-matina-stevis-gridneff/author-matina-stevis-gridneff-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-04-28T22:00:04.235Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">April 28, 2025, 6:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, has riled Canadians across the country by speaking admiringly of President Trump, even as the American administration menaces Canada.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amber Bracken for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>As Canada barrels through one of the stormiest periods in its history, there’s a name that’s not on the ballot but is on people’s minds: Danielle Smith.</p><p>Ms. Smith, the premier of Alberta, the Western province often called the Texas of Canada because of its oil, ranches and conservative politics, is referred to as “divisive” by supporters and critics alike: People love her, people hate her, people love to hate her.</p><div><p>An unapologetic MAGA-aligned conservative, she has riled Canadians across the country by speaking admiringly of President Trump and focusing on her province’s fortunes, particularly its oil exports, even as the U.S. administration menaces Canada.</p><p>Ms. Smith, 54, has been premier for the past two and a half years, having spent the past two decades dipping in and out of politics.</p><p>“I keep getting fired,” she chuckled in an interview with The New York Times in Calgary, Alberta, in February.</p><p>She has also worked as an economist, a lobbyist and a radio host of a popular call-in show in which she honed her folksy, affable, but sharply ideological raconteur style.</p><p>She’s the closest thing Canada’s conservative movement has to a MAGA ally — and has the Mar-a-Lago <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEu_cTSSZP7/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photograph</a> with Mr. Trump to prove it.</p><p>As Mr. Trump started to say he wanted to make Canada the 51st state, before his inauguration, Ms. Smith visited him in Florida.</p><p>Even before Mr. Trump’s re-election, Ms. Smith had been key in shaping the evolution of Canada’s broader conservative movement.
