Many food-processing and manufacturing companies outsource cleaning and other jobs to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/us/immigration-undocumented-workers-jobs.html" title="">third-party staffing firms,</a> which technically employ the workers and shield companies from any violations.</p><p>Federal investigators found that children had been working at a Perdue plant on Virginia’s Eastern Shore as far back as 2020. The children, who had been hired by a staffing firm, worked late hours and performed dangerous tasks with electric knives and hot sealing tools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Perdue agreed to pay $4 million in restitution to the children and to organizations including Kids in Need of Defense, a national nonprofit organization that provides lawyers to young migrants who come to the country alone. Perdue, one of the country’s largest poultry processors, will also pay a $150,000 civil penalty.</p><p>In a statement, Perdue said it strongly disagreed that it should be held liable for the child labor violations but wanted to avoid a prolonged dispute with the Labor Department.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
