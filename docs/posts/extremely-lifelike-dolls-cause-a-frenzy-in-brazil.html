    <h1>Extremely Lifelike Dolls Cause a Frenzy in Brazil</h1>

She calls it “one of the busiest and scariest days for me.”</p><p>She grabs onesies, a bottle and medical documents and tucks him in the back of a car. At the hospital, he is weighed and lies in a bed, where she removes his pacifier, bottle-feeds him and wipes a few drops of formula from his cheek.</p><p>But this was not an actual medical emergency — it was role-playing by a content creator — and the baby was not a real baby. It was a shockingly lifelike doll, called a reborn doll, which is handcrafted to look and feel like a baby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The video, which received more than <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yas_reborn/video/7498459573158792503" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">16 million views</a> on TikTok, is part of a social media craze that has turned into a cultural and political flashpoint in Brazil. Widely circulated videos show women taking the hyperrealistic dolls to the park in strollers, celebrating their birthdays with cake and songs, and simulating childbirth. (A select few even simulate the dolls’ having a nosebleed or potty training.)</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/multimedia/00xp-reborndolls-khwc/00xp-reborndolls-khwc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/multimedia/00xp-reborndolls-khwc/00xp-reborndolls-khwc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/multimedia/00xp-reborndolls-khwc/00xp-reborndolls-khwc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A young woman in a green dress sits on a picnic blanket on the grass with five lifelike dolls." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/multimedia/00xp-reborndolls-khwc/00xp-reborndolls-khwc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/multimedia/00xp-reborndolls-khwc/00xp-reborndolls-khwc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/multimedia/00xp-reborndolls-khwc/00xp-reborndolls-khwc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/08/multimedia/00xp-reborndolls-khwc/00xp-reborndolls-khwc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/e4a6708c-9bb4-5a80-96c3-ed4640eac09d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The YouTuber Gabi Matos with her collection of dolls in Campinas, Brazil, in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nelson Almeida/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The ones I like the most are the newborns,” said Juliana Drusz Magri, 36, who lives in Curitiba, the capital of the Brazilian state of Paraná, and works in human resources. She said she began collecting the dolls in 2018 and now has 22.</p><p>“The world of make-believe is an escape valve for me,” she said. “And, no, I don’t treat it like a real baby.”</p><p>The dolls have flooded into pop culture. They were featured this month in <a href="https://x.com/tvglobo/status/1930430169816146129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1930430169816146129%7Ctwgr%5Eb5bc3068facc1457e268f6b0ac1dfe98e29a848c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metropoles.com%2Fentretenimento%2Ftelevisao%2Fglobo-e-detonada-apos-parto-de-bebe-reborn-em-vale-tudo-virou-circo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an episode</a> of “Vale Tudo,” a prime-time telenovela, and in a rap song trending on social media about a gang that walks down the street “kicking reborn dolls.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Drusz caring for one of her dolls at home last week.

His colleague Joana Darc also voiced concern.</p><p>“You just can’t force a doctor in a hospital, for example, to treat a reborn doll as if it were a child, which is a living being,” she said on the floor. “You can’t force a teacher to accept a child in a day care center because the person wants the reborn doll to study.”</p><p>She asked where it would end: with people taking “reborn pets” to the veterinarian to be neutered?</p><p>In what looked like a bit of trolling, the official social media account of Curitiba <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJroJi_R2PI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned the “mothers”</a> of reborn dolls not to sit in the yellow seats on city buses reserved for pregnant women. “Reborns are cute, but they don’t guarantee a place in the yellow seat, OK?” the post read.</p><p>In defense of the dolls, the Rio de Janeiro City Council approved <a href="https://mail.camara.rj.gov.br/APL/Legislativos/scpro2124.nsf/a6cd246684502db90325863200569384/cd53629794dd7a9b03258979006725b1?OpenDocument" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a proposal</a> to make Sept. 4 Reborn Stork Day, a holiday honoring the artisans who make the dolls. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes, vetoed the proposal. “With all due respect to those interested, this isn’t happening,” he wrote on <a href="https://x.com/eduardopaes/status/1929516318375456821" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>.</p><p>At least 30 bills have been filed in legislative houses across the country to bar the dolls from receiving services in public health facilities, according to public records. But there appears to have been just one documented case of a woman with a psychiatric disorder showing up at a hospital to seek treatment for her doll, only to be turned away at the entrance, <a href="https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2025/05/22/direita-politicas-bebe-reborn-projetos-nao-problema.htm?utm_source=%28direct%29&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=dolly-folly" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the news outlet UOL reported</a>. Most of the bills have been introduced by members of right-wing parties.</p><p>Vivi Louhrinci, 30, an actress from Curitiba, has been making reborn dolls since 2020, including some for the Brazilian productions of “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGjVIOGxuZZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wicked</a>” and “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI2RA4oR4KW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matilda</a>.”</p><p>“My life has turned into chaos with this boom,” she said, referring to the frenzy around the dolls. “It has been a good exposure in this sense, but it is an exposure that is causing so much stress.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-10"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><figure data-slug="00xp-reborndolls-grid-1"><div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><figcaption>Vivi Louhrinci, an actress and artist who has been creating reborn dolls since 2020, delicately paints veins and roots individual strands of mohair — a fiber made from alpaca and wool — to create a doll’s hair.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Camila Infanger, a doctoral candidate in political science at the University of São Paulo, said there had been a noticeable difference in the response to hobbies associated with women and those associated with men.</p><p>“Because women are doing it and women are the principal actors in this, it’s been stigmatized differently,” she said, adding that the backlash was “just another way to regulate women’s lives.”</p><p>The dolls have been around <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/motherhood-reborn-and-everlasting/" title="">since the 1990s</a>, when people started stripping the paint and hair off store-bought vinyl dolls and painstakingly reworking them to be more lifelike. And the interest in them is not limited to Brazil.</p><p>Dave Stack of Cleveland, the owner of Reborns, an online marketplace for reborn dolls, said he had seen a “slow and steady increase” in sales since he started the site in 2012. He now sells 40 to 60 dolls per day, up from about 10 per day five years ago, according to <a href="https://www.reborns.com/stats/orders.cgi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his website</a>.</p><p>Most cost around $200 to $250 and are made of vinyl, while a few limited-edition dolls made of softer silicone have sold for more than $4,000, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Reborn dolls for sale in Duque de Caxias and Campinas, Brazil, in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mauro Pimentel/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The dolls have been around since the 1990s, when people started stripping the paint and hair off store-bought vinyl dolls and painstakingly reworking them to be more lifelike.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andre Penner/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A small percentage of the dolls are purchased by mothers who are grieving the loss of a child, Mr. Stack said. Others have been bought by memory-care facilities, lawyers who use them for courtroom re-enactments and people making movies and television shows. But most buyers are “just people who love babies,” he said.</p><p>Some popular videos made by content creators show the dolls <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNtliaJCkQ0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">getting a bloody nose</a>, going on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxlpU5j9_dE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first outing to Target</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv-3M7XDWgA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">throwing up in the car</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Louhrinci holding a work in progress.

But they don’t see it as a baby doll. They see it as a baby.”</p><p>Ms. Drusz, the collector from Curitiba, called the dolls “a calming, fun, I would even say innocent hobby,” and said she was frustrated with being judged for her interest in them.</p><p>“I hope that after all this is over, we can continue our collections in peace and do what we like without being labeled,” she said. “I think that reborn dolls are an art, and art deserves to be appreciated.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Women gathered with their reborn dolls in a park in São Paulo in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andre Penner/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael Levenson covers breaking news for The Times from New York.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
