When he launched a bid for the presidency in 2016, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. — now the president — flew to Davao to ask if he could be his running mate. (He was turned down.)</p><p>To Mr. Duterte’s supporters, Davao became a model city under him: safe, orderly and disciplined. His critics said it was a place where extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals were normalized.</p><p>Mr. Duterte is <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/CourtRecords/0902ebd180aeb09d.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused by the I.C.C.</a> of running a so-called death squad in Davao City, a vigilante group that acted as judge, jury and executioner. Its targets mainly were petty criminals and small-time drug dealers from poor neighborhoods, rights groups say.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>From 1998 to 2015, the squad killed at least 1,424 people in Davao alone, according to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.ph/2025/01/without-dismantling-the-death-squads-communities-continue-to-be-vulnerable-and-right-to-life-in-serious-danger/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a local coalition cited by Amnesty</a> International. As president, Duterte’s drug war was even bloodier. Rights groups place the death toll between 12,000 and 30,000.</p><p>Now Mr. Duterte is trying a political comeback from his cell, running for mayor of the city he first governed in 1988 and ruled for over two decades.</p><p>His youngest son, Sebastian Duterte, holds the post but stepped aside to run for vice mayor. The campaign for the May 12 election began on March 28 — Mr. Duterte’s birthday.</p><p>Karlo Nograles, a former cabinet secretary for President Duterte, had been seen as leading the mayoral race against the unpopular incumbent. But political analysts said the elder Mr. Duterte’s candidacy had upended the race, and that he stood a good chance of winning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Duterte’s campaign to become mayor of Davao City again has also created ripples in national politics in the Philippines.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Noel Celis/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Analysts see the candidacies of Mr. Duterte and his family members as an effort to defend and maintain his family’s crumbling dynasty in the south.</p><p>Another son of Mr. Duterte, Paolo, is also running for office as a district representative. Paolo’s son, Rodrigo II, is aiming to become a city councilor. If all four Dutertes win, and the former president resigns after the election, Sebastian would become mayor, and Rodrigo II could become vice mayor if he wins more votes than other elected councilors.</p><p>With elections for the Senate taking place the same day, Mr. Duterte’s campaign has also had ripple effects in national politics. That has further complicated a tangled web of allegiances and rivalries in which President Marcos has been at odds with his vice president, Sara Duterte, his predecessor’s daughter.</p><p>Mr. Marcos said early in his administration that he would not cooperate with the I.C.C. in its pursuit of Mr. Duterte, but later reversed course after Ms. Duterte threatened to have him and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/world/asia/philippines-president-assassination-threat.html" title="">his family assassinated</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>In Manila, some candidates for the Senate who are aligned with Mr. Duterte appeared to be getting a slight lift in the polls, political analysts say.
