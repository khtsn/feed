A lot has predictably changed along the way, yet one of the enjoyable aspects about reunion tours is that when a group has charmed its way into your consciousness, like this one did back in the day, a.k.a. 1988, you don’t mind (too much) its sporadically sour notes and slack timing.</p><p>And, so, enter the dependably delightful Ryder as Lydia Deetz, the onetime Goth Girl whose family got into so much trouble the last time. Dressed in her customary black, from bangs to booted toe, her face as ethereally pale as ever, Lydia is the host of a paranormally inclined TV show, “Ghost House With Lydia Deetz,” and now a minor celebrity. She puts on a good front on camera, but Lydia remains a haunted soul, and now there’s more than memories of Beetlejuice (Keaton) that plague her: She’s a widow, and her daughter, Astrid (Jenna Ortega), is an eyeball-rolling, heavy-sighing mini-me of gloom, one who’s just itching to have her world rocked.</p><p>Burton seems anxious do just that, and he gets this party started without ceremony, cranking it into nicely morbid life as the characters make their introductions. Among these is the first film’s most clueless chucklehead, Lydia’s stepmother, Delia (O’Hara), an arty artist with an outsize ego and cruel lack of talent. Lydia is on warmer terms with her, partly because she needs someone on her side, given that her father is soon dead; he’s dispatched early in a satisfyingly bloody animated sequence. (The character was played in the first film by Jeffrey Jones, who pleaded guilty in 2010 to not updating his registration as a <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/natl-ferris-bueller-star-jeffrey-jones-pleads-guilty-in-sex-offender-case/1856712/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sex offender</a>.)</p><p>Her father’s death becomes the excuse for Lydia and the rest to return to the family’s old shrieking ground, a hillside fun house with an airy porch and troublesome pests. Once there, Burton cuts loose his cheerfully malignant clowns, and the characters settle down to business with magic portals and visitors from beyond. In bland strokes, Burton et al. also toss in a few romantic complications, partly, it seems, because someone here believes that female characters require love interests. One entanglement involves Lydia and her producer-boyfriend, Rory (Justin Theroux, farcically insufferable), a mindful kick-me-sign; the other, less developed one concerns Astrid and a local cutie, Jeremy (Arthur Conti).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I don’t know why anyone thought that Beetlejuice needed any kind love interest outside Lydia, his old crush. Whatever the case, Monica Bellucci turns up as his ex, the latest in a line of showy Burton vixens. Given her character’s soul-sucking toxicity, it’s hard not to wonder if the filmmakers are making a joke about bad divorces. Bellucci doesn’t have much to do but look hot, which is easy. Like Willem Dafoe — who’s predictably diverting playing a hammy (totally canned) dead actor — Bellucci is attractive filigree, something to admire amid the chats, chuckles and appealingly humble practical effects that still carry the touch of the human hand.</p><p>The greatest special effect remains Keaton’s Beetlejuice, however attenuated. The original movie was at once a funfair and a comic family meltdown with heart (and other body parts), but what pushed it joyously over the top was Keaton. With his deathly white face and electric-chair shock of hair, Beetlejuice had been designed to seize your attention (and maybe evoke Jack Nicholson in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”). What held you rapt, though, was Keaton’s exciting expressive range and unpredictability. With his wild eyes and raspy growl, he pushed and pulled at your affections, and made you wonder about the guy under the get-up. He seemed borderline dangerous, which gave the film frisson. Even as “Beetlejuice” playfully hit its genre notes, Keaton’s vocalizations — he spat words and all but scatted — and his twitchy physicality kept the film from slipping into the generic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Nostalgia is one of the strongest draws when it comes to reunions; it’s also one of the trickiest hazards for filmmakers to navigate. If a director deviates too far from the original material’s pleasures, or opportunistically tries to reproduce them, old fans may resent the follow-up while new viewers end up baffled or bored, and tuning out. I assume that’s one reason that Burton and company — the script was written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who share story credit with Seth Grahame-Smith — have played it safe in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” going lightly meta while replaying their greatest hits with knowing winks. That’s fine; I wish it were better.</p><p>To a degree and certainly by studio-sequel design, “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” has a cozy familiarity. If the manic edginess of Keaton’s original performance suggested that his character had ingested way too much caffeine, though probably something a great deal stronger, he now seems more like a super-eccentric uncle — only, you know, dead. Beetlejuice hasn’t exactly reformed, but somewhat like Burton, he’s straighter, smoother, less tightly wound and less a destabilizing force. He’s also become a boss, with a crew at his beck and call. Like the rest of the Beetlejuice brethren, he seems almost grown-up. Going into this movie, I wondered if the entertainingly unrepressed can ever return. No, it cannot, ever — but I still giggled.</p><p><strong>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</strong></p></div></div></section><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
