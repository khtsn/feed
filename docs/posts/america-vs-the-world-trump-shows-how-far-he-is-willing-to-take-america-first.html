The first weeks of the second Trump term have taken on the feel of America vs. the world.</p><p>“The free world needs a new leader,” Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, wrote on social media after Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html" title="">clashed with President Volodymyr Zelensky</a> of Ukraine in the Oval Office last week. “It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs — 25 percent on most imports from Canada and Mexico and two rounds of 10 percent levies on imports from China — which he has said are punishment for their failure to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.</p><p>The moves have quickly sparked a trade war: China and Canada retaliated immediately, imposing their own tariffs on U.S. goods on Tuesday. Mexico said it would announce its countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs, on Sunday.</p><p>The list of countries targeted by Mr. Trump has continued to grow. He has mocked Canada as the 51st state and called its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, a “governor.” (As a result, Mr. Trudeau’s low approval risings got a noticeable rise after Mr. Trump targeted the country.)</p><p>He has threatened to seize the Panama Canal and annex Greenland from Denmark. He has frozen military aid for Ukraine as the country attempts to fight off a Russian invasion. He has cut off foreign aid that benefits countries throughout Africa, South America and Asia. Now he has imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Some of his many threats may just be that — threats or negotiating tactics — but Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to follow through particularly when it comes to tariffs and withholding foreign aid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It means uncertainty, because right now, it isn’t always clear what is a tactic and what is actually meant,” said Nicholas J. Cull, professor of public diplomacy at the University of Southern California. “So it’s very confusing for people, and I suspect that a lot of foreign policy is being played for domestic audiences to get cheers from the base and to keep people uncertain.”</p><p>Slightly more Americans approve of Mr. Trump than disapprove after the first weeks in office of his second term, according to averages of polls. He will give a joint address to Congress this evening.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>America vs. The World:</strong> President Trump shows how far he is willing to take ‘America First,’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-america-first.html">fraying alliances across the globe</a> with his words and actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crypto Reserve Plan:</strong> The prospect of using taxpayer money to stockpile cryptocurrencies in a national reserve has drawn criticism from lawmakers and investors. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/dealbook/trump-crypto-reserve-what-we-know.html">Here’s what we know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulating Infant Formula</strong><strong>:</strong> The new head of the Food and Drug Administration division that regulates infant formula <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/fda-infant-formula-kyle-diamantas.html">was recently a corporate lawyer defending a top formula maker</a> from claims that its product gave rise to debilitating harm to premature babies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fears of Interference: </strong>Comments from Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, have renewed concerns that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/economy/gdp-data-lutnick-commerce-secretary.html">could seek to interfere with federal statistics</a> — especially if they start to show that the economy is slipping into a recession.</p></li><li><p><strong>Top F.B.I.
