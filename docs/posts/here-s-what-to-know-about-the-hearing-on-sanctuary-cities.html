The mayors will be forced to walk a fine line, defending their cities’ sanctuary policies while trying to avoid viral moments that could be used to attack them and other Democrats in future campaigns. </p><div><p>Here’s what we’re covering:</p><p><strong>The committee:</strong> Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform are expected to echo Mr. Trump’s attacks during the hearing. The committee, which is led by James Comer and stocked with Republican firebrands including Jim Jordan, Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene, promoted the mayors’ appearance with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NuxHdbsfyE&amp;ab_channel=GOPOversight" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sizzle reel</a> set to dramatic music and video clips of tent cities, criminals with guns and the Declaration of Independence up in flames. </p><p><strong>What’s at stake:</strong> Republicans have been critical of any community deemed a “sanctuary city,” a catchall phrase to describe jurisdictions that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Democrats have long championed these restrictions as a way to create safe and welcoming communities for immigrants. But such policies have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as migrants arrive in those cities in greater numbers, straining resources. </p><p><strong>Difficult task</strong>: The hearing could be a minefield for the four mayors. They will need to defend themselves and their policies, while also stating that they follow all federal laws. The leaders will try to sidestep the kind of stumbles that derailed the presidents of Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, who lost their jobs after testifying before Congress about campus antisemitism. </p><p><strong>Special challenges</strong>: Both parties are expected to scrutinize Mayor Eric Adams of New York, a former police officer who has echoed Republican criticism of sanctuary policies. The Trump administration has moved to drop federal corruption charges against Mr. Adams, and the prosecutor previously overseeing the case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/danielle-sassoon-quit-eric-adams.html" title="">suggested that the mayor had offered to help</a> with the administration’s immigration efforts in exchange for leniency, a charge his lawyers deny. </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ1ZTYzZjU5LTEwNmQtNTNkMi04NjcxLWNmYTEzYjkzMTNhMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/sanctuary-cities-hearing#bostons-mayor-says-the-citys-approach-works-touting-low-homicide-rate" data-source-id="100000010028701"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jenna-russell"><img alt="Jenna Russell" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-jenna-russell/author-jenna-russell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-jenna-russell/author-jenna-russell-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/17/reader-center/author-jenna-russell/author-jenna-russell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-05T14:21:13.461Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 5, 2025, 9:21 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jenna-russell" itemprop="name">Jenna Russell</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ1ZTYzZjU5LTEwNmQtNTNkMi04NjcxLWNmYTEzYjkzMTNhMw=="><a href="#bostons-mayor-says-the-citys-approach-works-touting-low-homicide-rate">Boston’s mayor says the city’s approach works, touting low homicide rate.</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A local law prohibits Boston police officers from participating in most federal immigration enforcement actions, unless crimes have been committed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It would be fair to say that Michelle Wu, the mayor of Boston, and the Trump administration do not get along.</p><p>Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, has threatened the city with increased immigration enforcement and suggested that the police chief should resign. “I’m coming to Boston, and I’m bringing hell with me,” he said last month.</p><div><p>Ms. Wu, a first-term Democrat, called the comments “clueless.”</p><p>A Harvard-educated progressive who speaks fluent Spanish, Ms. Wu, 40, has done little to retreat. She has instead spent time assuring immigrants that the city remains a safe and welcoming place.</p><p>A flashpoint in tensions between the Trump administration and the city is a local law <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/council-reaffirms-trust-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">known as the Trust Act</a>. It prohibits Boston police officers from participating in most federal immigration enforcement actions, though they can assist in some cases when crimes have been committed.</p><p>Earlier this year, federal officials accused the Boston police of ignoring dozens of <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/01/09/how-many-ice-requests-did-boston-police-receive-2024-it-depends-who-you-ask/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal requests</a> to detain undocumented immigrants. Police officials said that they had never received most of the requests because Immigration and Customs Enforcement had disregarded the department’s request in 2023 to submit its requests by email instead of fax.</p><p>Mayor Wu has defended the city’s approach as the best way to preserve trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. And she promotes Boston’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/boston-homicides-violence-prevention.html" title="">public safety record</a>: In 2024, there were 24 homicides, the lowest number since at least 1957.</p><p>Gov. Maura Healey has taken the brunt of the criticism, especially for <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/01/10/healey-says-she-ordered-criminal-background-checks-on-all-shelter-residents-last-spring-but-they-didnt-happen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the state’s failure to conduct criminal background checks</a> on shelter residents. And Massachusetts had difficulty handling the 2023 surge in migrants. </p><p>Many of them arrived from Haiti, drawn to a long-established Haitian American community in Boston and the state’s longstanding right-to-shelter law. Contracts with motels and hotels cost Massachusetts hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>For her part, Mayor Wu, who is up for re-election this year, seems ready to spar during the hearing.</p><p>“I’m there, no matter how challenging the circumstances, to stand up for Boston, and also to stand up for the truth, the facts, of who we are,” Ms. Wu, a daughter of immigrants from Taiwan, told reporters when asked about the hearing. </p><p>“Some people are trying to paint a story of cities where immigrants live as dangerous places,” she said, “when in fact we are proof of the opposite.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad0"><div id="ad-0" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZTJiMzI3MDMtYTYzZS01OTUxLWJlZTYtZWViNzcxYjJlNzZl"><div id="e2b32703-a63e-5951-bee6-eeb771b2e76e" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/sanctuary-cities-hearing#e2b32703-a63e-5951-bee6-eeb771b2e76e"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-healy"><img alt="Jack Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/02/us/author-jack-healy/author-jack-healy-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/02/us/author-jack-healy/author-jack-healy-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/02/us/author-jack-healy/author-jack-healy-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-05T14:19:25.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 5, 2025, 9:19 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jack-healy" itemprop="name">Jack Healy</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting on Denver</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>I’m watching for how Mayor Mike Johnston of Denver tries to rebut the accusation that his city isn’t cooperating with immigration enforcement.

Municipal finances are tight. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/us/chicago-real-estate-tax-vote.html" title="">Voters rejected</a> his plan to use new tax revenue to address the growing homeless population. Contract negotiations with the teachers’ union, Mr. Johnson’s longtime employer, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/us/chicago-public-schools-pedro-martinez.html" title="">exposed divisions</a> on the City Council.</p><p>But those debates have been primarily with his fellow Democrats. As Mr. Johnson heads to Washington, he will engage with Republicans on an issue that may pose a larger political threat to himself and the government he leads.</p><div><p>For years, Republicans have singled out Chicago, the nation’s third most populous city, as an avatar for all that ails urban America. Chief among their grievances is a city ordinance that blocks cooperation on immigration enforcement.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Trump took office, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-immigration-chicago-sanctuary.html" title="">Justice Department sued Mr. Johnson</a> over Chicago’s immigration policies and also said it could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/justice-department-immigration-enforcement.html" title="">prosecute local officials</a> who prosecutors believed were impeding the work of immigration officers.</p><p>During Mr. Johnson’s nearly two-year tenure, Chicago has struggled to manage the influx of migrants, many of whom camped outside police stations or slept on airport floors after being bused north by Texas conservatives. Though the flow of new arrivals has slowed considerably, the local politics may have shifted. Some Chicagoans protested plans to open new shelters in their neighborhoods, and a handful of City Council members tried, but failed, to roll back the ordinance limiting cooperation with immigration officials.</p><p>Through it all, Mr. Johnson has defended Chicago’s status as a “welcoming city” for undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The hearing on Wednesday will be a major test for Mr. Johnson, who until his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/04/04/us/chicago-mayor-runoff" title="">election in 2023</a> held a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/us/brandon-johnson-chicago-mayor-runoff-teachers.html" title="">relatively low-profile</a> seat as a county commissioner. His time as mayor has had bright spots, including reductions in the homicide rate. But he has not fully sold residents or City Council members on his vision for Chicago, and he has often struggled to turn his priorities into policy.</p><p>On immigration, though, he has not wavered.</p><p>“Our song of unity won’t change because who’s in the White House,” Mr. Johnson said last week.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
