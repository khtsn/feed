Putin of Russia.</p><p>It was a complete reversal of historic alliances that left many in Europe stunned and fearful.</p><p>“What’s happening is very bad. It’s a reversal of the state of the world since 1945,” Jean- Yves Le Drian, a former French foreign minister, said on French radio Wednesday morning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s our security he’s putting at risk,” he said, referring to President Trump. “We must wake up.”</p><p>In the vacuum, Mr. Macron has tried to show leadership, corralling allied leaders, particularly in Europe, to devise a united response.</p><p>The Élysée Palace announced that he would host a second emergency meeting on Wednesday, stating that the interim president of Romania, Ilie Bolojan, would attend in person while other leaders were expected by video.</p><p>The meeting comes the day after Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian representatives including Foreign Minister Sergei V. Lavrov in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a peace deal for the war in Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/middleeast/ukraine-trump-russia-war-peace-talks.html" title="">to the fury of its president, Volodymyr Zelensky,</a> who was not invited.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, seated second from left, meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V.

And a long time before that,” Mr. Trump said. “This could have been settled very easily. Just a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without, I think, without the loss of much land, very little land. Without the loss of any lives. And without the loss of cities that are just laying on their sides.”</p><p>Mr. Le Drian called it a monstrous reversal of world alliances, as well as an “inversion of the truth.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“The victim becomes the attacker,” he said, adding that the United States seemed to be retreating to a 19th-century view of itself, and telling an aggressive, expansionist Russia to do what it wants in Europe. “It’s the law of the strongest,” he said, adding “tomorrow, it could be Moldavia and after tomorrow, it could be Estonia because Putin won’t stop.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at a news  conference in Ankara, Turkey, on Tuesday.

They are also talking about how to ramp up the development of European defense industries.</p><p>Over the past week, Europe’s steadfast position that held the United States as the central pole of its defense guarantee seems to be changing, said Martin Quencez, the director of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund.</p><p>The big question will be whether European nations follow through with increased military spending and maintain a united front, without fracturing off to individually negotiate with Mr. Trump, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“I’ve heard Europe talk about wake-up calls so many times over the past 10 years, I remain cautious,” he said, pointing out that many European leaders, including Mr. Macron, find themselves in fragile political and economic positions in their own countries.</p><p>“I’m sure we will hear from every European leader, but let’s see what actual decisions are taken,” he said, adding: “It’s very, very difficult to tell your population., we’re going to have to make the tough choice of prioritizing European security over, social issues or environmental issues. Not many governments have the political capital to spend on all this.”</p><p>Jeanna Smialek<!-- --> contributed reporting from Brussels</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
