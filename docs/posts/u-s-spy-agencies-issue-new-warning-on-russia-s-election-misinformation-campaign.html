The address on the card led to an office park in Lawrenceville, Ga.</p><p>Social media users shared the video in group channel on X created by Elon Musk’s political action committee to collect allegations of voter fraud. Darren L. Linvill, a professor and the director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University, said the video appeared to be a production of a Russian operation know to researchers as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/us/politics/russia-disinformation-election.html" title="">Storm-1516</a>.</p><p><em>“</em>The style and production values of the video are exactly in line with what we’ve seen from them before,” Mr. Linvill said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Similar to other fabricated videos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/election-warning-russia-iran.html" title="">produced by Russian operatives</a>, the staged video shows the person’s face and does not reveal information about their location.</p><p>Mr. Raffensperger said he had asked Mr. Musk, the owner of X, to remove the false video from the social media platform. The post is no longer available.</p><p>Last week, a Russian disinformation group created and pushed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/pennsylvania-ballots-video-russia.html" title="">a video falsely suggesting that ballots</a> in Bucks County, Pa., had been destroyed. But local election officials quickly informed the public that the video was fake, and U.S. intelligence officials said it was the work of Russians.</p><p>Storm-1516, the Russian group, has spread a variety of videos trying to sow distrust in the election. A video created by the group earlier this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/us/politics/russia-disinformation-election.html" title="">falsely accused the C.I.A.</a> of setting up a troll farm in Ukraine to boost President Biden and Democrats.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/media/election-disinformation.html" title="">Disinformation</a> maligning Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, has circulated quickly. But false claims about voting irregularity claims have proved harder to spread, in part because they are much easier to disprove than murky claims about a candidate’s past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As the Bucks County video makes clear, Russian disinformation groups have begun a partial shift toward election conduct. The government statement on Friday said the videos were part of “Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.”</p><p>Even with the two prominent examples of Russians seeking to undermine faith in the vote, Clint Watts, the head of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, said there was overall less disinformation focused on voting irregularities than at this point in previous election cycles. That may reflect a calculation that former President Donald J. Trump could win and that emphasizing irregularities could cloud a victory.</p><p>“They don’t want to undermine an election in which maybe they get the outcome they want,” Mr. Watts said. “Maybe this time they are a bit more reserved about it.”</p><p>Intelligence officials have said that Russia favors Mr. Trump in the election. The former president’s skepticism of military support for Ukraine, which Russia invaded nearly three years ago, and his promise to force peace talks quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/october-election-interference.html" title="">have raised the stakes</a> in the election for Russia, officials say.</p><p>Microsoft expects Russian disinformation groups to quickly create more content if the election is contested. <a href="https://www.odni.gov/files/FMIC/documents/ODNI-Election-Security-Update-20241021.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. intelligence agencies have also predicted</a> that Russia will attempt to stoke violence after the election if Mr. Trump is defeated, or if the election is close.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Russia could undermine the public’s faith in the vote either by manufacturing false claims — like the spoiled ballots in Bucks County — or by amplifying concerns of Americans over potential voting irregularities.</p><p>Over the past few months, intelligence officials have said that Iran favors Ms. Harris. Iranian-backed hackers took information from the Trump campaign and tried to spread it. U.S. intelligence agencies tracked a potential Iranian assassination plot <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-security-threats.html" title="">to assassinate Mr. Trump</a>.</p><p>But in recent weeks, Mr. Watts said, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, or I.R.G.C., has been relatively quiet at least when it comes to spreading disinformation.</p><p>“This is the week we would expect the I.R.G.C. doing a hack and leak, a cyberoperation or a provocation,” Mr. Watts said. “And we have not seen it yet.”</p><p>Ms. Harris has come out strongly against Iran, naming it as a top threat to the United States. And the Biden administration has warned Iran that any plot against Mr. Trump or attempt on his life would be considered an act of war.</p><p>“If Iran is not sure what they get with either candidate, why root for either one because it puts them in a tough spot after the election,” Mr. Watts said. “I am not sure they are convinced they get what they want out of it.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julian E.
