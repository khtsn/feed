While one young girl was among the dead, many of those targeted appeared to be connected to Hezbollah, their injuries adding physical blows to the psychological one.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It is a serious attack,” Mr. Hage Ali said, adding that during 11 months of aerial attacks across the Lebanon-Israel border, Hezbollah had lost many leaders and cadres, some in targeted assassinations. </p><p>“And now this blow cuts through the rank and file of the organization,” he said. “It is a kind of sword stabbed deep into the organization’s body, and it will take it time to heal from that.”</p><p>Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, but its leaders have otherwise given no indication of how this attack could change its approach to the fighting with Israel or its broader conflict with the Jewish state.</p><p>Hezbollah was formed in the 1980s, with Iranian help, to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended in 2000. In the years since, it has grown into Lebanon’s most effective political party and fighting force, and expanded its operations into Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hezbollah fighters at the funeral of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander of the group, in the suburbs of Beirut in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>It lost many members in its last major war with Israel, in 2006, but emerged stronger in the following years, building a vast arsenal that is believed to include more than 100,000 rockets and other sophisticated weapons like precision-guided missiles that can hit sensitive sites inside Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There is nothing in Hezbollah’s history or ideology that suggests that Tuesday’s attack will cause it to change course or seek an accommodation with Israel. But experts on the group said it is stuck between feeling the need to respond and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel.html" title="">wanting to avoid an all-out war with Israel</a> that could be catastrophic for both sides.</p><p>Complicating its decision is that Hezbollah has linked its cross-border strikes on Israel to the war in Gaza, leading officials in Washington and elsewhere to hope that a cease-fire there between Israel and Hamas would bring quiet to the Lebanese border as well. Tuesday’s attack could change that calculation.</p><p>“Hezbollah is in a trap of its own making,” said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “Having tied their confrontation with Israel to the ongoing war on Gaza limits their options to de-escalate. This attack makes it even harder for them to do so.”</p><p>Inside Lebanon, it remains unclear how the shock of<span>  </span>Tuesday’s blasts will affect Hezbollah’s own fiercely loyal community, Ms. Slim said.</p><p>“This will also add to fatigue and weariness already developing inside Hezbollah’s constituency,” she said. “On the other hand, it might increase demands inside the constituency for Hezbollah to strike back hard.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Considers Firing Gallant:</strong><strong> </strong>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-netanyahu-gallant.html">contemplating dismissing his defense minister</a>, Yoav Gallant, a move that would remove a frequent critic at a time of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-gaza.html">mounting tensions with Hezbollah</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hostage Deaths:</strong><strong> </strong>Israel’s military announced that, based on an internal investigation, three hostages were probably killed as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-killed-strike.html">result of an Israeli airstrike</a> targeting a senior Hamas commander in November.</p></li><li><p><strong>​​Fight Over Philadelphi Corridor:</strong><strong> </strong>The border between Egypt and Gaza has become a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/philadelphi-corridor-israel-gaza-egypt.html">major point of contention in cease-fire negotiations</a> — not just between Israel and Hamas, but also between Israel and Egypt.</p></li><li><p><strong>How UNRWA Became a Flashpoint:</strong><strong> </strong>The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has survived 75 years of Israeli-Palestinian strife. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/magazine/unrwa-gaza-war.html">Can it survive the latest conflict</a>?</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel Raids Secret Weapons Site: </strong>Israel carried out a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/middleeast/israel-raid-syria-hezbollah.html">commando raid in Syria</a> that obliterated a Hezbollah missile production facility near the Lebanese border, according to American and other Western officials.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
