    <h1>Democrats Are Upbeat, but Face a Tough Race Ahead</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>In Chicago, where thousands of Democrats spent the week celebrating their nomination of Kamala Harris for president, confidence has been overflowing.</p><p>“The mood in Chicago was just really ebullient,” said Jess Bidgood, who writes the On Politics newsletter and spent the week at the convention. Some delegates even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/democrats-harris-convention.html" title="">suggested that Harris would glide to victory</a>.</p><p>But joy in the summer does not always last, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/harris-dnc-momentum.html" title="">translate to votes in the fall</a>. Just look at Republicans, Jess said. They were riding high at their convention last month, just after Trump survived an assassination attempt and before President Biden stepped aside. Now polls show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">Harris with a narrow lead</a>.</p><p>Harris and other top Democrats seem to be well aware that things can change. Rather than basking in her momentum, the vice president concluded the convention last night with a serious speech designed to reassure Americans of her values <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-dnc-speech-values.html" title="">and appeal to voters who might know little about her</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jerome Powell’s speech today was his most closely watched of the year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-694d38be">Powell said the ‘time has come’ for interest rate cuts</h2><p>Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, indicated today that the central bank was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/business/economy/fed-rates-powell-jackson-hole.html" title="">on track to lower borrowing costs at its meeting next month</a>. For more than a year, the Fed has been holding interest rates at 5.3 percent, the highest level in more than two decades, to combat inflation. Now, Powell said, “The time has come for policy to adjust.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>While Powell stopped short of giving a clear hint at how large that move might be, he forcefully underscored that policymakers would act in order to protect the job market.</p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A temporary shelter in Kursk, Russia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-544755f5">Ukraine ramped up its attacks in Russia</h2><p>Ukrainian forces now control more than 400 square miles in the Kursk region of Russia, where they are fighting to isolate a large group of Russian soldiers. They have also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-crimea.html" title="">launched a series of strikes</a> at airfields, ports and oil depots in other parts of the country in an effort to degrade the Kremlin’s war effort. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-invasion-map.html" title="">We mapped out Ukraine’s incursion</a>, which has succeeded far beyond expectations.</p><p>However, Ukraine has yet to fulfill a key goal: drawing a significant number of Russian units from eastern Ukraine, where Kyiv’s forces continue to struggle.
