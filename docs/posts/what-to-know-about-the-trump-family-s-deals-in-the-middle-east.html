Here is a look at the family’s interests in the region and Mr. Trump’s proposal for Gaza.</p><h2 id="link-202a35e5">What Trump proposed for Gaza</h2><p>Mr. Trump declared on Tuesday that the United States should seize control of Gaza and permanently displace the entire Palestinian population of the devastated seaside enclave.</p><p>Mr. Trump suggested the resettlement of Palestinians would be akin to the New York real estate projects he built his career on. “If we could find the right piece of land, or numerous pieces of land, and build them some really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that’s for sure,” he said. “I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land,” Mr. Trump added, “developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s aides on Wednesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/05/world/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump/here-is-the-latest?smid=url-share" title="">walked back some of his comments</a>, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, saying that “the president has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza.”</p><h2 id="link-4aaa786c">Real estate in Oman, Saudi Arabia and Dubai</h2><p>The Middle East has in the past three years turned into the hottest spot for the Trump family in terms of new international real-estate deals. Most of these are so-called branding deals, which collectively earn the family tens of millions of dollars in fees in exchange for the right to use the name to help boost luxury condo, golf or hotel sales.</p><p>Recent agreements have been signed with a Saudi-based real estate company called <a href="https://www.daralarkan.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dar Al Arkan</a> to build high-rise luxury apartments, golf courses or hotels in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/us/politics/trump-real-estate-deal-oman.html" title="">Oman</a>, <a href="https://darglobal.co.uk/trump-tower-jeddah" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="https://www.trump.com/media/dar-global-announces-third-collaboration-with-trump-organization-to-launch-iconic-trump-tower-dubai-in-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dubai</a>.</p><p>“We are delighted to strengthen our ongoing relationship with the Trump Organization,” Ziad El Chaar, an executive with Dar Al Arkan’s subsidiary, said last year, in announcing one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/trump-organization-saudi-arabia-tower.html" title="">of the deals</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The project in Oman, which is the farthest along, involves the government of Oman itself, as it owns the land where the Trump golf course and hotel are being built.</p><p>Although the opening of the resort destination is still at least <a href="https://darglobal.co.uk/press/Dar-Global-sets-a-new-benchmark-in-luxury-hospitality-with-the-launch-of-the-500ml-Trump-International-Oman-in-AIDA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three years off</a>, the Trump Organization has already raked in at least $7.5 million from the Oman deal, financial reports from the <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2023-4-trump-financial-disclosure/6acf31d6716dfdb6/full.pdf#page=6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">past two</a> years <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/0a5c19fa284801c8/2a2a7cf0-full.pdf#page=5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">show</a>. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjL5EuIlQCc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visited Oman</a> this summer to check the project’s progress, visiting the site with Yousef Al Shelash, the chairman of Dar Al Arkan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>DarGlobal, a subsidiary of the Saudi-based real estate company Dar Al Arkan, is partnering with the Trump Organization to build high-rise luxury apartments, golf courses and hotels in Oman, Saudi Arabia and Dubai.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea DiCenzo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Dar Al Arkan itself has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/us/politics/trump-real-estate-deal-oman.html" title="">close ties</a> with the Saudi royal family; the government there has been an important partner for the real estate company’s owners as they have built up their business.</p><p>The Trump family also examined a potential deal in Israel before the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and remains interested in doing a project there, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/trump-organization-israel-hotels.html" title="">The Times previously reported</a>. Mr. Trump’s son Eric Trump has said he intends to wait until the war ends before moving ahead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Even before this recent burst of new Middle East deals, the Trump family already had an outpost in the region. Trump International Golf Club, Dubai, opened in 2017, shortly after Mr. Trump started his first term in the White House.</p><p>The partner in this Dubai club is DAMAC Properties, run by <a href="http://www.hussainsajwani.com/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hussain Sajwani</a>, a billionaire real-estate executive who, Mr. Trump boasted in December, plans to invest billions of dollars in the United States to build data centers.</p><h2 id="link-24922a8f">A partnership with LIV Golf</h2><p>The Trump family also has been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/us/politics/trump-golf-saudi-arabia.html" title="">key partner to LIV Golf,</a> the upstart professional golf league financed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. In April, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/liv-golf-tournament-trump-doral-resort.html" title="">for the fourth year in a row</a>, the league is slated to hold one of its tournaments at the Trump National Doral near Miami.</p><p>LIV Golf pays the Trump family to host the tournament, which also drives thousands of customers to its restaurants and hotel rooms during the weekend event, scheduled for April of this year. Mr. Trump and his family own more than a dozen golf courses worldwide, all of which benefit from the media attention that the Saudi-backed tournament brings.</p><p>Mr. Trump has long sought to attract these kinds of tournaments to his golf courses, but had at least one major event canceled after a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-74976119">Jared Kushner’s investments</h2><p>The president’s son-in-law, Mr. Kushner, runs a private equity firm called Affinity Partners that has raised $4.5 billion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/us/politics/jared-kushner-affinity-partners.html" title="">mostly from sovereign wealth funds</a> of the oil-rich nations of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, based on relationships he built as an adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term.</p><p>Mr. Kushner, who has said he does not plan to return to the White House, also has invested in at least two Israel-based businesses: Phoenix Holdings, an insurance company, and the car leasing division of Shlomo Holdings.</p><p>Mr. Kushner’s business partner at Shlomo Holdings is also a partial owner of Israel’s only domestic builder of warships. That puts him in business with executives who are also major shareholders in an Israeli military contractor whose vessels <a href="https://videoidf.azureedge.net/38e0e6da-8a51-4417-b249-194f412928fb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been used</a> in the <a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/61170" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">war in Gaza</a>, armed with American-made weapons.</p><p>It was Mr. Kushner who last year first floated the idea of considering Gaza as a potential real-estate development site. “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable,” Mr. Kushner said last year during an <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjS0cKSsK2LAxVqMlkFHewABLYQtwJ6BAgJEAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdtaIHr5S0ts&amp;usg=AOvVaw1izGGYHU59o-1mi9K37mND&amp;opi=89978449" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event sponsored by Harvard’</a>s Kennedy School of Government, suggesting that Israel “move the people out and then clean it up.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Lipton is an investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic chemicals.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-lipton">More about Eric Lipton</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/liv-golf">LIV Golf</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jared-kushner">Jared Kushner</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tariffs:</strong> President Trump’s demands on the United States’ neighbors are difficult to measure.
