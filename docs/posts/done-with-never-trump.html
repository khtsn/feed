I also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/opinion/trump-2024-election.html" title="">opposed</a> him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/opinion/nikki-haley-campaign-primary.html" title="">throughout</a> his run <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/opinion/trump-conservative-harris-election.html" title="">this year</a>.</p><p>Could his second term be as bad as his most fervent critics fear? Yes. Is it time to drop the heavy moralizing and incessant doomsaying that typified so much of the Never Trump movement — and that rendered it politically impotent and frequently obtuse? Yes, please.</p><p>Who, and what, is Trump? He’s a man and the symbol of a movement. The man is crass but charismatic, ignorant but intuitive, dishonest but authentic. The movement is patriotic — and angry.</p><p>Some of that anger is intensely bigoted and some of it misplaced. That side of the anger gets most of the media’s attention. But some of it, too, is correctly directed at a self-satisfied elite that thinks it knows better but often doesn’t, whether the subject is Covid restrictions, immigration policy or how to get our allies to pay more for their defense.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It’s Trump’s sulfurous contempt for that elite — his refusal to be shaped by their norms or shamed by their scorn and his willingness to call out their hypocrisy — that makes him a hero to his followers. Cases in point: How come so many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/23/gloria-steinem-meets-gloria-allred-prince-andrew" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who denounce</a> Trump as a sexual predator were, 20 years earlier, Bill Clinton’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/22/opinion/feminists-and-the-clinton-question.html" title="">steadfast defenders</a>? Why were the same people who demanded investigations into every corner of the Trump family’s business dealings so incurious about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/opinion/biden-ethics-son.html" title="">Biden family’s dealings</a>, like the curiously high prices for Hunter’s paintings?</p><p>Never Trumpers — I include myself in this indictment — never quite got the point. It wasn’t that we’d forgotten Clinton’s scandals or were ignorant of the allegations about the Bidens. It’s that we thought Trump degraded the values that conservatives were supposed to stand for. We also thought that Trump represented a form of illiberalism that was antithetical to our “free people, free markets, free world” brand of conservatism and that was bound to take the Republican Party down a dark road.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
