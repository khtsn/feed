</span>, who finished 3-2 in Group Omega.</p>

<p>The match started out on Nongshim&#39;s pick of Lotus, a map that the squad has been workshopping its team comp on throughout the stage. While the double-Controller pairing of Omen and Viper was one that Nongshim had fielded many times before, the lack of a Sentinel for a second Initiator caused some troubles for the squad. With little to nothing to hold back TALON&#39;s double Duelist comp, Nongshim managed just two rounds on the defender side. Rookie Duelist <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/42901/thyy">
		thyy	</a>
</span> was running rampant on that side of the map, exploding for 18 kills on the attacker side alone.</p>

<p>Nongshim managed to convert the pistol and anti-eco rounds to start attack, but TALON took care of business to steal their opponent&#39;s map pick 13-5.</p>


<p><em>TALON finishes off Lotus with a bang.</em></p>

<p>To begin TALON&#39;s pick of Corrode, Nongshim threatened to flip the script, starting with a 4-0 lead on defense. TALON bounced back swiftly, finishing the half down just 7-5. On defense, TALON&#39;s double Sentinel comp, which put <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/25255/primmie">

</span> on Deadlock and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13788/jitboys">
		JitBoyS	</a>
</span> on Cypher, paid dividends. The Thai squad erased Nongshim&#39;s halftime lead, jumping out to a 10-7 lead. TALON threatened to end the map, but a series of hero plays from the likes of <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4122/persia">
		Persia	</a>
</span> got Nongshim to match point in a flash. The smokes player had four triple kills and five double kills, and finished the map with a team-high rating.</p>

<p>TALON, however, fought off two straight map points to force overtime, and in the third set of OT found an attacker-sided win to wrap up the map 15-13. primmie was named the MVP of the map, ending with a server-high 30 kills while rookie Initiator <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13784/killua">
		Killua	</a>
</span> added 27 of his own. </p>

</span> were both looking for positive starts to the playoffs after shaky showings in the group stage. Both teams went 3-2 in their respective groups. With RRQ the defending regional champions with their success in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> and T1 having lifted a trophy at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2281/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025" target="_blank">Masters Bangkok</a>, a lot of silverware-winning experience was on the stage for this match. </p>

<p>T1 turned heads in the map veto process, selecting Bind as their first map pick. The map, a previous ban of theirs. While T1 went for a double-Controller comp, RRQ opted for a double-Duelist comp with <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24895/jemkin">
		Jemkin	</a>
</span> on Yoru and <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8497/monyet">
		Monyet	</a>
</span> on Waylay. An anti-eco put an Operator into Jemkin&#39;s hands by the third round, and while RRQ threatened to snowball early with a 5-2 lead, they entered halftime down 7-5. </p>

<p>Despite having two Duelists, RRQ&#39;s execute-heavy approach was countered with T1&#39;s own comp, which had five mollies. The ability to delay plants and deny entry in choke points was a valuable strength for T1, who relied on heavily on <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span>&#39;s map-high 24 kills to close out the map 13-9.</p>

<p>RRQ&#39;s map pick of Haven saw both teams field identical double-Duelist comps, centered around Neon and Yoru and complemented by Cypher, Omen, and Sova. A strong defender half, with some thanks to Jemkin&#39;s operator once again, meant the SEA squad entered halftime up 7-5. In the second half, RRQ gave up just two rounds in total to win the map 13-7 to force a third. </p>

<p>The decider map of Sunset is one that RRQ was not quite comfortable with this year, and it showed in this match. A solo-Duelist comp with Waylay went up against T1&#39;s double-Duelist comp, and early on, it looked as though RRQ&#39;s map pick was working out to perfection. Jemkin and Monyet, the latter on Omen, combined for 26 kills on defense, but the attack half is where they struggled mightily. After finishing halftime tied 6-6, T1 bulldozed its way through the defender side, dropping just two rounds en route to winning 13-8.</p>


<p><em><span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> on the perfect line with the op to help T1 reach match point.</em></p>

<p>A well-rounded T1 performance saw Meteor lead a pack of four players with at least 40 kills, while Jemkin&#39;s efforts with 60 kills on the other side of the stage were not enough on the day. </p>
