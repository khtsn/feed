President Trump held office, he tried to make deep cuts to foreign aid, but was blocked by Congress. He is finding little resistance from fellow Republicans this time to his move to freeze such funding.</p><p>During a special counsel’s inquiry in his first term, Mr. Trump expressed a desire to fire the investigator, but White House lawyers stopped him. This term, Mr. Trump has swiftly forced out a slew of federal officials who had oversight roles over his administration.</p><p>In the final days of his first presidency, Mr. Trump tried to hire a loyalist to help run the F.B.I., until Attorney General Bill Barr objected, Mr. Barr said in his book after he left office. Now that same loyalist, Kash Patel, is poised to lead the bureau.</p><p>At every step in his second term, Mr. Trump is demonstrating how unbound he is from prior restraints, dramatically remaking both domestic and foreign policy at a scale that has little parallel. His swift moves in his first month back in office underscore the confidence of an administration with a much firmer grip on the levers of government than during Mr. Trump’s last stint in the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Long gone are the veterans of the Bush and Reagan administrations who pushed him to hew to more traditional conservative policies. In their place are a group of mostly America First Republicans helping Mr. Trump radically reset the country’s policies — as well as the billionaire Elon Musk, whom the president has unleashed to barrel through the bureaucracy.</p><p>“We’ve never seen anything on the scale of what Donald Trump’s new administration is doing,” said Jeffrey A. Engel, who leads the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. “It’s not just a reversal of previous administration policies — which we always expect to see a little bit of — but a reversal of the fundamentals of American foreign policy since 1945.”</p><p>Consider Mr. Trump’s actions in the past week alone:</p><ul><li><p>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/putin-trump-call-russia-ukraine.html" title="">ended</a> efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, speaking at length with President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Trump characterized the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/trump-putin-call-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">conversation</a> as the opening of talks to end the war — with no clear role for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p></li><li><p>His administration began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-federal-personnel-layoffs.html" title="">widespread layoffs</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/energy-department-layoffs.html" title="">across the government</a>, targeting most of an estimated 200,000 federal workers on probation, a sharp escalation in the president’s drive to shrink the work force.</p></li><li><p>Top Trump officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/nyregion/eric-adams-drop-charges-sdny.html" title="">plunged</a> the Justice Department deeper into chaos with its move to drop corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York, triggering a cascade of resignations from prosecutors.</p></li><li><p>Mr. Trump proposed an aggressive global reworking of tariffs — devising <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-tariffs.html" title="">what he calls “reciprocal tariffs”</a> that could shatter the commitments the United States has made internationally through the World Trade Organization and potentially usher in a new era of trade wars.</p></li></ul><p>Amid it all, the president continued to sign executive orders at a breakneck speed, taking moves to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/trump-foreign-service.html" title="">weaken</a> the job protections of career diplomats and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-federal-workers.html" title="">expand</a> Mr. Musk’s power over the federal work force.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies say his actions show how fast he is moving to fulfill the promises he made voters.</p><p>“It’s been at a rapid pace,” said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican in the House. “If you compare Donald Trump’s first month in office in 2017 to what you’re seeing today, you’re watching a much more focused and aggressive president.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He added: “He’s taking the lessons from his first term and delivering bigger results, faster results for the American people.”</p><p>So far, the upheaval caused by Mr. Trump’s early moves has not appeared to have brought a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">large shift in public opinion</a> against him, though it remains to be seen how the spending freezes and cuts to the federal work force will resonate among his key constituencies once the impacts are clear.</p><p>“Most of the people that voted for him wanted change,” Mr. Engel said. “I would argue most of the people that voted for him were not really into the weeds of Page 632 of federal law. So the headlines are, ‘Trump did something’ and they sense action.’”</p><p>The blitz of policy changes Mr. Trump has undertaken during his first month in office have little precedent, historians say.</p><p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a similar flurry of activity during his first 100 days in office, but those measures aimed to build up American institutions, not tear them down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“In Roosevelt’s case, that was a revolution to create institutions,” Mr. Engel said. “This is not a construction site. It’s a wrecking ball.”</p><p>Unlike with other presidents, there appear to be few checks on Mr. Trump.</p><p>Congress, under Republican control, has cast off its traditional oversight and budgetary roles in deference to his agenda.</p><p>Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/johnson-congress-power-trump.html" title="">said</a> Tuesday that he is all too happy to cede the power of the purse to Musk’s team in the executive branch. He indicated he has no objection to Mr. Trump canceling or clawing back funds approved by Congress.</p><p>“I’ve been asked so many times, ‘Aren’t you uncomfortable with this?’” Mr. Johnson told reporters. “No, I’m not.” He added: “We the people are applauding what’s happening in the new administration.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Members of the American Federation of Government Employees union gathered next to the U.S. Capitol building to protest funding cuts by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, in Washington on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Samuel Corum for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>One of the few Republicans in Congress who has not moved in lock step with Mr. Trump has been Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/rfk-jr-hhs-senate-confirmation.html" title="">declined to vote</a> for some of the president’s more polarizing Cabinet nominees. But the former party leader’s “no” votes have not held back the confirmations of figures such as Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Where Mr. Trump had encountered resistance, it has been in the courts. Some federal judges have stepped in to block temporarily some of Mr. Trump’s actions — including his attempted repeal of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/trump-birthright-citizenship-legal-immigrant-workers.html" title="">birthright citizenship</a>, his freeze on foreign aid and some of Mr. Musk’s intrusions into the federal government.</p><p>That has drawn Mr. Trump’s ire.</p><p>“Billions of Dollars of FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE, has already been found in the investigation of our incompetently run Government,” the president posted on Truth Social, without providing evidence of specific misspending. “Now certain activists and highly political judges want us to slow down, or stop. “Losing this momentum will be very detrimental to finding the TRUTH, which is turning out to be a disaster for those involved in running our Government. Much left to find. No Excuses!!!”</p><p>In some ways, Mr. Trump has adopted the philosophy of Silicon Valley and embraced by business executives such as his ally Mr. Musk, who has been slashing jobs and agencies at record pace: Move fast and break things.</p><p>Federal officials who have been pushed out in Mr. Trump’s rapid purges say he is systematically eroding any checks on his administration. He pushed out 19 inspectors general; the chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission; the head of the Office of Special Counsel, a government watchdog agency, and the chairwoman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects civil servants from unjustified disciplinary action. Many of those terminations are now being challenged in court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Cathy Harris, the chairwoman of the merit board, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-fires-government-employees.html" title="">sued to get her job back</a>, arguing her firing was illegal. She sees a pattern in how Mr. Trump is removing those who could hold him accountable.</p><p>“He’s taking widespread actions intended to gut the civil service,” Ms. Harris said. “The M.S.P.B. is one of the agencies that protects against actions taken against the civil service for partisan political reasons or other improper motives, and by diminishing the bipartisan nature of the board, I’m very fearful of what will happen to the civil service as a result.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Luke Broadwater covers Congress with a focus on congressional investigations.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater">More about Luke Broadwater</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/15/us/politics/trump-foreign-policy-government-firings.html">55</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/02/15/us/politics/trump-foreign-policy-government-firings.html">55</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>JD Vance:</strong> In Munich, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html">the vice president urged European leaders to end the isolation of far-right parties</a>, embracing a political movement with which the Trump administration shares a common approach on migration, identity and internet speech. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/vance-far-right-germany-munich-afd.html">It is a message he has long promoted</a> in the U.S.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obamacare:</strong> The administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/trump-obamacare-navigators.html">said it would drastically cut annual spending on so-called navigator groups</a> that help Americans enroll in health insurance plans, from around $100 million to just $10 million.</p></li><li><p><strong>Project 2025:</strong> The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/us/politics/project-2025-trump-actions.html">found more than 60 major moves made by the administration in its first 23 days</a> that align with proposals in the right-wing blueprint for overhauling the government.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘The Boss of Everyone and Everything’: </strong>President Trump is increasingly trying to enforce his will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-influence.html">on areas like the arts, sports, news, private companies and college campuses</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Justice Dept.
