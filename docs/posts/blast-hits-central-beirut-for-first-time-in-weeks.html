    <h1>Blast Hits Central Beirut for First Time in Weeks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Um Ahmad, who gave only her first name, stood across from the building, her three young daughters huddled behind her. She said that she, her husband and their six children were staying in a nearby apartment along with dozens of others displaced by the war. The moment they heard the blast, they rushed out of their building in fear.</p><p>“We heard a loud boom and left immediately,” she said.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military about the strike in Beirut. Earlier Sunday, the Israeli military said it had conducted “intelligence-based strikes” against Hezbollah on the Dahiya, an area just south of Beirut where the militant group holds sway. The Dahiya has come under bombardment in recent days. A spokesman for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, said on Sunday that Israel had struck 50 targets in the area over the past week.</p><p>Abu Hussein had fled the Dahiya and taken a job as a security guard at a building in Beirut a few weeks ago. The building where he works was the one that was hit on Sunday.</p><p>After the strike, Mr. Hussein stood nearby in a daze. His head bandaged, and streaks of blood ran down his neck.</p><p>“The building was nearly empty” when the strike hit, Mr. Hussein said, as medics tended to his wounds.</p></div></div>
