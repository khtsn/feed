Today, its reported breakthroughs prompted the erasure of hundreds of billions of dollars in market value from some of the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>Last week, DeepSeek explained how its new A.I. system could match the capabilities of cutting-edge chatbots from Google and OpenAI at a fraction of the cost. That revelation forced many investors to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html" title="">reassess their sky-high valuations</a> of American tech giants.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.5 percent, the Nasdaq dropped 3 percent and Nvidia, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/deepseek-nvidia-ai-chips.html" title="">chipmaker hailed as an A.I. sensation</a>, dropped about 17 percent and lost roughly $600 billion in market value.</p><p>Jason Karaian, our deputy Business editor, said that analysts considered DeepSeek’s emergence to be a “slap in the face” for investors who believed the A.I. race had already picked its winners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump in Las Vegas last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7da7c19f">In a clash with Colombia, Trump showed his use of U.S. power</h2><p>President Trump did not host any Situation Room meetings before threatening yesterday to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/americas/colombia-us-deportation-flights.html" title="">impose steep tariffs on Colombia</a>, a top U.S. ally in Latin America. Instead, he used his own social media network and his willingness to wield the American economy as a weapon in an effort to persuade Colombia’s president to accept military deportation flights.</p><p>It worked: President Gustavo Petro backed down, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/trump-colombia-tariffs-deportation-flights.html" title="">Trump emerged with real evidence that his tariff threats could help</a> him achieve his political goals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Holocaust survivor at the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kacper Pempel/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3ea6dd45">Auschwitz ceremonies were held with the far right rising</h2><p>Dozens of world leaders joined a group of fewer than 50 Nazi death camp survivors in Poland today to commemorate the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/europe/auschwitz-liberation-80th-anniversary.html" title="">80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz</a>, where more than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were murdered.</p><p>The remembrance comes as Germany and the rest of Europe experience a rise in hard-right politics that is widely viewed as an echo of the nationalism that brought Hitler to power in the 1930s. Over the weekend, Elon Musk told Germany’s rising far-right party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), that the country had “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/europe/musk-germany-afd-auschwitz.html" title="">too much of a focus on past guilt</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bird flu has infected more than 900 herds of dairy cattle and dozens of people, killing one.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Natalie Behring/Getty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-628efc75">Bird flu has entered a new phase</h2><p>“It’s time to take the bird flu seriously,” our science reporter Apoorva Mandavilli said.</p><p>A pandemic is not inevitable, scientists say.
