    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><header><p id="article-summary">The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 10.1 percent from its recent high, crossing a threshold that signals investors have turned pessimistic about stocks.</p><p><time datetime="2025-03-13T16:33:53-04:00">March 13, 2025, <span>4:33 p.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Stocks have tumbled in recent weeks as investors have grappled with President Trump’s back and forth on tariffs as well as concerns about the American economy. On Thursday, the sell-off pushed the S&amp;P 500 stock index into a correction, a Wall Street term for a significant decline from a recent high.</p><p>Investors, who previously thought Mr. Trump’s more extreme tariff threats were mostly a negotiating tool, have started to worry that they may have been too blasé about the risks. Uncertainty about which tariffs will ultimately be imposed — and their potential economic effects — has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/stock-market-economy-tariffs-recession.html?smid=url-share" title="">jolted markets around the world</a>.</p><h2 id="link-fa2b41b">What constitutes a market correction?</h2><p>A correction is a drop of 10 percent or more in stocks from their most recent high. Since its Feb. 19 peak, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 10.1 percent.</p><p>The 10 percent trigger for a correction is an arbitrary, round-number threshold. But it serves as a signal that investors have turned pointedly more pessimistic about the market. That is particularly the case for technology stocks, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index down almost 14 percent from its most recent peak, in mid-December.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-31a5d6b1">Are market corrections common?</h2><p>This is the 13th correction in the S&amp;P 500 since the turn of the century, according to data from Yardeni Research. Of the 12 previous corrections, four turned into bear markets, defined as a more severe decline of at least 20 percent:</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="datawrapper_NfYH1" data-id="100000008172930" data-source-id="100000008172930"><div slug="datawrapper_NfYH1" data-sourceid="100000008172930" id="embed-id-100000008172930">

Others can be more drawn out, generally when they develop into full-fledged bear markets.</p><p>That said, one previous bear market, at the start of the pandemic, was severe but relatively short — it erased about 33 percent in value from stocks in just over a month. Less than three months later, stocks had regained their previous peak.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How Altman Won Over Trump: </strong>After helping President Trump get elected, Elon Musk was poised to dominate America’s A.I. policies.
