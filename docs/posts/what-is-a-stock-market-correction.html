    <h1>What Is a Stock Market Correction?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stocks have tumbled in recent weeks as investors have grappled with President Trump’s back and forth on tariffs as well as concerns about the American economy. On Thursday, the sell-off pushed the S&amp;P 500 stock index into a correction, a Wall Street term for a significant decline from a recent high.</p><p>Investors, who previously thought Mr. Trump’s more extreme tariff threats were mostly a negotiating tool, have started to worry that they may have been too blasé about the risks. Uncertainty about which tariffs will ultimately be imposed — and their potential economic effects — has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/stock-market-economy-tariffs-recession.html?smid=url-share" title="">jolted markets around the world</a>.</p><h2 id="link-fa2b41b">What constitutes a market correction?</h2><p>A correction is a drop of 10 percent or more in stocks from their most recent high.

But it serves as a signal that investors have turned pointedly more pessimistic about the market. That is particularly the case for technology stocks, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index down almost 14 percent from its most recent peak, in mid-December.</p></div></div>
