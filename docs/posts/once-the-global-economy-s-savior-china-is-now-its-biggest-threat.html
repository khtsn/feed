It paid off at first. China voraciously consumed Venezuelan oil and financed infrastructure projects from a high-speed railway to power plants.</p><p>The 2010s brought a reckoning. Oil prices fell, and growth in Chinese oil demand slowed along with its economy. Venezuela’s oil export revenues plummeted, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/VEN/background" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from more than $73 billion in 2011 to $22 billion in 2016</a>. Misrule by Mr. Chavez and his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, and myriad other domestic problems already had Venezuela on the brink; the gamble on China helped push it over the edge. In 2014, Venezuela’s economy collapsed. People scavenged for food in garbage dumps, hospitals were short of essential medicines and crime surged. Since then, nearly <a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/news/venezuela-crisis-explained/#:~:text=People%20are%20fleeing%20Venezuela%20in,homes%20in%20search%20of%20safety." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eight million people</a> have fled the country. China largely <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/chinas-support-for-the-maduro-regime-enduring-or-fleeting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cut Venezuela off from new credit</a> and <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/china-venezuela-economic-relations-hedging-venezuelan-bets-chinese-characteristics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">loans</a>, leaving behind a slew of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/venezuela-china-food/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unfinished projects</a>.</p><p>Venezuela’s over-dependence on China was an early warning that the world ignored. <a href="https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/2024/01/30/how-dependent-are-emerging-market-economies-on-china-s-growth" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dozens</a> of other <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/22/what-chinas-economic-troubles-mean-for-the-world" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">countries</a> that rode China’s rise are now at serious <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/11/09/cf-chinas-slowing-economy-will-hit-sub-saharan-africas-growth" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">risk</a> of financial distress and debt default as the Chinese economy stagnates.

Starting in 2008, it <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-financial-challenges-and-us-interests" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pumped $29 trillion</a> into its economy over nine years — equivalent to about one-third of global G.D.P. — to keep it going. The positive ripple effects were felt worldwide: From 2008 to 2021 China accounted for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/23/opinion/columnists/what-can-replace-china-as-a-global-economic-engine.html" title="">more than 40 percent of global growth</a>. Developing countries eagerly attached themselves to what seemed like an unstoppable economic juggernaut, and China became the top trading partner for most of the world’s nations. Like Venezuela, many discovered that the booming Chinese economy was a lucrative new market for their commodity exports, and they leaned heavily into that, allowing other sectors of their economies to languish.</p></div></div><div><p>China also lent more than $1 trillion abroad, largely for infrastructure projects to be built by Chinese companies under its Belt and Road Initiative. Over the past two decades, <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/inroads-and-outposts-critical-infrastructure-in-chinas-africa-strategy-introduction/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one in three infrastructure projects in Africa</a> was built by Chinese entities. The long-term debt risks for fragile developing economies were often ignored.</p></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="beckley-china-lending" data-id="100000009632614" data-source-id="100000009632614"><div data-sourceid="100000009632614" id="embed-id-100000009632614">

But the country is making things worse at a delicate moment. It has <a href="https://www.bu.edu/gdp/chinas-overseas-development-finance/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drastically cut overseas lending</a> and is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/06/china-worlds-biggest-debt-collector-as-poorer-nations-struggle-with-its-loans#:~:text=8%20months%20old-,China%20&#39;world&#39;s%20biggest%20debt%20collector&#39;%20as%20poorer,nations%20struggle%20with%20its%20loans&amp;text=China%20has%20become%20the%20world&#39;s,according%20to%20a%20new%20report." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">squeezing strapped developing nations</a> to repay their existing loans. Rather than offer real debt relief, China typically extends short-term <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31105" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">credit swaps and loan rollovers</a>.</p><p>Zambia and Sri Lanka defaulted on billions in debt owed to international creditors in 2020 and 2022, respectively. In both cases, an explosion of Chinese loans and credit was a significant factor in pushing those countries into deep financial trouble. This led to <a href="https://www.biznews.com/africa/2024/06/04/zambia-13-4bn-debt-deal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debt restructuring negotiations</a> that were difficult and protracted partly because of the opaque nature of Chinese lending practices, <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/07/sri-lankas-debt-restructuring-deal-economic-relief-or-creditor-windfall/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exacerbating</a> both countries’ crises. Eventually, Zambia and Sri Lanka were forced to extend repayment periods, meaning that resources that could have been spent on economic recovery went to servicing debt obligations. The extended uncertainty has made it difficult for these countries to access new financing.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have warned that dozens of countries across the developing world — many of which have close trade relationships with China — now face some form of <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-global-debt-crisis-and-role-international-aid" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debt distress</a>.

The heavy debt has hammered Laos’s currency, making it more difficult for the country to service its debt and forcing it to cede some of its economic sovereignty as repayment, including allowing China to take <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/laos-debt-china-belt-road/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ownership stakes</a> in its <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/07/is-laos-planning-to-sell-off-more-of-its-energy-sector-to-china/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">power grid</a>.</p><p>Even some wealthy nations such as Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, face deep challenges because of their <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-china-strategy-needs-be-updated-econ-minister-says-2024-06-21/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over-dependence</a> on doing business with China.
