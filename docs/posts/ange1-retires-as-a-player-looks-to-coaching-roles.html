That all changed in 2022, when ANGE1 led FPX through their historic lower bracket run in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1014/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-copenhagen" target="_blank">Masters Copenhagen</a> to win his first VCT trophy.</p>

<em>ANGE1 is the oldest player to win an international event, claiming his trophy at age 32.</em></p>

<p>Heading into the partnership leagues in 2023, ANGE1 stuck with the core of FPX as they <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/156001/navi-acquire-funplus-phoenix-roster-cned" target="_blank">migrated</a> to NAVI. Early on, they maintained their status as a top team in EMEA, but struggled to make an impact on the international stage. Even <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/276829/ardiis-departs-nrg-reunites-with-emea-under-navi" target="_blank">reuniting</a> the full masters-winning team in 2024, their days of glory had passed, as they failed to qualify to any international events in the year.</p>

<p>In 2025, ANGE1 was given a fresh crop of young talent to foster, as NAVI underwent a <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/426882/navi-picks-up-hiro-koalanoob-and-ruxic-happy-as-head-coach" target="_blank">rebuild</a>. They struggled early in the year, but were strong contenders by the end of the season. In the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2498/vct-2025-emea-stage-2/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 2 playoffs</a>, they made their deepest run of the year, reaching the top four by <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530931/team-heretics-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr2" target="_blank">upsetting</a> <span data-ref-id="3">

<p>In CS it&#39;s not even that unusual and some of the best teams still have 30+ years old players, but in Valorant it&#39;s def. not the standard.</p>
