Investigators later located human remains that they believe could belong to the missing man. The police did not identify the people who had been detained or the victim.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The police described the pair as “alleged perpetrators of a crime of aggravated illegal detention” and said they would face charges in the victim’s disappearance and in his death.</p><p>“Among the clues that the investigators had to solve the crime, though they were not necessarily the decisive ones, were some images that they detected during the investigations” on Google Maps, the police said in their release.</p><p>The man had been reported missing in November 2023 by a relative who told the police that they had been in regular contact by phone, the authorities said.</p><p>After a period of silence, the relative began receiving suspicious messages from the man’s phone number, the police said. The messages claimed that he had met a woman and moved away from Soria, they added.</p><p>“All of this made the person who reported the crime become suspicious that the messages had not been sent by the missing man, and as a result, they decided to make it known to the National Police,” the authorities said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The missing man was originally from Cuba and had gone to the small town of <a href="https://www.tajueco.es/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tajueco</a>, in the province of Soria, to visit a romantic partner, <a href="https://elpais.com/espana/2024-12-18/cazado-por-google-maps-en-una-aldea-de-soria-la-foto-de-un-hombre-metiendo-un-bulto-en-su-maletero-clave-para-esclarecer-un-asesinato.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the newspaper El País</a>, which described the relative who went to the police as the victim’s cousin. El País said the victim was a 33-year-old man whom it identified only by his initials, J.L.P.O.</p><p>Investigators zeroed in on the two people who were ultimately arrested, and they obtained authorization to search their homes and visually inspect their cars, police said.</p><p>The police did not specify when exactly investigators had obtained the image captured by Google, which shows a man in jeans standing behind a red car, with his hands on a bulky white package that looks roughly the size of a human body, or whether they had found it using the publicly available search tool on Google Maps, known as Street View.</p><p>On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the National Police limited her comments to confirming the source of the image. “It’s true,” she said, adding, “The image was not the key to solving the case.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Google said the company cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.</p><p>After the two had been detained, investigators focused on finding the missing man, the police said, which resulted in the discovery of a human torso that had been buried at a cemetery in Soria. The police said the remains, which <a href="https://x.com/policia/status/1869315636335136965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1869315636335136965%7Ctwgr%5Eba3303e4547dd44775c63626d8242f7d7231aea4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felpais.com%2Fespana%2F2024-12-18%2Fcazado-por-google-maps-en-una-aldea-de-soria-la-foto-de-un-hombre-metiendo-un-bulto-en-su-maletero-clave-para-esclarecer-un-asesinato.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were recovered on Dec. 11</a>, had been turned over to a forensic team.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is not the first time Google Maps has played a role in helping criminal investigators crack a case. In 2022, the Italian authorities used Google Maps and Street View to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/world/europe/italian-mafia-fugitive-google-maps.html" title="">help them track down</a> a Sicilian man who had been convicted of murder and was on Italy’s list of most dangerous fugitives. He, too, was found in Spain.</p><p>While Google Maps has played a role in helping law enforcement officials solve crimes, the company’s camera-equipped Street View cars have also raised privacy concerns and angered some people.</p><p>In 2016, a man in Oakland, Calif., was charged with attacking several Google Street View vehicles because he believed they were surveilling him. In one case, a criminal complaint said, he threw beer bottles at a vehicle, causing the area under the vehicle to burst into flames.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Turning Allies Into Enemies: </strong>The United States killed its own allies in Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/europe/afghanistan-allies-enemies-nuristan-taliban.html">sabotaging itself in a part of the country</a> where it never needed to be.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Drives Both Sides in Sudan’s War: </strong>Famine and ethnic cleansing stalk Sudan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/africa/sudan-gold-rush-heart-civil-war.html">Yet the gold trade is booming</a>, enriching generals and propelling the fight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reining In Argentina’s Inflation: </strong>President Javier Milei has been praised inside and outside Argentina for taming the world’s highest inflation rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html">But his policies have inflicted widespread hardship</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nudging Japan Forward: </strong>In a society used to quiet consensus-building, Tokyo has made bold changes to its defense policy.
