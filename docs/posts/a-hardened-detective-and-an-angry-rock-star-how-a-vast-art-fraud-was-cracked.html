The fakes, which included rebranded paintings by Mr. Tait and other Indigenous artists, made it onto the walls of the country’s top <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-massive-norval-morrisseau-art-fraud-hits-winnipegs-leading-gallery-wag/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">galleries</a> and <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-mcgill-norval-morrisseau-fraud-investigation/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universities</a>. They were purchased by retired <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-factions-square-off-over-morrisseau/article4226038/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">schoolteachers</a>, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/article-victims-of-alleged-morrisseau-art-fraud-include-westerkirk-capital/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">billionaire art collectors</a> and even a <a href="https://kevinhearn.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rock star</a>.</p><p>The leaders of the Thunder Bay rings have pleaded guilty to fraud in the past year and are now imprisoned. Thunder Bay — an isolated city on Lake Superior’s north shore that drug dealers from Toronto have turned into Canada’s <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/241211/t003a-eng.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">homicide capital</a> — has also emerged as the epicenter of the biggest art fraud in the country’s history.</p><p>The convictions came a quarter-century after the authenticity of many Morrisseaus was first publicly questioned — and only after a series of unusual events linking the rock star; a cold-case murder of a teenager; his aging, grieving parents; and the hard-boiled homicide detectives initially skeptical of art fraud. The detectives ended up mastering the finer points of Morrisseau’s Woodlands style of art.</p><p>“None of us knew anything about art,” Det. Jason Rybak of the Thunder Bay Police Service said during a recent drive through the city, whose muted colors were further drained by fresh snow and a cloud-filled sky.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Det. Jason Rybak of the Thunder Bay Police Service, the lead investigator on the fraud around Morrisseau’s art.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Recalling the first raid of a ringleader’s house, Detective Rybak, who led the investigation, said: “Next thing you know, we have these paintings. And we’re like, ‘Oh yeah, what now?’”</p><p>The police knew of Morrisseau, though. A member of the Ojibwe First Nation, he was born on a reserve northeast of Thunder Bay. But Morrisseau had long been a fixture on the city’s streets where he hawked his artwork.</p><p>Morrisseau became famous for creating the Woodland School of painting, a fusion of Ojibwe and European styles. His paintings touched on Indigenous beliefs, depicting people, animals and the physical and spiritual worlds in bright colors and X-ray-like motifs.</p><p>Canada’s artistic establishment had long considered works by Indigenous artists to be ethnography, not fine art. But Morrisseau’s work changed that starting in the 1960s, as it earned acclaim in Toronto, the United States and France, where he became known as the Picasso of the North.</p><p>In 2006, a year before his death at 75, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/canada/canada-art-museums-colonialism.html" title="">National Gallery of Canada</a>, the country’s most important museum, held a retrospective of Morrisseau’s art — the first time a contemporary Indigenous artist was given such a spotlight. But the homage was marred by news reports of the proliferation of suspected knockoffs. Morrisseau himself had spoken out against the fraud and identified fakes with his forged signature.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The stories never led anywhere because gallery owners, auctioneers and others with a financial stake in counterfeit Morrisseaus fiercely denied the existence of widespread fraud, said Jonathan Sommer, a lawyer who represented three people who sued galleries for selling them counterfeits.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Thunder Bay, on the shores of Lake Superior.

But one client happened to be a rock star: Kevin Hearn, the keyboardist for the <a href="https://www.barenakedladies.com/news/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barenaked Ladies</a>, a Canadian band that has sold more than 15 million albums.</p><p>Mr. Hearn, a onetime choirboy, loved “the bold colors and the black lines” in the paintings of Morrisseau, whose work was influenced by stained-glass church windows. In 2005, he bought a painting of animals in a circle on a green canvas called, “Spirit Energy of Mother Earth,” paying 20,000 Canadian dollars, about $16,500 at the time, at a Toronto gallery that reassured him of its authenticity.</p><p>After learning a few years later that it was a fake, Mr. Hearn successfully sued the gallery even as he weathered online attacks from people at risk of losing financially by the exposing of sham Morrisseaus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I was scared for my family,” Mr. Hearn said in an interview. “They were posting photos of my special-needs daughter online saying that I was a bad father for pursuing this litigation.”</p><p>Mr. Hearn also backed the making of a documentary, “There Are No Fakes,” on the broader fraud involving Morrisseau.</p><p>“I feel like the relationship between an artist’s work and the people that take that work into their heart is sacred,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mac Vajdani, the owner of Max Pawn and Loans in Thunder Lake, with an original Morrisseau painting.

When the detective called Mr. Hearn and his lawyer, Mr. Sommer, he was focused on the cold case and showed little interest in the fake Morrisseaus, Mr. Sommer said. But that changed when the detective became aware of the potentially strong case against Mr. Lamont — for art fraud.</p><p>“Once he got it,” Mr. Sommer said, “he became like a pit bull.”</p><p>Detective Rybak and two colleagues, Det. Sean Verescak and Det. Kevin Bradley, said they carried out their investigation by reconstructing Morrisseau’s life so they could understand how and what he painted, and how he signed his works.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Detectives Shawn Verescak, left, and Kevin Bradley behind a warehouse that was used to store paintings falsely sold as works by Morrisseau.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Morrisseau, who was sexually abused at the Roman Catholic residential school he was sent to at 6, according to biographies, battled alcoholism for most of his life and, at one point, was homeless in Vancouver.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“He had lots of demons,” Detective Rybak said.</p><p>After his international success, Morrisseau returned to Thunder Bay in the 1970s.</p><p>It was a blue-collar town where people worked at paper mills and grain elevators. Toronto was a 16-hour drive, a place children visited for the first time on eighth-grade field trips. Few in Thunder Bay were aware of Morrisseau’s accomplishments. Locals knew him simply as the Indigenous artist who milled around downtown offering his drawings outside a bank in exchange for money, food or alcohol.</p><p>During one winter storm, Peter Kantola was driving when Morrisseau appeared out of nowhere and flagged him down. The artist had his hands deep in the pockets of a flimsy jacket.</p><p>“He was half frozen, the snow was blasting his whole face,” recalled Mr. Kantola, 84, a retired high school science teacher.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peter Kantola with his original paintings by Morrisseau.

Morrisseau, Mr. Kantola said, gave him two large paintings that now grace his living room.</p><p>Morrisseau also befriended Gary Lamont, the future art-fraud ringleader, in the 1970s, according to Mr. Lamont’s guilty plea statement. During the course of their friendship, Mr. Lamont occasionally set up Morrisseau in an apartment and covered the rent.</p><p>Mr. Lamont’s longtime partner, Linda Tkachyk, would take money, food and alcohol to the artist, her niece Amanda Dalby recalled. Ms. Dalby, 40, lived with her aunt and Mr. Lamont when she was a child.</p><p>On one visit, Morrisseau gave Ms. Dalby and her sister a painting.</p><p>“He said it would be enough to pay for our schooling,” Ms. Dalby said, adding that Mr. Lamont later took it.</p><p>According to Mr. Lamont’s guilty plea, he started producing counterfeit Morrisseaus in 2002 and continued until 2015. He was sentenced last December to five years in prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>In the house where Ms. Dalby stayed, Indigenous artists, including a nephew of Morrisseau’s, painted nonstop inside a tiny room that Mr. Lamont kept locked, she said.</p><p>According to his guilty plea, Mr. Lamont also traded money and marijuana for paintings by Mr. Tait — the local artist who vowed to sing like a bird and helped expose Mr. Lamont. Mr. Tait stopped supplying him with paintings after realizing they were being passed off as Morrisseaus.</p><p>“He took advantage of me pretty bad,” Mr. Tait said one recent evening as he painted on a large canvas, his granddaughter bounding around their apartment. “That was my biggest weakness, drugs. I’m not like that anymore — 20 years in August.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Tait and his granddaughter in his apartment in Thunder Bay.

Under its leader, a housepainter named David Voss, fake Morrisseaus were made in assembly-line fashion with Mr. Voss sketching outlines that were colored in by multiple individuals, each responsible for a single hue. Mr. Voss pleaded guilty to fraud in June. The case of a third ring, based in southern Ontario, is still working its way through the courts.</p><p>According to the detectives, Mr. Lamont used drugs and alcohol to turn Indigenous artists into Morrisseau forgers.</p><p>Gil Labine, Mr. Lamont’s lawyer, said his client was not a drug dealer, though he supplied the Indigenous artists with drugs. Mr. Labine added that Mr. Lamont has denied any involvement in the 1984 murder.</p><p>The artists regularly showed up at the arts supply shop in town, the Painted Turtle, to pick up large orders for Mr. Lamont, said the owner, Lorraine Cull.</p><p>Late one December, Mr. Lamont showed up with four young men.</p><p>“He almost cleaned us out of all the canvases we had,” Ms. Cull said. “I asked him, ‘What are you doing with all this?’ And he said they were Christmas gifts for all the artists up North.”</p><p>“And it was after Christmas.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lorraine Cull, the owner of the Painted Turtle, an art supply store in Thunder Bay.
