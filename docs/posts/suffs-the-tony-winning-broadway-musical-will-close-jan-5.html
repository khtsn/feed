At the time of its closing, it will have had 24 previews and 301 regular performances. The show announced plans for a national tour, which will begin in Seattle’s in September 2025.</p><p>The musical, which takes place in the early 20th century, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/theater/shaina-taub-suffs-public-theater.html?smid=url-share" title="">depicts two generations of women</a> eager to win the right to vote, but divided over how best to do that. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/theater/shaina-taub-elton-john-twelfth-night.html?smid=url-share" title="">Shaina Taub</a>, a singer-songwriter, wrote the book and score and stars as Alice Paul, an influential suffragist. It was directed by Leigh Silverman.</p><p>The show began previews on March 26 and opened on April 18 at the Music Box Theater. A pre-Broadway production at the Public Theater received <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/theater/suffs-review-public-theater.html?smid=url-share" title="">reviews</a> that were <a href="https://didtheylikeit.com/shows/suffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mixed</a>; the reviews of the Broadway production were somewhat <a href="https://didtheylikeit.com/shows/suffs-bway/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">better</a>. Writing in The New York Times, the chief theater critic Jesse Green <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/theater/suffs-review-broadway-shaina-taub.html?smid=url-share" title="">called it</a> “a good show and good for the world” but said “to be great, a musical (like a great movement) must grab you by the throat. ‘Suffs’ too often settles for holding up signs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The show’s grosses have been middling — during the week that ended Oct. 6, it grossed $679,589, which is generally not sufficient to sustain a large-cast musical.</p><p>“Suffs” is the sixth musical to announce closing dates since early May, following “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/theater/lempicka-broadway-closing.html?smid=url-share" title="">Lempicka</a>,” “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/theater/huey-lewis-broadway-closing.html?smid=url-share" title="">The Heart of Rock and Roll</a>,” “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/theater/tommy-revival-broadway-closing.html?pvid=AbS2Tk0Jkc81PeQVdELrfpgd&amp;smid=url-share" title="">The Who’s Tommy</a>,” “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/theater/notebook-broadway-closing.html?smid=url-share" title="">The Notebook</a>” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/theater/water-elephants-broadway-closing.html" title="">“Water for Elephants.”</a> Broadway is always a difficult industry, and most shows fail, but the odds of success are particularly long now because production costs have risen, audience size has fallen, and a high volume of shows are competing for attention.</p><p>“Suffs,” with Jill Furman and Rachel Sussman as lead producers, was capitalized for $19 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That money has not been recouped.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
