Trump, is taking over policy planning for the transition and is expected to be named deputy chief of staff in the incoming administration, according to people briefed on the matter.</p><p>It remains to be seen how broad Mr. Miller’s portfolio will be, but it is expected to be vast and to far exceed what the eventual title will convey, according to the people briefed on the matter.</p><p>A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Miller also did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p><p>Mr. Miller’s views are favored by Mr. Trump’s hard-line base. Vice President-elect JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr., who has been influential in the transition, <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1856010089267605940" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">praised the prospective choice on X</a>, the website formerly known as Twitter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The expected move was reported earlier by CNN.</p><p>Mr. Miller was an influential aide in Mr. Trump’s first term, and has remained a key adviser and speechwriter. He has been involved in Mr. Trump’s early transition planning meetings since their election victory last Tuesday, and Mr. Miller is expected to play a key role in staffing the government — especially regarding roles that intersect with immigration policy.</p><p>While many former Trump aides made themselves scarce after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Mr. Miller stayed close to Mr. Trump immediately after he left office. He advised his team on messaging and policy and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/politics/stephen-miller-america-first-legal.html" title="">formed his own nonprofit group, America First Legal Foundation</a>, to battle the Biden administration in the courts. He has been a frequent presence on Fox News defending Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Miller traveled with Mr. Trump during the campaign and encouraged Mr. Trump’s instincts to elevate immigration as the top issue in the closing weeks of the race.</p><p>Over the past two years, Mr. Miller has also been working on detailed plans for mass deportations. He outlined these and other hard-line immigration policies in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">interview with The New York Times last year</a>. The plans include restricting legal and illegal immigration in a number of ways, including rounding up undocumented immigrants already in the United States and detaining them in camps before they’re expelled from the country.</p><p>A handful of other people from the top of Mr. Trump’s campaign ranks are expected to be among the deputy chiefs of staff announced as soon as Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Miller is expected to work closely with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-homan-immigration-border.html" title="">Thomas D. Homan</a>, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whom the president-elect named Sunday as his “czar” to the police and to control the borders.</p><p>Mr. Trump said Mr. Homan would also oversee the planned deportations of immigrants residing illegally in the United States, as well as the nation’s maritime and aviation security.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
