But she cut off her monitor and made her way to upstate New York, where she rode a bus toward the Canadian border, the official said.</p><p>Ms. Dali had a ticket for that ride, the official said, unlike the flight to Paris.

During the seven-hour flight, Ms. Dali tried to avoid notice by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/europe/stowaway-return-cdg-jfk-airport.html" title="">ducking into the aircraft’s bathrooms</a>.</p><p>Delta returned Ms. Dali to Kennedy after she had spent about a week in the custody of French authorities.
