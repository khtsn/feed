He joined their weekly closed-door meeting and made it clear that he saw the legislation as a test of loyalty to him.</p><p>Anyone who voted against the package “wouldn’t be a Republican much longer,” the president declared. He used profanity-laden language to scold a faction of the party that wanted to use the bill to change Medicaid, and he singled out at least two lawmakers who had held out support.</p><p>However, it quickly became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-big-beautiful-bill.html" title="">clear to my colleagues reporting on Capitol Hill that Trump had secured few, if any, converts</a>. “The president, I don’t think, convinced enough people that the bill is adequate the way that it is,” said Andy Harris, a Republican and the leader of the House Freedom Caucus. Many other Republicans agreed that they had not been sold.</p><p>Now, it’s up to Speaker Mike Johnson to find enough votes to pass the legislation. Johnson said he intended to do so by the end of the week, but holdouts with different regional and ideological interests could imperil his efforts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Northern Gaza, today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6761798a">Israel’s allies told it to stop its expanded Gaza offensive</h2><p>Britain announced today that it was suspending trade talks with Israel over its plan to expand the war in Gaza and its blockade of humanitarian aid.
