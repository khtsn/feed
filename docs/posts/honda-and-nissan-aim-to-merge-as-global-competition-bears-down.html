Over the next six months, the companies will discuss combining their operations under a holding company, with the goal of completing the merger in August 2026.</p><p>Honda and Nissan, Japan’s second- and third-largest automakers, would join a growing number of legacy auto giants, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/gm-china.html" title="">General Motors</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/business/volkswagen-union-deal-germany.html" title="">Volkswagen</a>, that are deepening ties to share the financial burden of developing next-generation vehicles. The deal is seen as a lifeline in particular for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/nissan-job-cuts.html" title="">Nissan</a>, which has been slashing jobs and production amid faltering sales.</p><p>Unlike the gasoline-powered cars that have defined the industry for most of the past century, more vehicles today are being equipped with batteries, electric motors and advanced software that enable features such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/business/china-driverless-cars.html" title="">autonomous driving</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To navigate the change, Honda and Nissan have decided they can better handle research and development and new investments as a combined force, Honda’s chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, said at a briefing in Tokyo on Monday.</p><p>“Current business models are being upended. It is not going to take 10 to 20 years for that to happen, it will come much faster,” Mr. Mibe said. “We need to have the right artillery in order to be competitive on that battlefield so we’re starting today,” he said.</p><p>In recent years, automakers across Japan, the United States and Europe have invested billions of dollars into electric vehicle development — efforts that, for the most part, have yet to generate profits. These investments are being financed by sales of higher-margin gasoline and hybrid models, which also require continuous investment.</p><p>With electric vehicle-sales growth slowing and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump gearing up to eliminate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/trump-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html" title="">E.V. tax incentives</a>, automakers must figure out how to sustain investments in gasoline and battery-powered cars for an extended period of time, said Takaki Nakanishi, head of the automotive consulting firm Nakanishi Research Institute in Tokyo.</p><p>“To sustain these dual investments, automakers need scale and the operational efficiencies that come with it,” Mr. Nakanishi said. “If Nissan and Honda are not able to achieve this, they will not survive,” he said. “Times are truly that tough.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Nissan sells more than 3 million vehicles a year, while Honda sells nearly 4 million. A merger would position them as the world’s third-largest automaker group, behind <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/business/toyota-ceo-succession.html" title="">Toyota</a>, whose brands sold 11 million vehicles last year, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/business/volkswagen-china.html" title="">Volkswagen</a>, which sold 9 million. Honda and Nissan together employ about 325,000 people.</p><p>Nissan and Honda said integrating their businesses would enable them to standardize the basic makeup of vehicles and increase production. Those steps would reduce how much each company spends on developing vehicles, freeing up cash to spend on things like creating new software.</p><p>The key question is whether even large, combined entities like Honda and Nissan can keep up with newer competitors. The American company Tesla and China’s BYD have already established a commanding lead in electric vehicles and car technologies that can be updated over the air like smartphones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Honda Ye GT electric vehicle at the Beijing auto show in April.

DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/business/stellantis-ceo-resigns.html" title="">Carlos Tavares</a>, resigned under pressure this month.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last year, Nissan and its longtime French partner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/business/nissan-renault-alliance-agreement.html" title="">Renault</a>, agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.</p><p>The new parent company of a merged Honda and Nissan would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Honda would nominate a majority of the new company’s directors, from among which a president will be selected. Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker and longtime partner of Nissan’s, said it would also consider joining the new group.</p><p>Under the automakers’ current market valuations, the combination would be worth more than $50 billion.</p><p>The deal is part of a wave of consolidation, which some argue is long overdue, taking place in the Japanese car industry. This year, there has been $10 billion in mergers and acquisitions in the sector, up 163 percent from a year earlier, according to Mergermarket, a data provider.</p><p>Even with expanded scale, the Japanese automakers will need to prove that their partnership can speed their development of new vehicles, said Tang Jin, a senior researcher at Mizuho Bank. If they cannot create some kind of “chemical reaction” of new value by coming together, he said, “their merging will simply become a gathering of the weak.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Already in China, the world’s largest car market, it may be too late for Honda, Nissan and many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/gm-china.html" title="">Western automakers</a> to make up ground lost to cost-competitive and technologically advanced local rivals. For the fiscal year ending March 31, Nissan has projected a 13 percent drop in its sales in China, while Honda expects an even steeper decline.</p><p>Nissan’s struggles in China contributed to a 90 percent plunge in its operating profit to $214 million during the first half of the current fiscal year. Last month, Nissan said it would make deep cuts to its global operations, and in the weeks since, it has been circled by a number of groups including activist investors.</p><p>Compared with Nissan, Honda’s financial position remains relatively healthy. Honda turned a $1.8 billion profit in the recent July-September quarter, but that was down 15 percent from a year earlier because of higher research-and-development costs and weak sales in China.</p><p>“Nissan’s current decline could very well be Honda’s tomorrow,” said Mr. Nakanishi, the industry consultant. That is something Honda recognizes. “It realizes its best shot is to combine with Nissan, share a common destiny and try to overcome the impending crisis together,” he said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
