    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Armed with a clipboard and campaign literature, Liz Minnella strolled through a neighborhood in New Hope, Pa., optimistic that by the end of her day of door-knocking, the small town would live up to its name for Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign.</p><p>There wasn’t a political yard sign in sight, which Ms. Minnella, who had only recently become a Democratic activist, took to mean that she might find some persuadable voters. When a blonde woman in a Villanova sweatshirt answered one door with a broad smile, Ms. Minnella, a Villanova graduate, thought aloud, “This is my lady.”</p><p>The woman, a 52-year-old Republican, was eager to talk, even though Ms. Minnella’s voter list had highlighted her daughter, an independent. Ms. Minnella tried to steer the conversation toward reproductive rights, but it eventually circled back to the woman’s fears that migrants would bring violent crime to her wealthy Philadelphia suburb. The woman thanked Ms. Minnella for the “civil conversation,” but her mind was unchanged — she was voting for former President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>The episode reflected the obstacles that white women who support Ms. Harris are confronting as they try to persuade their ideologically diverse counterparts to join her cause, an effort that could potentially decide the election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While much attention has focused on how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html" title="">Ms. Harris’s chances could be imperiled</a> by groups like Black men — the second-most loyal Democratic voters after Black women — pollsters and strategists say the race is more likely to come down to white women.</p><p>They are the country’s largest voting demographic, making up about 30 percent of the electorate, and they consistently turn out at very high rates. They tend to swing in larger numbers toward the Republican in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/white-women-gop/576586/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presidential elections</a> — including in the last two contests for Mr. Trump.</p><p>In the 2016 election, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">47 percent</a> of white women voted for Mr. Trump, compared with 45 percent for Hillary Clinton. Even more white women, 53 percent, favored Mr. Trump in 2020, versus 46 percent for Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/multimedia/31pol-harris-whitewomen-topart-wfjg/31pol-harris-whitewomen-topart-wfjg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/multimedia/31pol-harris-whitewomen-topart-wfjg/31pol-harris-whitewomen-topart-wfjg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/31/multimedia/31pol-harris-whitewomen-topart-wfjg/31pol-harris-whitewomen-topart-wfjg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A close-up picture of a woman’s wrist with a beaded bracelet, with Kamala Harris’s name visible on the beads.

Afterward, many Democrats <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dear-white-women-we-messed-this-up-election-2016_n_582341c9e4b0aac62488970e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blamed and shamed</a> them for stopping Mrs. Clinton from becoming the first female president.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The sting of Mrs. Clinton’s loss, and the familiar notes of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/trump-truth-social-posts.html" title="">sexism</a> (and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-harris-race.html" title="">racism</a>) that Ms. Harris has faced this election season — especially from Mr. Trump — have mobilized many left-leaning white women to try to prevent history from repeating itself.</p><p>“I can’t see her lose,” Caroline McCarthy Pompizzi, who was canvassing alongside Ms. Minnella, said of Ms. Harris. “It’s not just about her winning. It’s about living the next four years of the worst of America.”</p><p>As the country holds its first presidential election since the fall of Roe v. Wade, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/harris-trump-election-gender.html" title="">a widening gender gap</a> has again positioned white women as a potentially decisive swing vote. The two candidates are now neck-and-neck among white female voters, according to recent New York Times/Siena College polling, with Ms. Harris inching ahead slightly.</p><p>Like other groups, white women list the economy and inflation as their top concern: Twenty-nine percent said so, according to Times/Siena polling conducted this month. Close behind was abortion rights, with 24 percent identifying it as their No. 1 issue, followed by 14 percent who chose immigration.</p><p>As Ms. Minnella walked away from the house in New Hope, she was dispirited but resilient.</p><p>“You just have to take that you’ve planted a seed,” she said. “No one is ever going to say, ‘You changed my mind.’ But you never know if you’re the voice who echoes in their head.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-6e649b">‘We have an opportunity to vindicate ourselves’</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Attendees watching the 2016 presidential returns at Hillary Clinton’s election night event in Manhattan.

In <a href="https://x.com/tomselliott/status/1836406307097559347" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a September interview</a>, she discussed the “double standard” that Ms. Harris had been held to by people “grappling with the idea” of a female president.</p><p>“This is particularly true, let’s just say it and underline it,” Mrs. Clinton said, “about white women.”</p><p>White female support for Mr. Trump in previous elections broke down largely along educational lines, as he captured a majority of those without a college degree.</p><p>Pollsters and strategists say that is likely to bear out again this year — but that other factors could also be at play.</p><p>Ms. Harris has seen a groundswell of support from younger white women who are motivated to defend reproductive rights. Her campaign is also angling for white women without a college degree, who tend to lean Republican for economic reasons but are seen as more persuadable because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-care-economy.html" title="">Ms. Harris’s focus on the so-called care economy</a>, policies aimed at helping parents and other caregivers. And the number of unmarried women <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/10/05/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has continued to rise</a>, potentially diluting what some pollsters say is a significant influence — men — in how some women vote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Celinda Lake, a longtime pollster and Democratic strategist, said some of these women could be “silent” Harris supporters — those who may vote for her privately without telling their friends or husbands.</p><p>“One of the ways to empower them is to say, ‘You have your own way of doing things, you have a responsibility to vote for your daughters and granddaughters,’” she said.</p><p>She said Ms. Harris did not have to win over all of them, just enough to offset losses among white men.</p><p>“Win women more than you lose men,” she said. “That’s how Democrats win.”</p><h2 id="link-2aefd0e2">Doing something other than ‘doomscrolling’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Christina Romano, left, canvassing with Fiona Simpson this month in Media, Pa. “I want to tell my 4-year-old daughter one day that I did something other than doomscrolling,” Ms. Romano said as she prepared to knock on her first door.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Every week, the organizers of “White Women Answer the Call” have kept up the meetings, plotting how to have the “hard conversations” with the 53 percent who backed Mr. Trump in 2020.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Groups of women have hosted gatherings with neighbors in their cul-de-sacs, participated in postcard-writing campaigns, and papered public spaces with Post-it Notes urging other women to vote for Ms. Harris — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-sticky-notes-women-restrooms-gyms-tampon-boxes-rcna172570" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “whisper campaign”</a> to reach women who fear their votes will not be private.</p><p>During a sunny weekend this month, more than a dozen women joined Ms. Minnella in the Philadelphia suburbs to have some conversations face to face.</p><p>Several, like Christina Romano, 39, of Plymouth, Pa., were nervous first-time political activists. “I want to tell my 4-year-old daughter one day that I did something other than doomscrolling,” she said, her voice shaking, as she prepared to knock on her first door.</p><p>Many canvassers encountered women who had already voted early for Ms. Harris.</p><p>“Oh, Kamala, 100 percent,” Nico Morrison, 52, a small-business owner who is white, said within seconds of opening her door. She had already sent 1,200 postcards to Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, an outreach strategy by Democrats and liberal groups.</p><p>Ms. Morrison also revealed a more aggressive tactic that she had once avoided “to be polite” — confronting her Republican friends about the “chaos” that another Trump administration would bring. It has paid off, she said: Some of her female Republican friends have started accompanying her to Democratic rallies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I know die-hard Republicans who, at the end of the day, they know who they’re voting for — even if their husbands don’t,” she said. “It’s a thing. It’s remarkable in 2024, but honestly, they just don’t want the argument.”</p><p>Nicole Stone, 54, experienced this firsthand as she knocked on doors in Trouper, Pa. After leaving a townhouse where a man had declined to make his wife available, she heard him yell out the window: “My wife is going to vote for whoever her husband says she’s going to vote for.”</p><p>“I felt terrible,” she said. “It makes me wonder how many others are out there like that.”</p><p>Ms. Minnella and the other women concluded their canvassing over brunch at a restaurant, where they brought a Ziploc bag full of Post-it Notes to stick all over the bathroom. “Vote for all women,” said one.</p><p>But in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ms. Harris still faces an uphill battle.</p><p>Kelly Olson, 41, a registered independent in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., said that she did not believe either option was “horrible or the greatest candidate in the world” — her views aligned more with the former independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — but that she would vote for Mr. Trump. She described herself as “pro-choice,” but thought he would be stronger on the economy.</p><p>“A lot of people think he’s a misogynist or doesn’t have respect for women,” she said. “I think that might be a little bit true, but I just know that unfortunately, people that are in power are usually not the people you’d like to marry your mother or the people you’d invite to Thanksgiving dinner, but they know how to get things done.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“I’m sure Harris has an aggressive streak as well,” she added. “That’s politics.”</p><h2 id="link-26f8680">A fierce fight for white women</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Minnella placing a Post-it Note with a pro-Harris message on the mirror of a women’s bathroom at Villanova University. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ruth Fremson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s campaign has made an aggressive push for suburban, predominantly white women, especially moderate and conservative ones who have grown weary of Mr. Trump.</p><p>Jackie Payne, the executive director of Galvanize Action, a group focused on moderate female voters that formed after the 2016 election, said her organization had been surveying 6,000 moderate, white women in 10 politically competitive states since June. Its most recent findings, from September, showed more moving toward Ms. Harris. The economy was the top issue, followed by preserving democracy, immigration and reproductive freedom.</p><p>Ms. Payne suggested that many white women were leaning toward the candidate who aligned with their broad values — such as protection and patriotism — rather than their specific policy positions.</p><p>“Trust is really important to moderate white women,” she said.</p><p>Both campaigns have taken notice.</p><p>At a dinner this month, Mr. Trump taunted one of the pro-Harris affinity groups. “There’s a group called ‘White Dudes for Harris,’” he said, “but I’m not worried about them at all, because their wives and their wives’ lovers are all voting for me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Still, Mr. Trump appears wary of losing support among white women.</p><p>Despite proclaiming early in the race that he was “proud” to have helped overturn Roe, he has tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/us/politics/trump-abortion-stance.html" title="">soften his opposition to abortion rights</a>, dodging questions and calling himself “the father of I.V.F.,” referring to in vitro fertilization.</p><p>He has also tried to appeal to women by playing to potential fears about safety.</p><p>“I want to protect the women of our country,” he said at a rally on Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., adding, “I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not.”</p><p>Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/politics/harris-trump-women-arizona-las-vegas-nevada.html" title="">seized on his comments</a>, saying on Thursday that they were “very offensive” to all Americans.</p><p>The vice president, who has made “trust women” a central theme of her campaign, has notably declined to focus on her gender. And speaking this month at a suburban Michigan theater, she sidestepped a question about how she would seek to sway white women specifically, saying her message was for “all Americans.”</p><p>But some of her supporters are doing it for her.</p><p>Posted in a bathroom stall at the same theater was a hot-pink Post-it that read: “Woman to woman — your vote is secret. Support reproductive rights this November! We’re not going back.”</p><p>Taylor Robinson<!-- --> contributed reporting from New York, and <!-- -->Ruth Igielnik<!-- --> from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erica L.
