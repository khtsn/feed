It was a case that, for more than a year, had kept him shuffling around a townhouse wearing an ankle bracelet in a city 5,300 miles from home.</p><p>Nearby, Christopher J. Morvillo, the veteran corporate lawyer who helped lead Mr. Lynchâs legal team, also felt a huge wave of relief.</p><p>The two men had been joined at the hip for years to rebut HPâs accusations in the United States and Britain. One legal expert compared the proceedings in San Francisco to Enronâs in complexity, given the thousands of documents and accounting maneuvers at issue. An acquittal had seemed unlikely a year ago.</p><p>After leaving the courtroom, Mr. Lynch cut off his ankle bracelet. Mr. Morvillo turned to LinkedIn, writing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208202385188368384/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his first-ever post</a> to thank his colleagues and express his relief.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>âAnd they all lived happily ever after â¦.â he wrote.</p><p>That happy ending didnât last long.</p><p>Less than three months later, Mr. Lynch and Mr. Morvillo, both 59, died aboard the tech magnateâs family yacht, the Bayesian, when it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/europe/sicily-yacht-mike-lynch.html" title="">foundered off the coast of Sicily</a>. Five others died as well: Mr. Lynchâs 18-year-old daughter, Hannah; Mr. Morvilloâs wife, Neda; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/business/dealbook/morvillo-bloomer-mike-lynch-yacht.html" title="">Jonathan Bloomer</a>, a prominent British insurance executive; Mr. Bloomerâs wife, Judy; and Recaldo Thomas, the shipâs cook.</p><p>And in a bizarre coincidence, Stephen Chamberlain, a financial executive at Autonomy who was Mr. Lynchâs co-defendant in San Francisco, was fatally struck in a hit-and-run in England days before.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/world/europe/bayesian-yacht-sinking-italy.html" title="">Why the ship sank</a> remains under investigation by Italian and British authorities.

The presiding judge ordered that he be placed under house arrest given his potential flight risk, as well as round-the-clock security on his dime. (The British entrepreneur later jokingly referred to the guards as his roommates.)</p><p>But Mr. Lynch stayed busy. His mornings were spent checking on his venture capital firm and on researchers in Cambridge, whose work on artificial intelligence and hearing loss he was funding. Then he turned to his legal defense, peppering Mr. Morvillo with questions.</p><p>For Mr. Morvillo, that meant a move to San Francisco, where he called a downtown hotel home for four months, away from his wife, Neda; his dog; and two grown children.</p><p>âNeda and Chris lived their lives as devoted, loving parents who always put their daughters and families first,â the Morvillo family said in a statement. âTheir passing is a tremendous loss for our family and for the countless people who knew and loved them both.â</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Neda and Chris Morvillo in New York in 2018.

Jurors fell asleep. Every Thursday night, the Lynch legal team regrouped at dinner, over bottles of Sea Smoke Cellars pinot wine, Mr. Morvilloâs preference.</p><p>Mr. Lynch and his lawyers increasingly believed that jurors might find the Autonomy chief hard-driving â but in a way similar to other visionary tech giants like Elon Musk or Bill Gates.</p><p>The team decided to take a risk: Mr. Lynch would take the stand as the last witness. Questioning him for the defense was Mr. Morvillo, who by now had a feel for how to direct his client in testimony. They spoke affably in front of the jury, including by comparing the discovery of Autonomyâs troubles to taking a microscope to a spotless kitchen.</p><p>âI think his testimony was pivotal at the end of the day and probably is what won the day for us,â Mr. Morvillo told the âFor the Recordâ podcast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Waiting for the verdict was excruciating. In the courtroom on June 6, Mr. Lynch kissed his wife, Angela Bacares, on the forehead before sitting down next to his lawyers. Mr. Morvillo told him to take things one day at a time.</p><p>Minutes later, the jury began to deliver the first of 15 ânot guiltyâ verdicts.</p><p>That night, Mr. Lynch hosted a party for his legal team and his co-defendant, Mr. Chamberlain, at The Third Floor restaurant at the Jay Hotel in downtown San Francisco. In an emotional toast, Mr. Morvillo said that working the trial had been one of the legal teamâs life missions.</p><p>In his LinkedIn post, Mr. Morvillo thanked his wife and daughters for their support, adding, âI am so glad to be home.â</p><p>Mr. Lynch flew back to Britain with big dreams. He wanted to refocus on investing and advocating Britainâs technology industry.</p><p>Another priority was figuring out how to revamp an extradition treaty that he believed had unfairly sent him to the United States in chains.

He was waiting to hear how much he had to pay in damages in the British civil fraud case brought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a successor to HP, which said he owed up to $4 billion. (Hewlett Packard Enterprise said last month that it was still pursuing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/business/dealbook/mike-lynch-hp-lawsuit.html" title="">damages against Mr. Lynchâs estate</a>.)</p><p>But first and foremost, Mr. Lynch wanted to do â¦ nothing.</p><p>He returned to <a href="https://www.martin-salter.com/country-house/loudham-hall" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loudham Hall</a>, his sprawling 16th-century estate in Suffolk, England, where he raised Red Poll cattle and other livestock, and <a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/24535844.mike-lynchs-loyal-friends-suffolk-pay-tribute/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">held a garden party</a> for friends to celebrate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Bayesian was a $40 million superyacht owned by the family of Mr. Lynch.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-48362aeb">A Final Voyage</h2><p>And then there was the Bayesian, the 184-foot superyacht that his family owned.
