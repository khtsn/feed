They say their generous provisions for voters give the public greater confidence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The delay in full results has left Americans wondering why the balance of power in the House is yet to be known. It has also opened avenues for disinformation, with Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/technology/democrat-voter-turnout-election-conspiracy.html" title="">seizing upon the incomplete results</a> as evidence of voter fraud or manipulation.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election workers transported ballots at the City of Industry site on Saturday.

Mail-in ballots take longer to process than those cast in person.</p><p>Election offices must verify that the signature on each envelope matches the voter’s signature on file. Instead of throwing out ballots that were filled out improperly, election workers in California spend days calling voters and giving them another chance to verify their signatures so that their votes can be counted.</p><p>This process, known as ballot curing, occurs in half of U.S. states. But because nearly all of California’s ballots are mailed or hand-delivered in envelopes, the verification process is more tedious than elsewhere.<span>   </span></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And unlike most other states, California counts ballots that arrive up to a week late, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.</p><p>Twenty years ago, only a third of California voters cast ballots by mail, and 81 percent of votes were counted within two days of Election Day. In the primary election in March this year, when nearly 90 percent were cast by mail, only 59 percent had been counted within two days, according to an analysis by the nonprofit California Voter Foundation.</p><p>California gives counties 30 days to finalize their tallies, far longer than most states do. That means that counties can count at whatever speed suits them, hiring varying levels of reinforcements and drawing up different work schedules, as long as they finish by the deadline, said Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber, the top election official in California.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>California still had nearly five million votes to count going into the holiday weekend.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Ms. Weber said in an interview that she thought Californians were accustomed to a slower vote count and that other Americans became impatient only when there were national stakes, as is the case now with the House.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“That’s not our problem,” she said. “We go as fast as we can.”</p><p>California is responsible for the largest share of the outstanding ballots left.</p><p>Because Vice President Kamala Harris currently has 10 million fewer votes nationwide than President Biden did in 2020, a handful of Democrats have made unfounded claims that Republicans must have caused millions of ballots for Ms. Harris to disappear. Some Republicans in turn have incorrectly asserted that the current count for Ms. Harris is a more accurate reflection of national support for Democrats and shows that President Biden received fraudulent votes four years ago.</p><p>“Even actions that are actually just good-faith efforts to have a reliable election” can become fodder for conspiracy theories, said Eric Schickler<strong>,</strong> a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “There’s a lot of suspicion and distrust of governmental institutions — this ends up playing into that.”</p><p>Ms. Weber said that she was aware that an information vacuum could lead to false narratives, but she did not think that providing results faster in California would do much to stop election conspiracists.</p><p>“They’re going to do that anyway,” she said. “The reality is that even things that have been resolved, they create stories about them. We want to count every vote.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2022, it took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/us/politics/kevin-kiley-california-house.html" title="">two weeks</a> to determine the winner of a tight U.S. House race in a Northern California district. In 2018, a long delay led then-Speaker Paul Ryan to <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/29/california-2018-midterm-elections-results-voting-republicans-1031072" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">question the integrity</a> of the state’s voting system after Republicans lost several House contests in which it initially appeared that they would sail to victory.</p><p>As of Monday, 10 of the 17 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html" title="">uncalled House races</a> that will determine control of the chamber are in California, including in Orange County and the Central Valley. Five are among the most hotly contested in the nation.</p><p>Alameda County in Northern California, which includes Oakland, has counted more slowly than any other large county in California and had tallied only about one-third of its ballots two days after the election. The county does not have any battleground House races, but The Associated Press determined on Monday that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/elections/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao-recall.html" title="">Oakland mayor</a> and Alameda County district attorney had both been recalled by voters.</p><p>Any changes to speed up the process in Alameda would have to be approved by its board of supervisors, Tim Dupuis, the Alameda County registrar of voters, said.</p><p>“Right now, our staffing levels and the way that we work our hours allow us to get through all of the votes within the time period we’re allotted,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Election offices do not process ballots 24 hours a day. Many count during normal business hours and give workers days off before the counts are complete. In Orange and Marin Counties, employees were working on Saturday and Monday but not on Sunday. In Contra Costa County, counters stopped working on Friday and will start again Tuesday morning.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An outside observer at the vote-counting site.

Connelly, the Costa Contra County clerk-recorder and registrar of voters, said that her staff of nearly 120 employees was limited.</p><p>“We’re using all of our equipment and all of our people to go as fast as we can and maintain the quality,” Ms. Connelly said. “There’s constraints about space, there’s constraints about equipment, and so if you want to go faster, you need more of all of those things.”</p><p>Except for the whirring of two hulking sorting machines and scattered chitchat, there was quiet and concentration inside Los Angeles County’s 144,000-square-foot building in the City of Industry on Saturday afternoon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At one station, workers manually verified signatures that scanners were unable to read. At another, rows of workers carefully removed ballots from envelopes and checked for imperfections, churning through a handful of ballots every minute.</p><p>Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, said that election responsibilities had ballooned with the surge of mail-in ballots and threats of violence against workers in recent years. As the count continued in recent days, several election offices in California received bomb threats that led to evacuations before law enforcement officials determined there were no explosives.</p><p>“They do the best they can with what they have,” Ms. Alexander said.</p><p>A rush of last-minute ballots compounded the state’s counting burdens. Many local election officials said far more ballots arrived on Election Day this time than did four years ago. That meant that workers had less of a head start on counting, officials said.</p><p>In Los Angeles, the most populous county in the United States, roughly four million voters cast ballots, with one million mail-in ballots dropped off on Election Day, said Mike Sanchez, a spokesman with the registrar’s office. Election workers had to finish staffing polling places and counting in-person votes on Tuesday before they pivoted to processing those mail-in ballots.</p><p>In Marin County, north of San Francisco, more than a third of ballots arrived by mail on Monday and Tuesday, said Lynda Roberts, the Marin County registrar of voters. Also, 2,000 voters registered on Election Day. Same-day registration enables more Californians to participate but creates additional work.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“To get slammed at the end like that was a surprise,” Ms. Roberts said in an interview.</p><p>The delays in California’s tally have most likely distorted the popular-vote tally in the race between Ms. Harris and President-elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Schickler said. The current figures show Mr. Trump leading nationwide by about 3.6 million votes, but millions of Democratic votes have yet to be counted in California and other West Coast states.</p><p>Mr. Schickler said that Mr. Trump’s victory could ultimately look similar to Mr. Biden’s in 2020, with a smaller popular-vote win than there seemed to be on election night. Regardless, it will be difficult for Democrats to reframe the results for the public two weeks later.</p><p>“The narrative sets in and can be misleading, and California coming in so late contributes to that,” he said.</p><p>Shawn Hubler<!-- --> contributed reporting from Sacramento.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><svg id="election2020brand" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 25" width="80" height="20" aria-label="Election 2024"><rect width="25" height="25" fill="#f4564a"></rect><path d="m17.5,19.4H7.4v-2c.8-.8,1.7-1.5,2.6-2.2.7-.6,1.3-1.1,1.9-1.7,1.3-1.2,1.7-2.1,1.7-3.1,0-.8-.4-1.5-1.3-1.5-.8,0-1.6.6-2,2l-3-.9c.9-2.8,2.9-3.8,5.2-3.8,2.6,0,4.8,1.2,4.8,4.1,0,2.7-2.5,4.6-4.6,6.1h4.7v3h.1Z" fill="#fff"></path><rect x="25" width="25" height="25" fill="#2b8ad8"></rect><path d="m37.5,19.6c-3,0-5.3-2.4-5.3-6.7,0-3.9,1.9-6.7,5.3-6.7s5.3,2.9,5.3,6.7c0,4.1-2.1,6.7-5.3,6.7Zm0-10.9c-1.5,0-1.7,1.5-1.7,4.2,0,3,.3,4.1,1.7,4.1s1.7-1.1,1.7-4.1c0-2.7-.2-4.2-1.7-4.2Z" fill="#fff"></path><rect x="50" width="25" height="25" fill="#f4564a"></rect><rect x="75" width="25" height="25" fill="#2b8ad8"></rect><path d="m17.5,19.4H7.4v-2c.8-.8,1.7-1.5,2.6-2.2.7-.6,1.3-1.1,1.9-1.7,1.3-1.2,1.7-2.1,1.7-3.1,0-.8-.4-1.5-1.3-1.5-.8,0-1.6.6-2,2l-3-.9c.9-2.8,2.9-3.8,5.2-3.8,2.6,0,4.8,1.2,4.8,4.1,0,2.7-2.5,4.6-4.6,6.1h4.7v3h.1Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="m67.5,19.4h-10.1v-2c.8-.8,1.7-1.5,2.6-2.2.7-.6,1.3-1.1,1.9-1.7,1.3-1.2,1.7-2.1,1.7-3.1,0-.8-.4-1.5-1.3-1.5-.8,0-1.6.6-2,2l-3-.9c.9-2.8,2.9-3.8,5.2-3.8,2.6,0,4.8,1.2,4.8,4.1,0,2.7-2.5,4.6-4.6,6.1h4.7v3h.1Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="m92.68344,16.625h-1.94824v2.79688h-3.50977v-2.79688h-5.3623v-2.5459l5.6709-7.65723h3.20117v7.6377h1.94824v2.56543Zm-5.34277-2.56543v-3.87646l-2.87402,3.87646h2.87402Z" fill="#fff"></path></svg><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the 2024 Election</h2><hr/><p><strong>Aftermath of the Election</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Drop-Off in Democratic Turnout: </strong>Voters in liberal strongholds across the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/democrats-trump-harris-turnout.html">failed to show up to vote for Kamala Harris</a> at the levels they had for Joe Biden four years earlier, contributing significantly to her defeat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeking Revenge: </strong>Donald<strong> </strong>Trump spent much of the campaign focused on exacting “retribution,” leaving allies and adversaries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/politics/trump-enemies-prosecution.html">anticipating a wave of payback</a> after he returns to power.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Trump Insiders: </strong>As Trump’s team ramps up the transition process, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-administration-insiders.html">here are some of the key people</a> who will have an outsized influence on his cabinet.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Presidential Transition</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Lee Zeldin: </strong>Trump will nominate the former New York congressman to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/climate/trump-chooses-lee-zeldin-to-run-epa.html">lead the E.P.A.</a>, a position that is expected to be central to Trump’s plans to dismantle landmark climate regulations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stephen Miller: </strong>The immigration hard-liner and adviser to Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html">expected to be named deputy chief of staff</a>, according to people briefed on the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elise Stefanik: </strong>In one of his first cabinet-level personnel decisions, Trump offered the Republican member of Congress from New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador.html">the role of U.N. ambassador</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>More News and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Nancy Pelosi: </strong>In her first extended interview after the Democrats’ defeat, the former House speaker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/magazine/nancy-pelosi-election-interview.html">insisted the election was not a rebuke of her party</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>California’s Methodical Count: </strong>Ten of the 18 races that will determine which party controls the House are in California. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/california-ballot-count-house-election.html">No state takes longer to tally votes</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unions Brace for Blowback: </strong>Government unions, service worker unions and industrial unions bet big on Harris.
