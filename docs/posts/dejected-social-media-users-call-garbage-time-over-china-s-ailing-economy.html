Teams sub out their best players, and the contest limps toward its inevitable conclusion.</p><p>In China, where the internet is heavily censored, a handful of writers have repurposed “garbage time” to indirectly describe the country’s perceived decline. This summer, as the youth unemployment rate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/business/china-economy-consumption.html" title="">soared above 17 percent</a>, the term became a popular shorthand on Chinese social media for describing a sense of hopelessness around the ailing economy.</p><p>Commentaries about garbage times of history, some written under pseudonyms, began appearing last year in blog posts and as opinion essays on respected Chinese news sites. They examined past regimes and dynasties and were broadly understood to be thinly veiled critiques of China’s political and economic system. They landed as discussion of the economy — even misplaced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/world/asia/china-nationalist-hu-xijin-silent.html" title="">praise for the ruling Communist Party’s economic policies</a> — was getting more sensitive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A job fair in Huai’an in Jiangsu province in June.

Beijing Daily, the city’s main official Communist Party newspaper, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cXD-tHTcK4sbjAhHldR-EQ?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in an editorial</a> that readers should not “spiral into self-pity just because of a few words of incitement with ulterior motives.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Here’s what the fuss was about.</p><h2 id="link-1cc31386">The writers see earlier garbage time in China and beyond.</h2><p>The commentaries argued that rulers throughout history have fallen into garbage time by centralizing power, rejecting free trade or losing public trust. Some even suggested that any societies that were not capitalist democracies were doomed to fail.</p><p>Some examined other state-controlled economies. One from November <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/703427.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the Soviet Union had been in garbage time for its entire existence. The article, which cited the writings of <a href="https://mises.org/library/book/socialism-economic-and-sociological-analysis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an Austrian philosopher</a> who championed free markets and argued against socialism, argued that the U.S.S.R.’s planned economy and undemocratic government made its collapse inevitable.</p><p>Others looked at Chinese history. One opinion essay from February <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240718003632/https://www.sohu.com/a/757328796_118622" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> that Zhu Yuanzhang, who served as the Ming dynasty’s first emperor in the 14th century, plunged the entire 276-year regime into garbage time by monopolizing power, introducing isolationist trade policies and imposing harsh laws. The piece contrasted that failure with the flourishing of Britain’s economy during the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, attributing the success to colonialism and free-trade policies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Zhu Yuanzhang, first ruler of the Ming Dynasty.

The trouble started when the public lost faith in its leaders once the reigning empress, Cixi, fled after foreign troops suppressed a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Boxer-Rebellion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peasant uprising</a> she had backed, the author wrote.</p><p>Although the Qing had previously suffered defeats, this was the first to be felt widely by the public, the blog post said. As a result, it shattered the widespread perception that the dynasty was still on the rise.</p><h2 id="link-2bf0a1bb">The garbage time pieces implicitly challenged the government.</h2><p>Even though the commentaries didn’t mention modern China or the Communist Party, experts say they implicitly challenged the country’s authoritarian governance and state-controlled economy. In that sense, they were part of a Chinese literary tradition of intellectuals avoiding censorship by criticizing rulers through historical allegories.</p><p>“The real argument, the key, is actually about the legitimacy of the party,” said Xiao Qiang, a researcher on internet freedom at the University of California, Berkeley, who <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/710773.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracked</a> some of the discussion around and censorship of garbage time commentaries.</p><p>The concept of garbage time, and the idea that societies will inevitably collapse without economic concepts like free trade, contradicts the Marxist idea of historical inevitability that the Chinese government promotes, said Isabella Jackson, an assistant professor of Chinese history at Trinity College Dublin. That narrative argues that through class struggle all societies will eventually transition from capitalism to socialism to communism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Footage of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, at a Communist Party policy meeting in Beijing in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tingshu Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The commentaries seem to be aimed more at making a particular argument than accurately portraying history, Professor Jackson added. Dismissing the whole Ming dynasty as garbage time is an oversimplification of a court that flourished during its peak, she said. Among other things, literature thrived, and Ming mariners undertook seven massive trade and diplomatic expeditions to regions like East Africa and the Persian Gulf.</p><p>Still, she said, “You can see the point that a lot of things that were celebrated didn’t really benefit ordinary people.”</p><h2 id="link-7f4ad2dd">Chinese officialdom called the term malicious.</h2><p>The phrase’s online popularity appears to have peaked in July, shortly before top officials gathered for a meeting to set the direction of China’s economy. Many economists had called for a shift from investment-led growth toward consumer spending, but the meeting ended with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/business/china-economy-third-plenum-decision.html" title="">few signs of a fundamental policy rethink</a>.</p><p>As the state media tried to get the Chinese public excited about the meeting, some outlets and commentators accused those who used “garbage time” of sowing pessimism and idealizing Western values. Ming Jinwei, a former journalist at the state news agency Xinhua, <a href="https://user.guancha.cn/wap/content?id=1263057" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the concept had been coined by a small group of “petty bourgeois intellectuals.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Academics chimed in. In a commencement speech, Qiao Liu, a dean at Peking University, <a href="https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/info/1022/29568.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned students</a> not to fall into “narrative traps” like garbage time that can be used to distort facts, influence people’s behavior and have negative consequences for the economy.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dining out in Beijing in July.

He said that garbage time arguments encouraged inaction and “completely denied China’s growth.”</p><p>Mr. Wang acknowledged that the phrase’s popularity reflected broader anxieties and showed the need for urgent changes that would bolster the economy and ease people’s concerns.</p><p>If they could feel their lives improving, he wrote, “The harmful effects of these counterfeit, false concepts will be neutralized.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
