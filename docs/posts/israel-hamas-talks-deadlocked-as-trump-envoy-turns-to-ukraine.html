the Trump administration turned its attention to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/13/world/russia-ukraine-moscow-war-kursk" title="">talks with Russian officials in Moscow</a> over the Ukraine war.</p><p>Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, was expected to leave the latest round of Gaza talks in the Gulf emirate of Qatar for Russia on Thursday. Mr. Trump has effectively charged Mr. Witkoff with working to resolve two of the world’s most fraught conflicts — the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.</p><p>The latest round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas in the Qatari capital of Doha this week have borne little fruit amid entrenched disagreements over the deal’s next steps, according to an Israeli official familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In mid-January, the two sides agreed to a multiphase truce that would ultimately end Israel’s military campaign against Hamas in Gaza and free the Israeli and foreign hostages held by Palestinian militants there. The cease-fire began with a six-week pause in the fighting, during which Hamas released more than 30 hostages in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, was expected to leave the latest round of talks in Qatar for Russia on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ben Curtis/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During the initial phase of the truce, Israel and Hamas were meant to negotiate a second phase that envisioned an end to the war, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the release of all of the surviving hostages still held in the territory.</p><p>But the two sides remain far apart on how to move ahead. Israel is still vowing to destroy Hamas and is insisting on the demilitarization of Gaza. Hamas has largely refused to disband its armed battalions or send its Gaza leaders.</p><p>The 42-day first phase elapsed in early March without a deal on the second phase, although the fragile truce has held up so far without it, at least for now.</p><p>Critics in Israel have accused Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, of dragging his feet on an agreement for fear it would loosen his grip on power. His far-right allies in the governing coalition are pressing to go on with the war against Hamas despite concerns from the families of the remaining hostages that their loved ones may not survive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Up to 24 living hostages are still being held in Gaza along with the remains of more than 30 others who were taken captive, according to the Israeli government. Hamas seized about 250 people in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel and ignited the devastating 15-month-war in Gaza.</p><p>Earlier this month, Israel imposed harsh restrictions on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, barring the entry of food and other much-needed goods. The Israeli authorities later cut off electricity to a wastewater treatment center in Gaza.</p><p>That has prompted fears of a resurgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The widespread wartime deprivation had eased somewhat since the cease-fire and trucks of aid had begun to enter freely.</p><p>Qatar, which has been brokering the truce alongside Egypt and the United States, has <a href="https://x.com/MofaQatar_EN/status/1896298025213215014" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticized</a> the Israeli decision to close crossings to aid as a violation of the cease-fire agreement.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Trump’s pick for special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, met with senior Hamas leaders in Qatar, sidestepping the moribund cease-fire talks. The talks broke with the United States’ yearslong precedent of generally refusing to negotiate directly with Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. </p><p>But even those efforts — which focused on freeing Edan Alexander, the last remaining Israeli American captive believed to be alive, and securing the release of the bodies of four others — did not produce an agreement. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, later called the attempt a “one-off” that “hasn’t borne fruit.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
