That accord limited the amount of nuclear material Iran could possess, and restricted enrichment to 3.67 percent, the level needed to produce fuel for nuclear power plants.</p><p>But Mr. Trump pulled out of that accord. And for the past three years, Iran has been enriching at far higher levels: around 60 percent purity, just shy of what is needed to produce a nuclear weapon. That gives Tehran two options: race to produce weapons-grade fuel, or negotiate with the United States to return to the original levels in the accord with the Obama administration.</p><p>Steve Witkoff, the chief American negotiator, expressed a willingness earlier this week to follow that path. But that exposed Mr. Trump to the critique that after declaring the decade-old agreement a “disaster” and scrapping it, he is getting nothing better.</p><p>So Mr. Witkoff was forced on Wednesday to backtrack. He posted on social media that the U.S. position is now that “Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.” The key word was “eliminate.”</p><p>Mr. Witkoff did not speak immediately after the negotiations — the second round in two weeks — ended on Saturday afternoon in Rome. Oman, which is acting as mediator in the talks, said those technical negotiations would take place in Muscat, its capital, in the coming days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When pressed this week on whether the United States could live with Iran having a limited nuclear-enrichment capability, American officials dodged the question, saying only that Mr. Trump had vowed that Iran would not be permitted to have a nuclear weapon.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff will now have to brief Mr. Trump and his administration colleagues about the latest round of talks. Officials familiar with the internal debate say that Mr. Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, both of whom were harsh critics of the Obama-era deal when they served in Congress, remain opposed to leaving Iran with any nuclear production capability.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Rubio said that any deal must keep Iran from ever possessing a nuclear weapon. “It has to be something that not just prevents Iran from having a nuclear weapon now, but in the future as well,” he told reporters on a trip to Paris.</p><p>But Mr. Witkoff, like the negotiators for Mr. Obama a decade ago, has apparently concluded that the only way to achieve a deal is to allow some enrichment capability monitored and verified by American or international inspectors.</p><p>Israel has long relied on President Trump to take a hard line against Iran, which has called for the destruction of the Jewish state. And during his first term in office, he did, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/world/middleeast/suleimani-iran-iraq-strike.html" title="">ordering the killing</a> of a top Iranian security official, devastating Tehran’s economy with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/us/politics/iran-sanctions-trump.html" title="">American sanctions</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">abandoning an international accord</a> limiting Iran’s nuclear program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But now, as Mr. Trump resists being pulled into a new war in the Middle East, he is trying a more measured approach.</p><p>While the specter of military action remains — “If we have to do something very harsh, we’ll do it,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdNO3F4xi9Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump said</a> this past week — he has pushed ahead with negotiations and is said to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-israel-iran-nuclear.html" title="">asked Israel to hold off</a> from attacking Iran’s nuclear sites.</p><p>All of that has put Israel on edge over where the talks are headed.</p><p>“The question is, what exactly is the U.S. going to insist?” the Israeli diplomat Michael Herzog, who stepped down in January as Israel’s ambassador to Washington, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc9Xd900b5M" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said this past week</a>. “What model is it going for as a diplomatic outcome?”</p><p>Mr. Araghchi told Italian officials before the start of Saturday’s negotiations that it was necessary “for all parties to take advantage of the opportunity presented,” according to Tasnim, a semiofficial news agency affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.</p><p>The objective, Mr. Araghchi said, was to reach “a logical and rational understanding that, while respecting the legitimate rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran and lifting the cruel and illegal sanctions, would remove any doubts about Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Esmaeil Baqaei, the spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, told Iranian state TV that the negations on Saturday would take place in two different rooms, similar to the first round.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump has, for now, chosen diplomacy over military action.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-4baca44b">A Question of Red Lines</h2><p>Iran, too, has tempered its expectations for the renewed diplomatic efforts over the next two months, under a deadline set by Mr. Trump.</p><p>“This must be pursued carefully,” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, <a href="https://x.com/khamenei_ir/status/1912109644014629321" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> posted Tuesday on social media. “The red lines are clear.

It refuses to stop enriching uranium, the material needed to make a nuclear bomb.</p><p>For more than a decade, world leaders have sought to limit Iran’s uranium enrichment to levels far below what is necessary to be weaponized. That requires independent verification from outside inspectors. On Wednesday, the head of the United Nations atomic agency, Rafael Grossi, <a href="https://x.com/rafaelmgrossi/status/1912561825394082119" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was in Tehran</a> to urge its leaders to cooperate.</p><p><a href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/the-iran-threat-geiger-counter-extreme-danger-grows/8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scientists believe</a> Iran is closer than ever to being able to produce six or more nuclear weapons in months, or perhaps a year.</p><p>After meeting last week with Iran’s foreign minister, Mr. Araghchi, Mr. Witkoff <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371553683112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested Iran</a> might be able to produce low levels of uranium under a verification system that would also extend to Tehran’s missile program. But within a day, Mr. Witkoff <a href="https://x.com/SE_MiddleEast/status/1912141949932298432" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pivoted to insist</a> that “Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program” for any deal to be struck.</p><p>Experts said Mr. Witkoff’s shift reflects the uncertainty in the Trump administration — and most likely of the president himself — over whether it thinks it can strike a reasonable deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Trump administration might be open to allowing low enrichment as long as Iran offers an unprecedented concession of its own, like opening its nuclear sites to U.S. inspectors or welcoming American investors, said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior Middle East policy expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>“My sense is that the Iranians and the Americans are still at a stage where they are defining one another’s red lines,” said Ms. Geranmayeh, who has been analyzing Iran’s nuclear diplomacy for more than a decade. “And it would be really critical, soon, for the Americans to come out with a final position.”</p><p>She also said that Iran had never accepted full nuclear dismantlement or zero enrichment, and “if this is where the Americans go, we are heading toward a military confrontation.”</p><p>That may be what Israel and its allies in Congress want. “It is in their interest to push the conversation between the Iranians and the U.S. toward a dead end,” Ms. Geranmayeh said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran and commanders of the country’s military watching as military equipment passed during the parade on Friday in Tehran.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-aff4609">A Ticking Clock</h2><p>Israel believes it has a narrow window of opportunity to strike Iran’s nuclear sites at a time when Tehran is weakened militarily and economically.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Almost all of the attack plans that Mr. Trump has asked Israel to shelve would have required the United States to take a central role to ensure its success and defend Israel from retaliation.

Bush administration.</p><p>With Iran’s nuclear program advancing, and the memory of hesitating when Hamas militants attacked on Oct. 7, 2023, in the deadliest single day in Israeli history, “they’ve learned they just can’t wait any more,” he said.</p><p>Leily Nikounazar<!-- --> and <!-- -->Emma Bubola<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
