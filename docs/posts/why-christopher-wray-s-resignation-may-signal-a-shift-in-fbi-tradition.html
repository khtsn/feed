Wray had considered resigning as F.B.I. director before. More than once, confronted with angry demands from President Donald J. Trump and his allies, he contemplated calling it quits.</p><p>When Mr. Wray on Wednesday announced his intent to do so, it was because he believed staying on the job into a second Trump term risked significant disruptions to the work force and its mission.</p><p>Mr. Trump had already declared his plan to replace him with Kash Patel, a tough-talking loyalist who has vowed to force out bureau leaders and empty its Washington headquarters.</p><p>In conceding to the reality of raw power, Mr. Wray’s voluntary departure could usher in a new era at the nation’s premier law enforcement agency, one in which the job of director is more of a political post that changes with the administration. For decades, F.B.I. directors have been appointed to 10-year terms to insulate them from the shifting winds of politics. Few F.B.I. directors stay a full decade, and the circumstances of Mr. Wray’s departure after seven years suggest that insulation has worn thin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We are now in a position in which no F.B.I. director may be expected to serve for 10 years, and every time a new president comes in, that new president is likely to signal that the director will be replaced,” said John C. Richter, a Republican and a former U.S. attorney who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Wray.</p><p>By several measures — agent recruitment and retention, arrests, and disrupted plots — the F.B.I. has been successful during Mr. Wray’s tenure, even as its politically charged cases consumed most of the public attention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Since its creation more than 100 years ago, the F.B.I. has operated in the mold designed by J. Edgar Hoover.

That way, they reasoned, the F.B.I. would have committed publicly to the principle that the leadership of the agency should not change just because the occupant of the White House does.</p><p>Mr. Wray’s cited reason for stepping down was to protect the bureau, according to one frustrated law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity to publicly discuss the issue, but it would likely have the opposite effect.</p><p>Some Republican lawmakers have already indicated a willingness to go along with replacing Mr. Wray with Mr. Patel, highlighting the extent to which Mr. Trump’s deep antagonism toward the F.B.I. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/kash-patel-republicans-fbi.html" title="">has become the party line</a>.</p><p>Days earlier, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican of Iowa who is in line to chair the Judiciary Committee in the next Congress, publicly urged Mr. Wray to step down.</p><p>“For the good of the country, it’s time for you and your deputy to move on to the next chapter in your lives,” Mr. Grassley wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Addressing employees on Wednesday, Mr. Wray said he did not want his job status to become a distraction or encumbrance to the F.B.I. Many veterans of the agency recall the moment in May 2017 when Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as the director.</p><p>“For those of us who saw it firsthand, the last firing was an intentional indignity to the director, who was barred from the building, his personal effects and his employees. His office was cordoned off like a crime scene,” said Michael Kortan, who served as the F.B.I.’s top spokesman at the time. The nature of that dismissal, Mr. Kortan said, “was a stunning and lasting blow to the morale of employees.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kash Patel has promised to force out bureau leaders and shut down its Washington headquarters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Brenner for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Wray decided around mid-November to resign before Mr. Trump was sworn into office, according to a person familiar with his thinking. He reached that conclusion even before Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/trump-replace-christopher-wray.html" title="">publicly announced his desire</a> to replace him with Mr. Patel.</p><p>Mr. Wray had been considering various options since the summer, according to people familiar with the discussions, though he remained tight-lipped about his thinking even among senior Justice Department and F.B.I. leaders. Even after Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Wray considered staying on to be fired, to make a point about the bureau’s independence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ultimately, though, he came to believe that there was too much risk to worker morale, and potential distraction from the mission, to put his fate in the hands of the next president. Like many national security officials, Mr. Wray also worried that any change in administration would lead to gaps in official attentiveness to threats, and he did not want his uncertain job status to add to that risk.</p><p>“I was very sorry to see his tenure play out this way. It’s an incredibly challenging job in the best of circumstances,” said Greg Brower, a former F.B.I. official who worked for both Mr. Comey and Mr. Wray.</p><p>Since its creation more than 100 years ago, the F.B.I. has operated in the mold designed by J. Edgar Hoover, the director who served for decades, amassing substantial power while standing beside presidents of both parties. When Mr. Hoover died, political leaders instituted the 10-year term limit for future directors as a way of keeping them from becoming so powerful.</p><p>Only one of Mr. Hoover’s successors completed the full 10 years: Robert S. Mueller III. He was so trusted by both political parties that he was asked to serve an additional two years.</p><p>The choreography of cooperation between the country’s elected leaders and the agency that polices them for corruption is not always smooth, and was most disjointed during the Watergate scandal that ultimately ousted President Nixon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In the decades since, there were generally understood lines that politicians were reluctant to cross for fear of being accused of abusing their power by directing or stalling criminal investigations and prosecutions.</p><p>Since 2016, however, F.B.I. investigations have played a central role in presidential politics, as agents scrutinized candidates of the major parties, and in Mr. Trump’s case, gathered the evidence for two criminal indictments brought by the Justice Department.</p><p>In that time, many elected officials, particularly Democrats, have argued that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. stand guard over the primacy of the rule of law that makes democracy itself function.</p><p>Two stillborn prosecutions of a former president, followed by the willing departure of the F.B.I. director who oversaw those cases, have made it increasingly clear that law enforcement, even an agency as powerful as the F.B.I., serves with the protection and blessing of the country’s political leaders.</p><p>Mr. Richter, the former U.S. attorney, said the true measure of Mr. Wray’s tenure may be acknowledged only after he has left Washington.</p><p>“I think he has served his country incredibly well, but only with the benefit of hindsight will some people recognize what we have lost when he’s gone,” Mr. Richter said. “At the end of the day, the Justice Department and by extension the F.B.I. are necessarily subordinate to the president of the United States, and they always have been and always will be.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-bureau-of-investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/j-edgar-hoover">J.
