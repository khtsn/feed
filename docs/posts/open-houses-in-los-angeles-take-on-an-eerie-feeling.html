Her nephew bought it last year as an investment, and she lent him money to renovate the kitchen and two-and-a-half bathrooms. </p><p>When they were making plans to flip the home, they could not predict the catastrophic fires that have engulfed Los Angeles, threatening their property and upending the real estate market. Pasadena neighbors Altadena, a community where at least 16 people were killed and more than 7,000 structures have been destroyed by the Eaton fire. But Pasadena, a picturesque city at the foot of the San Gabriel mountains, escaped the fires largely unscathed. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>So as Lisa Chen and her toddler walked around the home on Saturday, Ms. Garcia was sure to note that the white stucco house high up in the hills overlooking a steep canyon had a new, fireproof roof and had fared well in the fire. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ash from the Eaton fire covered the deck and driveway of the house on Woodcliffe Road.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Chen, 32, a stay-at-home parent, told a reporter that she has been house hunting for a year. Before the fires, she had prioritized living in a neighborhood with good schools. Safety is now also at the top of her list, she said, and living in the hills is dicey. “The flats are better,” she said as she left. </p><p>This weekend, the typically staid open house ritual took on an eerie quality, as smoke still lingered. Buyers opened cabinets, surveyed bedrooms and expressed concern about how much homeowners or fire insurance would cost, if they could even get it, given the scale of the disaster. They voiced trepidation about buying homes in the hills, and even in some parts of the flats, wondering if they needed to re-evaluate the risk. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Homes on S.

Orange Grove Blvd., along the Rose Bowl parade route, Dana Lance sat on a plush bench and considered the past two weeks. For four days, he and his wife, Judith Porter, kept their cars packed with all their valuables as fire raged about seven miles from their home on a winding, wooded street atop Mount Washington in Los Angeles. The risk of fire “had always been in the back of her mind,” Mr. Lance said of his wife. “But now she wants out.” </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Their long-term goal to move out of the hills and into the flats has taken on a new urgency.</p><p>“We think we can handle Mother Nature, but we can’t,” said Mr. Lance, 66, a contractor who, on Thursday, made an all cash bid on another Pasadena house, but lost out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Neha Mehta had been looking at homes in Altadena before the fires.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Before the fire, Neha Mehta, 36, who rents in Pasadena, had been looking at homes in Altadena. Many of them were likely destroyed in the fire, she said. Now, she was reconsidering where she’d look, focusing on neighborhoods south of I-210, the freeway that divides Pasadena and could provide another barrier to flames. “This feels very safe to me now,” she said of the immediate neighborhood. </p><p>Last weekend, half of the people who toured the townhouse were displaced from the fires, according to Laurie Turner, who, with her husband, David Turner, is the listing agent. “The clothes didn’t match, they had a pet with them, they were shellshocked,” she said. One couple asked if they could buy the house along with all the furniture used to stage it. Ms. Turner said yes. The couple made an offer. But this Saturday, no one impacted by the fires visited the townhouse. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Lance is eager to move to lower ground from his house atop Mount Washington. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Turner thinks buyers may re-evaluate their choices and priorities after the fire.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Miles away on Woodcliffe Road, Ms. Garcia swept the floors and wiped the counters before the open house began, reassuring her nephew, Shannon Horton, 32, that the house would sell. The house went on the market the day the Palisades fire started. That night, Mr. Horton watched on his phone as his security camera picked up ash falling like snow onto the property. “SimpliSafe was my television for a little bit,” Mr. Horton said. “Do I still have a house when I wake up?”</p><p>The house and the neighborhood made it through the fire unscathed, although an inch of ash that had to be power washed from the deck and driveway. Ms. Garcia said she was shocked the house hadn’t filled with smoke and ash, too. Relieved that his investment was intact, Mr. Horton wondered, “Is anyone going to want to live here?” </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Garcia is hopeful buyers will still be drawn to the house in the hills.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Ms. Garcia was more optimistic. “It’s going to sell,” she said, “I don’t see a world where it doesn’t.” </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Yet, in the first hour, only Ms. Chen and her toddler showed up.</p><p>Ms. Garcia’s enthusiasm started to wane. She had expected a line of cars parking along the narrow road, with visitors waiting for the doors to open. Maybe Sunday would be better, she thought. If no offers came in by the middle of the week, they could hold another open house, she said. “It’s no bueno,” she said, standing in the kitchen, leaning against the countertop. “But we’ll see how it plays out.”</p><p>Amancai Biraben<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ronda Kaysen, a real estate reporter for The Times, writes about the intersection of housing and society.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ronda-kaysen">More about Ronda Kaysen</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
