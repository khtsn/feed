A Nevada commissioner ruled against his attempt to modify the terms of a family trust that would have stripped three of his other children of their voting rights over his empire.</p><p>The media mogul, who plans to appeal the ruling, is used to getting his way, The Times’s Edmund Lee writes for DealBook. Now what?</p><p><strong>A recap: </strong>Under the current arrangement, when Murdoch dies, four of his children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence — will have an equal say in what happens next because they will inherit his voting shares.</p><p>But Elisabeth and James have different political leanings from Lachlan and their father, and James has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/business/media/rupert-murdoch-succession-fox.html" title="">indirectly criticized</a> how Fox News operates. The three siblings contested the attempts to change the trust.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>This was perhaps the last maneuver of Murdoch’s seven-decade career. </strong>The 93-year-old wanted to give Lachlan control over his news outlets — which include Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and major newspapers and television outlets in Australia and Britain — to maintain their right-leaning slant.</p><p>Fox News stars have been instrumental in helping President-elect Donald Trump through his three presidential campaigns.</p><p><strong>Murdoch may have feared a corporate coup after his death. </strong>But according to the ruling, the three had “disavowed any plan to oust their brother,” and did not have any aim to change the management of Fox News.</p><p><strong>The ruling included some notable details:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Edmund Gorman Jr., the Nevada commissioner, characterized the plan to change the trust as a “carefully crafted charade” to keep Lachlan in power.</p></li><li><p>An episode of HBO’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/business/media/hbo-succession-business.html" title="">Succession</a>” that dramatized the chaos after the death of a Murdoch-like patriarch spurred a discussion among the children about how to manage their affairs once their father dies. It even prompted Elisabeth’s representative to the trust to write a “‘Succession’ memo,” to avoid what happened on the show. (The show’s creator, incidentally, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/business/media/hbo-succession-business.html" title="">has said</a> he was directly inspired by Murdoch.)</p></li><li><p>Lachlan instigated the plan to change the trust — named “Project Family Harmony” — in mid-2023. It deemed James the “troublesome beneficiary.”</p></li><li><p>Lachlan, Murdoch and their advisers considered trying to cut out James by severing his “sub-trust” from the larger trust. But Lachlan and Murdoch decided they could maintain tighter control by keeping James’s shares in the family trust.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What could happen if Murdoch loses the appeal? </strong>He could sell the rest of his company before he dies. When Murdoch sold the bulk of his empire to Disney in 2019, it surprised many, but helped him largely dodge the expensive streaming wars.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It also underscored an often overlooked aspect of Murdoch: He’s practical and unsentimental, and willing to make big moves when others are skeptical.</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s C.E.O. is charged with murder.</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-ceo-suspect-arrest-altoona.html" title="">Luigi Mangione</a> was arrested on Monday in Altoona, Pa., and was found with a gun and a silencer similar to those believed to have been used in the shooting of Brian Thompson, as well as a manifesto condemning the health care industry, officials said. Social media posts by Mangione appeared to include a positive review of a book by Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.</p><p><strong>More than 75 Nobel laureates urge senators not to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong> The group cited Kennedy’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/health/kennedy-hhs-nobel-laureates.html" title="">political attacks on science</a>” and “lack of credentials” in science, medicine or administration as reasons to oppose his leading the Department of Health and Human Services. President-elect Donald Trump, who has suggested that he would let Kennedy explore a debunked link between vaccines and autism, defended his pick against “elites.”</p><p><strong>Cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas are said to be advancing.</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">Discussions are gaining momentum</a> after the Israel-Hezbollah truce in Lebanon and pressure from Trump, The Times reports. Proposals that have been floated include a 60-day cease-fire, the release of hostages in Gaza in exchange for jailed Palestinians and potentially allowing Israeli forces to stay in the territory a little longer.</p><p><strong>Google claims another breakthrough in quantum computing.</strong> The tech giant said it had created a computer that could perform a mathematical calculation in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/google-quantum-computing.html" title="">less than five minutes</a> that a traditional supercomputer can’t solve in 10 septillion years.

Lawmakers say that TikTok is a national security risk because it is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. TikTok argues that a sale is impossible and that a ban would violate the First Amendment rights of Americans.</p><p>Here’s what could happen next, The Times’s Sapna Maheshwari writes for DealBook.</p><p><strong>The Supreme Court could take up TikTok’s case.</strong></p><p>TikTok is hoping for a Hail Mary by way of the Supreme Court or the Trump administration. On Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/business/tiktok-temporary-pause-ban-supreme-court-trump.html" title="">the company asked a federal court</a> to temporarily freeze the law pending review of a planned appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>There’s no guarantee that the court will take up the case, but experts say it’s likely given the free speech concerns and the app’s 170 million U.S. users.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>ByteDance could sell TikTok.</strong></p><p>TikTok has named many reasons it can’t be sold, including that China could block a transaction. One of the judges in the ruling was skeptical of that, writing that Congress “need not legislate around another country’s preferences to exercise its own powers constitutionally — much less the preferences of a designated foreign adversary.”</p><p>Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, and the billionaire Frank McCourt have expressed interest in buying TikTok, though a price tag is expected to be upward of $200 billion.</p><p><strong>Trump could get involved.</strong></p><p>It’s hard to say how President-elect Donald Trump would fulfill his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/technology/trump-tiktok-ban.html" title="">campaign promise to “save” TikTok</a>. If there is no sale or reprieve, the law would goes into effect on Jan. 19 — the day before he is set to be inaugurated. It’s unlikely that Congress would repeal the law, and Trump is notably hawkish on China, anyway. (He had tried to block the app in the United States in 2020 and force its sale to an American company, though he has since dropped his opposition to the platform.)</p><p>Trump could try to help orchestrate a deal so that TikTok and ByteDance meet the letter of the law for a divestment.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The fate of Hershey, the chocolate producer, lies with a century-old charitable trust.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Blake/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-d767e75">A matter of trust for Hershey</h2><p>Mondelez is said to be trying again to buy Hershey, seeking to create an international giant in the business of snacking.
