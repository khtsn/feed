Sunday offered British troops to help guarantee Ukraine’s security as part of any peace deal, as he and other European leaders rushed to coordinate a response to President Trump’s opening of talks with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/02/16/sir-keir-starmer-british-troops-ukraine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article published in The Daily Telegraph</a> on Sunday, Mr. Starmer wrote that he was “ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by putting our own troops on the ground if necessary.”</p><p>It was the first time Mr. Starmer had explicitly said that he was considering sending British troops to Ukraine. It came on the eve of an emergency meeting of European leaders in Paris on Monday, to formulate a response to Mr. Trump’s push for a settlement — one that appeared to leave Europe and Ukraine with no clear role in the process.</p><p>In the article, Mr. Starmer wrote that he was not committing British troops lightly. But “securing a lasting peace in Ukraine that safeguards its sovereignty for the long term is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future,” he wrote, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” Mr. Starmer added.</p><p>American and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia this week for the start of talks aimed at ending the war. The discussions are said to be preliminary. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday that if an opportunity presented itself for a “broader conversation,” it would include Ukraine and Europe.</p><p>But the talks underscore that Mr. Trump has an accelerated timetable for reaching a deal to end the war and that he appears determined to conduct negotiations with Russia bilaterally, at least for now. Ukraine confirmed on Sunday that it would not take part in the discussions in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The meeting in Paris on Monday will include Mr. Starmer and the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as top officials of the European Union and NATO. The leaders say they will discuss the war and European security.</p><p>Mr. Starmer wrote in his article that he would urge the other leaders to increase military spending and take on a greater role in NATO. He added that Ukraine’s path to joining NATO was “irreversible.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Starmer, who is expected to meet with President Trump in the coming weeks, wrote that Europe and the United States must continue to work closely to secure a lasting peace deal. “A U.S. security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the U.S. can deter Putin from attacking again,” he wrote.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/yan-zhuang">More about Yan Zhuang</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/european-union">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/north-atlantic-treaty-organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>JD Vance:</strong> In Munich, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html">the vice president urged European leaders to end the isolation of far-right parties</a>, embracing a political movement with which the Trump administration shares a common approach on migration, identity and internet speech. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/vance-far-right-germany-munich-afd.html">It is a message he has long promoted</a> in the U.S.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obamacare:</strong> The administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/trump-obamacare-navigators.html">said it would drastically cut annual spending on so-called navigator groups</a> that help Americans enroll in health insurance plans, from around $100 million to just $10 million.</p></li><li><p><strong>Project 2025:</strong> The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/us/politics/project-2025-trump-actions.html">found more than 60 major moves made by the administration in its first 23 days</a> that align with proposals in the right-wing blueprint for overhauling the government.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘The Boss of Everyone and Everything’: </strong>President Trump is increasingly trying to enforce his will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/politics/trump-influence.html">on areas like the arts, sports, news, private companies and college campuses</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Justice Dept.
