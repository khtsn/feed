Ms. Beskhmelnytsina, a film producer and director, had come home from a movie premiere exhausted that evening and decided to answer him the next morning.</p><p>The next day, she woke to the sound of bombs; Russia had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>“I receive this message as my world is turning upside down,” Ms. Beskhmelnytsina said. Still, with all the chaos around her, one thing was clear. “I really want to date him,” she said.</p><p>After weighing her options, Ms. Beskhmelnytsina decided to remain in Kyiv to work as a fixer for two photographers, Ron Haviv of The Economist, and Heidi Levine of The Washington Post. (A fixer, or field producer, translates and explains local customs or policies, communicates with local authorities and arranges interviews and logistics for journalists.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In tandem with that role, she began documenting what she was witnessing in the war zones for a film — the final product, “Overcoming the Darkness,” premiered in June 2022 — and after having hesitated for years, founded a film-production company, 2Brave Productions, with her friend Natalia Libet.</p><p>Having to tell Mr. Bregman that she wouldn’t evacuate and would be working in the most dangerous parts of the country, Ms. Beskhmelnytsina said, was “the hardest part of our relationship.” But, she added, “he respected my decision, and for me it was such a key moment that he knew I won’t change my mind and he supported me.”</p><p>On the other side of the Atlantic, Mr. Bregman was deeply worried, but wanted Ms. Beskhmelnytsina to do what she thought was right. Still, he said, “I would wake up every morning and check when was the last time she was online.”</p><p>This was how he knew she was still alive, even if she hadn’t had a chance to message him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The ceremony was led by their friend, Oksana Nechyporenko.

She has a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in international economics from the Ukrainian State University of Finance and International Trade, and a second master’s degree in film directing from the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Since 2023, she has been the chairwoman of the Ukrainian Film Academy. One of the recent projects she co-produced is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/movies/new-directors-new-films.html" title="">Intercepted</a>,” a documentary that premiered at the Berlinale International Film Festival in February and interweaves recordings of Russian soldiers speaking on the phone with scenes of life and destruction in Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Bregman, 44, an engine designer for professional motor sport, was born and raised in New York City. He has a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Yale, and two master’s degrees, one in electrical engineering from Princeton and one in real estate development from the NYU School of Professional Studies.</p><p>At 6, he told his parents he wanted to build cars, and in college, he began working in the industry. He founded an engineering firm, Ayton Performance, in 2004, and since then, cars Ayton has worked on have won at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans and Rolex 24 at Daytona races, among others.</p><p>Ms. Beskhmelnytsina and Mr. Bregman first met in October 2019 at the wedding of a mutual friend, Alina Rudya. At the time, both were in relationships, but that changed by October 2021, when Ms. Rudya invited them to the Spanish island of Majorca to celebrate her and her husband’s second wedding anniversary.</p><p>It took Mr. Bregman four days to gather the courage to try to get Ms. Beskhmelnytsina alone.</p><p>“My big move was when we were at the marina, I said, ‘Hey, I left my sunscreen at the house, do you want to come with me to the pharmacy to get some?’” Mr. Bregman said. She said yes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Later that day, when they were at a cafe with their friends, the captain of the boat the group had chartered told them they looked like they were in love and would be married in a few years.</p><p>“We had our first kiss that night,” Mr. Bregman said.</p><p>Though they were hesitant to engage in a long-distance relationship, the two stayed in touch over Telegram.</p><p>“At that point, I was single in my 40s and feeling kind of down on myself, and to find someone who’s cool, but also amazing, talented, thoughtful, successful, and a kind human who was interested in me helped me realize that life wasn’t over,” Mr. Bregman said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Over the last year, Olha and I have been to 17 different countries,” Mr. Bregman said.

Now, he and Ms. Beskhmelnytsina split their time equally between Kyiv and New York (a fact that he’s confirmed with his spreadsheet).</p><p>The couple were legally married Sept. 7 by Yulia Logai, the director of civil service acts in the Lviv region of Ukraine. Their wedding ceremony on Sept. 14 at the Edem Resort spa in Strilky was led by their friend, Oksana Nechyporenko. Sixty-five guests attended, with about half arriving from outside the country.</p><p>The resort is in one of the safer regions of Ukraine, and was also the first place Mr. Bregman visited with Ms. Beskhmelnytsina on his initial trip to Ukraine.</p><p>“If we choose to have a wedding in Ukraine, my friends and family can choose to come or not, and if we have a wedding outside of Ukraine, many of her family don’t have the choice,” Mr. Bregman said. “For me it was obvious to give the choice rather than to take it away.”</p><p>On the first evening of their celebrations, Mr. Bregman and Ms. Beskhmelnytsina hosted a welcome dinner with traditional Ukrainian dishes like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/world/europe/russia-ukraine-borscht.html" title="">borscht</a> soup and vareniki, a type of dumpling; drinks like horseradish-infused vodka; and folk music. The ceremony was held the next day on a covered terrace and was followed by a cocktail hour in the resort’s palais and a reception in the resort’s grand hall.</p><p>Mr. Bregman wore a custom tuxedo by Alan David with a painting by his mother, an accomplished artist, printed on the inner silk lining of the jacket and the waistcoat. Ms. Beskhmelnytsina wore one dress by Pronovias for the ceremony and a second one custom-made by her friend Oksana Ostrovskaya, of the brand Sana, for the reception.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>A surprise came a few days earlier when Ms. Beskhmelnytsina learned her cousin, Eugene Kolomyets, a Ukrainian soldier who was injured fighting on the front lines, would arrive from the hospital “just in time to make the wedding,” Mr. Bregman said.</p><p>At the ceremony, “he wheeled himself right into the dance floor to join us.”</p><p>The party continued into the wee hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eugene Kolomyets, a Ukrainian soldier who was injured fighting on the front lines, arrived from the hospital “just in time to make the wedding,” Mr. Bregman said. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alina Rudya</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><hr/><h3 id="link-52899010"><span><strong>On This Day</strong></span></h3><p><strong>When</strong> Sept. 14, 2024</p><p><strong>Where</strong> Edem Resort &amp; Spa, Strilky, Ukraine</p><p><strong>Nods to the USA</strong> Ms. Beskhmelnytsina grew up watching American films and wanted to incorporate some of the traditions she had seen into the wedding, including not allowing Mr. Bregman to see her in her dress before the ceremony, serving mini burgers at midnight and having a “getaway car” from which she tossed a bouquet to her friends.</p><p>“When we asked about a getaway car, they suggested all these luxury cars,” Mr. Bregman said. “But we’re trying to keep it cozy and friendly, and not showy.” Eventually, they decided on a 1991 burgundy Nissan Figaro.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>Animal Signs </strong>In a nod to Mr. Bregman’s father’s side of the family, the cake topper was of a blonde woman in a wedding dress with a moose in a tuxedo. “Our family logo is the moose,” Mr. Bregman said.
