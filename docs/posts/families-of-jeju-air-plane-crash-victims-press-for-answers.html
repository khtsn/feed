Now the terminal at Muan International Airport serves as a community center for grieving relatives of the 179 people who perished in the crash. Families gather here to talk, eat together — some even stay overnight in tents.</p><p>It was in that cavernous building in southwestern South Korea that the families <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/world/asia/south-korea-plane-crash-victims.html" title="">waited</a> anxiously for news after Jeju Air Flight 7C2216 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/asia/south-korea-plane-crash-jeju.html" title="">crash-landed</a> on Dec. 29. Then there were tears and outbursts of anger as officials periodically read out the names of the dead, many identified by DNA tests.</p><p>“We’re a family now,” said Son Joo-taek, who lost his son in the accident and was among around 20 people who sat around a row of folding tables that held water and snacks on a recent Saturday. “The people here understand what others just can’t.”</p><p>Lately, the talk among some of the grieving families has turned toward action: They want to find out what caused the crash. The jet — carrying mostly vacationers home from a year-end trip to Thailand — belly-flopped onto the runway and sped along until it hit a concrete berm and exploded into flames, leaving just two survivors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Relatives of those killed say they are unhappy with the trickle of information from officials, and the refusal to release records, including transcripts from the control tower. They want to know more about the reports of a bird strike a few minutes before the landing, how the jet came down without its landing gear, and why the berm it hit was not designed to give way.</p><p>In desperation, some have turned to books and videos to learn about aviation safety, including how flight recorders, air traffic controllers, localizers and jet engines work. They are also looking into airport design.</p><p>“The families’ first priority is to get the truth,” Son Ha-yang, the daughter of Mr. Son, said at the airport where her brother and his girlfriend were killed. “Otherwise, we’re only relying on the investigators, who often use jargon.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-3"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/12/multimedia/00int-jejuair-victims-02-hkmg/00int-jejuair-victims-02-hkmg-jumbo.jpg"/><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Chang W.

Among them: The jet’s flight recorders stopped recording for the final four minutes of the flight.</p><p>“The families want to know why their loved ones died,” said Park Cheol, a lawyer for the families. “They also feel that, by studying, they are making an effort for those who died.”</p><p>Some relatives have challenged officials at meetings over the crash. They say they are concerned there are not enough people investigating the cause, compared with instances in the United States. Nor have the authorities acceded to their request to release communications from the control tower around the time of the crash.</p><p>South Korea’s transport ministry said in a statement that the investigative body was in talks with authorities to increase the number of investigators. The ministry was also considering providing a transcript of the air traffic control communications, though they were not typically released to the public, it said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Kim Yu-jin has been watching YouTube videos and reading books about past aviation disasters since her parents and her brother died in the crash.

But a last-minute offer from a travel agency coincided with their wedding anniversary, Mr. Lee said.</p><p>Coming to the airport is a way for some families to find a sense of community when their homes are now defined by absence. Others stay away from the airport, fearing the memories will be too painful, or constrained by work.</p><p>The crash left Lee Bong-kyung with a struggling shipyard in the southwestern city of Mokpo that was founded by his father in 2015.
