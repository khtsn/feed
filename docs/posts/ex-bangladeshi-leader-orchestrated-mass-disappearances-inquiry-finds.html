Victims who had spent years in underground cells without seeing daylight came out to share their stories, including in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/asia/bangladesh-disappeared.html" title="">detailed accounts in The New York Times</a>.</p><p>Members of the commission, led by a retired judge, Mainul Islam Chowdhury, said they had received more than 1,600 reports of enforced disappearances since they began their work in late August, but they estimated the actual number of victims, mostly political opponents and dissenting voices, at two or three times that.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The report said that the practice had a “central command structure” and “was systematically designed over 15 years to remain undetectable.” It operated in a top-down manner, implicating Ms. Hasina and her closest lieutenants, most of whom have fled the country.</p><p>The commission identified at least eight secret facilities where detainees had been held, and relays accounts of what it described as institutionalized torture.</p><p>In a preliminary report presented on Saturday to Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate in economics who is Bangladesh’s interim leader, it called for the disbanding of the Rapid Action Battalion, which had started as a counterterrorism force with U.S. and British training but became notorious for widespread abuses.</p><p>“We collected eyewitness accounts, chain-of-command details and information about how directives were issued,” said Nur Khan Liton, a member of the commission. “These details were gathered from individuals who were directly involved.”</p><p>Leaders of Ms. Hasina’s party rejected the commission’s findings as politically motivated, saying it was an effort to tarnish her strong record of combating terrorism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“This is a made-up story,” said A.F.M. Bahauddin Nasim, a senior leader of her party, the Awami League. “It is nothing but to mislead, to assassinate her character and to diminish her in front of people.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sanjida Islam Tulee, seated in gray, a leader of Mayer Daak, an organization for the families of the victims of enforced disappearances.

One of the river sites had a boat that was “modified for use in these nefarious operations,” the report said.</p><p>Those who were released to their families were often let go on condition of staying silent, but only after they were charged with fabricated crimes that not only absolved the abductors but also ensured a pressure point to maintain that silence, the report found.</p><p>Mr. Liton, the commission member, said investigators estimated that the real number of victims could be two or three times the 1,600 complaints registered so far, because many still remain in fear of the units that carried out the abductions.</p><p>Nabila Idris, another member of the commission, said the fact that only some individuals of cases with clear multiple victims had officially registered a complaint, and that cases of women as well as victims from remote regions had remained “largely underreported,” led them to believe the numbers are much larger.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Liton said the commission was careful to avoid identifying details to ensure the safety of the victims.</p><p>“Bangladesh does not have any victim protection law,” he said. “So we had to be cautious.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mujib-mashal">More about Mujib Mashal</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
