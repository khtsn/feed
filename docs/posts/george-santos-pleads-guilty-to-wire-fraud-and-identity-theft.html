Mr. Santos repeatedly insisted that he would defend his innocence in court, only to reverse course as the opportunity approached.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/nyregion/george-santos-lies-charges.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/19/nyregion/santos-project-promo/santos-project-promo-articleLarge.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Guilty Plea, Lies and Questions in the George Santos Scandal</h2><p>George Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023, told so many stories they could be hard to keep straight. We broke them down.</p></div></a></div></div><div><p>The Mr. Santos who appeared in court bore little resemblance to the shameless provocateur whose antics grabbed headlines. On Monday, that bravado was replaced by a wavering voice and words of contrition. </p></div><div><div><p>“I accept full responsibility for my actions,” he told the judge as he admitted to participating in a scheme to “artificially inflate” the number of contributions to his campaign to win support from the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p><p>“I understand my actions have betrayed the trust of my supporters and my constituents,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Santos’s sentencing was postponed until Feb. 7, meaning he will not have to report to prison for at least six months. Guidelines call for him to serve as many as eight years in prison, though a judge could decide to be more lenient.</p><p>Mr. Santos also agreed to pay $373,749.97 in restitution and forfeit another $205,002.97 before his sentencing. Mr. Santos will need to come up with the money for his final plea deal to go through, and if he is unable to do so his property will be seized.</p><p>The outcome was welcome news to Republicans in New York, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/avlon-lalota-residency-congress.html" title="">the party is preparing to defend a half dozen swing seats</a> that could decide the House majority.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The party already lost control of Mr. Santos’s seat, representing parts of Queens and Long Island, to Democrats in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/13/nyregion/pilip-suozzi-santos-election.html" title="">a special election in February</a>, held after Mr. Santos was expelled from Congress. But a high-profile trial would have also cast a shadow over other races on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley.</p><p>The criminal investigation into Mr. Santos began after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/nyregion/george-santos-ny-republicans.html" title="">The New York Times reported</a> that much of his biography and aspects of his campaign’s finances appeared to have been fabricated.</p><p>Additional reporting from The Times and other news organizations revealed a bizarre array of lies: from inane claims of playing volleyball in college to fundamental deceptions about his education, résumé and cultural heritage.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Santos was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/nyregion/george-santos-charges.html" title="">charged with 23 felony counts</a> for a number of schemes, including stealing money from donors and lying to the government to cover his tracks. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>Prosecutors painted Mr. Santos’s campaign as so desperate for cash that it turned to lying, cheating and stealing to finance its operations. But they also assert a pattern of self-dealing, which saw Mr. Santos repeatedly using his campaign account as a personal piggy bank.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Prosecutors said Mr. Santos used one donor’s credit card information to steal $11,000 for his personal use. He convinced other donors to contribute to what he said was a super PAC supporting his campaign. Instead, he used some of the money to buy designer clothing and pay his personal credit card bills.</p><p>Mr. Santos was accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/nyregion/george-santos-nancy-marks.html" title="">falsifying campaign finance records</a> to include a $500,000 loan to his campaign that never existed in order to qualify for financial and operational support from the national Republican Party. His campaign treasurer, Nancy Marks, previously admitted to having helped Mr. Santos falsify the records. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/nyregion/santos-accountant-nancy-marks-guilty.html" title="">pleaded guilty</a> to one felony count in October and faces up to four years in prison.</p><p>And Mr. Santos was also charged with unemployment fraud and lying on House financial disclosure documents.</p><p>Mr. Santos burst onto the national political scene in 2022 when he flipped New York’s Third Congressional District and helped his party win control of the House.</p><p>At the time, he was heralded as a new kind of Republican. Young, Latino and gay, Mr. Santos was a proud adherent of former President Donald J. Trump who embraced his attention-grabbing style of politics and widely debunked claims of election interference.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But even before he was sworn in, Mr. Santos’s lies began to unravel. After reports of irregularities with his campaign finances, investigators initiated a probe that culminated with a 13-count indictment. Subsequent charges were later added after Ms. Marks pleaded guilty to conspiracy.</p><p>Despite the legal headwinds, Mr. Santos remained in Congress until late last year, when a report from the bipartisan House Ethics Committee revealed that he had not only defrauded donors, but had used the ill-gotten gains to buy designer goods and Botox.</p><p>Republicans joined Democrats to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/01/nyregion/santos-expulsion-vote-congress.html" title="">expel him from Congress</a> in December, making Mr. Santos one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/nyregion/expelled-congress-members-george-santos.html" title="">only six congressmen</a> in the nation’s history to be kicked out of office. More than two-thirds of his colleagues in the House voted in favor of expulsion, including more than 100 Republicans.</p><p>For a while, Mr. Santos remained defiant and seemed to revel in the attention engendered by his fall from grace. He threatened retribution on Republican lawmakers who turned on him and began selling short, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/us/politics/george-santos-cameo.html" title="">personalized video messages on the app Cameo</a>, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. He also began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/nyregion/george-santos-documentary-fyre.html" title="">filming a documentary</a>.</p><p>All the while, Mr. Santos dismissed his criminal case as a “witch hunt,” echoing Mr. Trump’s defense against his own legal troubles.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But as the moneymaking media appearances and legal filings suggested, he was also facing financial calamity. It was never clear how — or if — Mr. Santos was paying his legal bills.</p><p>In the past week, Mr. Santos, whose <a href="https://twitter.com/mrsantosny" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bio on X</a> now describes him as an “opinion writer at large,” has signaled that he might be ready to change his tune.</p><p>Amid posts about a fragrance line and the newest “Alien” movie, Mr. Santos seemed to suggest that he might retreat from public life, writing “I’m done” with an emoji of a peace sign.</p><p>That same day, he quoted the poet Maya Angelou, saying: “It may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from.”</p><p>Alyce McFadden<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Grace Ashford covers New York government and politics for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/grace-ashford">More about Grace Ashford</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Michael Gold is a political correspondent for The Times covering the campaigns of Donald J.
