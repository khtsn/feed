The monthly income she listed for herself and her son was too high for her to qualify, she said.</p><p>Instead, Ms. Young was guided to a table with a potential alternative: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/politics/biden-georgia-medicaid-obamacare.html" title="">a new Medicaid program called Georgia Pathways to Coverage</a>, which required enrollees with incomes up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level to work, study or do community service for at least 80 hours a month to secure coverage.</p><p>Pathways, which has drawn anemic enrollment ahead of its scheduled expiration next year, is the subject of an intense legal and philosophical battle over the future of Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that accounts for roughly 10 percent of the federal budget and covers around 75 million Americans, most of them lower income.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Biden administration quickly <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-work-a-look-at-what-the-data-say/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">withdrew the Trump administration’s approvals</a> of work requirements in state Medicaid programs and has sought to block Georgia from advancing Pathways.

Trump wins the White House in November.</p><p>Democrats have seized on the future of the program at a key moment in the campaign.</p><p>“Let’s finally expand Medicaid in Georgia so people can take their child to a doctor or go to an emergency room without going into medical debt,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a recent campaign speech in Savannah, Ga.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who as president called for major cuts to Medicaid in his budget proposals, has said little about how he might reshape the safety net program. At the presidential debate this week, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/us/politics/trump-obamacare.html" title="">suggested he had “concepts of a plan”</a> to change the Affordable Care Act that he would soon share, which he could use to call for large reductions in Medicaid spending.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Edwin Park, a Medicaid expert at Georgetown University, said that a fight in Congress next year over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/tax-code-congress.html" title="">expiring tax measures</a> signed into law by Mr. Trump in 2017 could lead lawmakers to hunt for large cuts from federal health programs.</p><p>“And where would you go except for Medicaid?” Mr. Park said. “If we take former President Trump’s claims at face value about protecting Medicare and Social Security, Medicaid would be the largest source of savings.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J.

Around a dozen states received permission from the Trump administration to enforce work requirements in their Medicaid programs, but were <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/section-1115-waiver-tracker-work-requirements/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">halted by the Biden administration</a>.</p><p>Republicans have also called for limiting federal funds that states receive for their Medicaid programs or recipients, a practice known as block granting or per capita caps. The Trump administration in 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/medicaid-block-grant-trump.html" title="">began allowing such a plan</a>.</p><p>And they have proposed reducing the share of Medicaid spending that the federal government covers, or the so-called matching rate. Under Medicaid expansion, which covers poor adults, the federal government picks up 90 percent of the cost, making the option attractive even to Republican-led states. </p><p>States losing a greater share of federal funding in Medicaid may have to increase their own spending to make up the difference, or make large cuts to Medicaid.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Major changes in those matching rates could also induce states to reverse their expansions of the program, something that Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/upshot/the-gop-bill-forces-states-to-build-health-systems-from-scratch-thats-hard.html" title="">sought during Mr. Trump’s first term</a>. Some Republican state lawmakers, <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/02/01/after-wide-opposition-idaho-bill-that-would-likely-repeal-medicaid-expansion-held-in-committee/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including in Idaho</a>, have already begun considering such a move.</p><p>Pathways, which has used primarily federal funds, is styled as a rebuttal to Medicaid expansion, showcasing the Republican emphasis on personal responsibility as a condition of publicly subsidized health care.</p><p>But health policy experts have said that the approach essentially punishes people like Ms. Young, putting lower-income people managing complicated lives in limbo unless they can flash their pay stubs.</p><p>The program has served as a warning sign of how those reforms are put into practice. By July, a year into the Pathways program, fewer than 4,500 people had signed up — a fraction of the roughly 168,000 who state officials have estimated are eligible to enroll.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Georgia’s Medicaid agency did not respond to follow-up questions on more recent Pathways enrollment figures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The goal of Georgia Pathways is not — and has never been — to keep hundreds of thousands of Georgians on government-run health care forever,” Brian Kemp, the state’s Republican governor, said at a <a href="https://madmimi.com/p/c1678a1?pact=1418670-183249663-14226241609-0515e9e790a9b5bcf16265c051898b2f8c264521" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent health care round-table event</a>. He said that coverage was meant to be “a pathway to an education, a job, a career and a better life without government assistance.”</p><p>Critics of Pathways have pointed to a contradiction in the program: To reduce the role of the federal government in health care, the state orchestrated an expensive federally funded government program that spent little on health care. As of March 31, roughly $25 million of the $32.5 million spent on the program had been for administrative costs.</p><p>Leah Chan, a health policy expert at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a nonprofit research firm, said that those administrative costs meant the state was spending significantly more to insure someone in Pathways than it would through traditional Medicaid expansion.</p><p>“The most fiscally responsible decision is to close the coverage gap,” she said, referring to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/how-many-uninsured-are-in-the-coverage-gap-and-how-many-could-be-eligible-if-all-states-adopted-the-medicaid-expansion/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roughly 175,000 people</a> in Georgia who earn too much to qualify for the state’s Medicaid program but not enough for heavily subsidized plans on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>North Carolina has enrolled <a href="https://medicaid.ncdhhs.gov/reports/medicaid-expansion-dashboard" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than half a million people</a> through Medicaid expansion less than a year after the state made them eligible.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gov.

Around 400,000 people who had been in Medicaid now had plans on the marketplace that provide “better coverage, with more options, while saving taxpayer dollars,” Mr. Kemp said at the round table event.</p><p>State officials have stood by the Pathways program, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/health-news/kemp-commits-107-million-to-advertise-pathways-medicaid-program/3JNOFMZSTJEPVCVIP6B4QJVMQA/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcing a more than $10 million marketing campaign</a> last month in an effort to juice enrollment.</p><p>At one recent enrollment event in a government building next to the State Capitol, a small group of contractors recruiting people to the program handed out Pathways-branded hand sanitizer, first-aid kits, umbrellas and ponchos.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Coverage often gives recipients access to other safety net programs. Diamond Carter, a 23-year-old Pathways recipient from Atlanta who is raising a daughter, said her enrollment had given her access to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, a federally funded program know as WIC that covers the cost of groceries.</p><p>“I can log in anytime and apply for anything I need,” Ms. Carter said, referring to the web portal she uses for Pathways.</p><p>Ms. Young, the potential Pathways recipient, said she racked up a roughly $30,000 bill at a private Atlanta hospital before being transferred to a public hospital that typically treats the uninsured. She remained there last week, and planned to finish her Pathways application as soon as she is able to, she said.</p><p>A part-time job she started would most likely not come with health insurance, Ms. Young noted. She hoped to work around 80 hours a month while juggling her health problems, leaving her barely at the threshold for Pathways eligibility.</p><p>“How are you supposed to survive?” she asked.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Noah Weiland writes about health care for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noah-weiland">More about Noah Weiland</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
