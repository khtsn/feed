    <h1>China Stage 2 groups drawn</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>The groups for VCT China have been redrawn ahead of Stage 2, rearranging the groups from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2359/champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1/group-stage" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>. This was done because the group stage results for each stage are now independent from one another as opposed to last year, where teams&#39; records from the two stages were combined when qualifying teams to the Stage 2 playoffs. This change alters the impact of teams&#39; strength of schedule when determining their chances at qualifying for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions 2025</a>.</p>

<p>Group Alpha:</p>



<p>Group Omega:</p>



<p>The seeding for these groups was determined purely based on each team&#39;s regular season results in Stage 1. A random draw was then conducted to determine which seeds would swap groups from Stage 1. For example, only one pair of teams between the #5 seeds and #6 seeds was drawn to be swapped, and the other pair was left in their original group. In this case, the #5 seeds of FPX and JDG were swapped, meaning that the #6 seeds of TYLOO and All Gamers were left alone. This process was repeated for the #3 and #4 seeds, with the #4 seeds of Nova and TEC switching groups. Lastly, the #2 seeds of DRG and BLG were drawn and swapped to create the finalized groups. </p>
