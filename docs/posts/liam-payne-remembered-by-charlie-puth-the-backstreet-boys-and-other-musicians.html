Charlie Puth, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/arts/music/charlie-puth-voicenotes-interview.html" title="">the pop singer</a> and songwriter, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/charlieputh/3480405209492927326/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on Instagram</a>, that he was “in shock” at the news. Payne was “one of the first major artists I got to work with. I cannot believe he is gone,” Puth added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Payne in Dubai in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Atlantis The Royal</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Words cannot express the emotions we are collectively feeling right now,” the Backstreet Boys <a href="https://x.com/backstreetboys/status/1846742830447829066" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, adding “our hearts go out to Liam’s family, friends and Directioners around the world.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Life is short and fragile,” the German DJ Zedd, who released the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbW14E2eHJ0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get Low</a>” with Payne in 2017, wrote <a href="https://x.com/Zedd/status/1846672783235076425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a>. “RIP Liam … I can’t believe this is real …”</p><p>The reaction was especially strong in Britain, where Payne built his career. Among those to express condolences on social media were <a href="https://x.com/SPetersAcademy/status/1846844996864868797" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his childhood school</a> and <a href="https://x.com/WBA/status/1846803901418217791" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">West Bromwich Albion</a>, the soccer team Payne supported.</p><p>Payne first auditioned on the British talent show “The X Factor” as a solo artist in 2008, but found success when he returned in 2010, even though the group placed third in the show. Simon Cowell, the music executive and television personality, created One Direction by bringing Payne together with Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson. </p><p>In 2011, One Direction’s debut single, “What Makes You Beautiful,” hit No. 4 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. The band released five albums and became one of the defining boy bands of the early 2010s. In 2015, One Direction announced it would take a break from performing together, and the group officially split up a year later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As of Thursday morning, none of Payne’s former bandmates had issued public reactions to the news of his death, and their representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Cowell also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>But on Instagram, Styles’s mother, Anne Twist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBNIp_1ITDv/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a picture</a> of a broken heart emoji, with the caption “Just a boy …”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Marshall is a Times reporter covering European culture.
