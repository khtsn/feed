He was visibly shaken after seeing the Coast Guard’s initial presentation on the long series of problems that plagued the Titan in the months and years before the voyage, and called the problems “disturbing.”</p><p>Mr. Nissen said he was fired in 2019 after he refused to approve an expedition to the Titanic wreckage that year because he deemed the Titan’s hull to be unsafe. OceanGate, he said, lied about the problems, and instead blamed the cancellation of that mission on problems with a support ship.</p><p>“It wasn’t true,” he said. “We didn’t have a hull.”</p><p>He described an earlier instance, in April of 2018, when the Titan was apparently struck by lightning while in the Bahamas for testing. He told the chief executive of OceanGate, Stockton Rush, who later died in the implosion, that there was a good chance that the strike had compromised the Titan’s hull. Mr. Nissen said Mr. Rush refused to believe him, insisting, “It’ll be OK.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When Mr. Nissen was asked at the hearing why the company did not make any effort to comply with certification or regulatory standards for the vessel, he said the company’s founder did not show any interest.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say there was no effort,” he said. “There was no desire by Stockton to go do it.”</p><p>A second witness, Bonnie Carl, a former finance director at the company, said she left in February 2018 over safety concerns. Those concerns included questions that she heard expressed about the design, and seeing people she described as young engineers in their late teens or early 20s who were “wrenching on the sub” with no supervision.</p><p>“It became abundantly clear to me that OceanGate was not the place I wanted to work, if that was their attitude toward safety,” she said.</p><p>The hearing’s “basic factual information” about the disaster, detailed in <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Sep/16/2003544483/-1/-1/0/CG%20001%20OVERVIEW%20PRESENTATION%20TITAN%20%20V5%2015%20.PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lengthy report</a> at the outset on Monday, did not make clear whether the submersible’s crew members knew they were in mortal danger. The report states that “throughout the descent,” the crew sent “no transmissions which indicated trouble or any emergency.”</p><p>The report goes on to recount the terse communications between the submersible and its mother ship as the vessel neared the bottom. The Titan reported that it had “dropped two wts,” a reference to the weights that help the craft descend. That communication was cited by some observers in the immediate aftermath of the Titan disaster as a sign that the people on board may have known of their peril and were trying to make an emergency ascent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Tym Catterson, a contractor for OceanGate who helped launch the submersible on the day of its implosion, testified on Monday that he was sure Mr. Rush had dropped the two weights — totaling just 70 pounds — to ease the vessel’s landing and better control it, not to return to the surface.</p><p>“It’s not enough weight to come back up,” Mr. Catterson said of the two dropped weights. “He’s just shedding weight to slow down.”</p><p>The crew was not heard from again. At that point, the Titan was more than two miles below the surface of the Atlantic. About 30 minutes earlier, they had sent a message saying, “all good here.”</p><p>Exactly what led to the implosion has been the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/science/titan-submersible-transcript-investigation.html" title="">subject of an inquiry</a> by the Coast Guard for more than a year. But much of that work has taken place out of view, with few new disclosures about what went wrong. Monday’s public proceeding began with an overview of the investigation and an animation of the submersible that illustrated what investigators had learned so far.</p><p>In all, two dozen witnesses are expected to testify before the board over the next two weeks. Among them are former employees of OceanGate and safety and marine experts who have insight into what caused the fatal event. The board is also likely to discuss evidence it has already gathered, including details about the Titan’s design and the company’s safety guidelines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The witness list for the hearing does not include some key experts and officials associated with the Titan and OceanGate.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/29/science/scientist-work-alfred-mclaren-explorer-arctic-depths-plans-another-trip-north.html" title="">Alfred S. McLaren</a>, a retired Navy submariner, submersible pilot and president emeritus of the Explorers Club, said the failure to include more recent OceanGate officials in the witness list could raise questions about the credibility of the report’s eventual conclusions.</p><p>“Where are the other experts?” he asked in an interview. He noted, however, that the Coast Guard hearing board has the ability to continue its investigations in private and, if it chooses, to schedule more public hearings, which past inquiries have done.</p><p>“It’s not complete,” Dr. McLaren said of <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Sep/09/2003539914/-1/-1/0/WITNESS%20LIST-%20TITAN%20MARINE%20BOARD%20OF%20INVESTIGATION%20HEARING%20WEBSITE%20LISTING.PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the current roster</a> of two dozen witnesses. “They have to keep digging.”</p><p>The biggest question for investigators is what caused the Titan to implode, an answer that is crucial to preventing any future accidents. They will specifically try to determine if there were flaws in the design of the submersible or the materials it was built with.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Years before the implosion, Mr. Rush was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/us/oceangate-titanic-missing-submersible.html" title="">warned</a> by submersible and ocean experts that his methods were still experimental and could have devastating results.</p><p>Since the accident, experts have noted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/14/us/titan-submersible-implode-design.html" title="">several design decisions</a> that may have saved the company money but meant that the submersible would differ from others that had proved safe. Among those decisions were the pill-like shape of the Titan’s hull — a sphere has been the industry standard — and the use of carbon fiber rather than titanium for the hull.</p><p>At a news conference on Sunday, Jason Neubauer, a retired Coast Guard captain who is the chairman of the board investigating the Titan, said his team had been working for 15 months to understand the disaster. He said that the hearing this week and next in North Charleston, S.C., would be crucial.</p><p>“These proceedings are not just a formality,” he said. “They are a critical step in our missions to understand the contributing factors that led to the incident, and, even more important, the actions needed to prevent a similar occurrence.”</p><p>Captain Neubauer said the investigation was one of the most complex he had ever participated in, partly because the implosion took place far out at sea, making it more difficult to gather the physical remnants of the destroyed craft.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Responding to a reporter’s question, he said that any potential evidence of criminal negligence would be passed on to the U.S. Justice Department.</p><p>The Titan submersible disappeared on June 18, 2023, when it lost communication with its support ship after dropping into the water about 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. On board were Mr. Rush; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/world/asia/shahzada-dawood-titan-submersible.html" title="">Shahzada Dawood</a>, a British Pakistani businessman; Mr. Dawood’s 19-year-old son, Suleman; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/us/hamish-harding-dead.html" title="">Hamish Harding</a>, a British aviation tycoon and explorer; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/us/paul-henri-nargeolet-dead.html" title="">Paul-Henri Nargeolet</a>, a French maritime expert and leading authority on the Titanic who had visited the wreckage dozens of times before.</p><p>Mr. Nargeolet’s family sued OceanGate last month, saying that the company’s chief executive had misled Mr. Nargeolet about the craft’s safety. OceanGate suspended commercial and exploratory operations in the wake of the accident.</p><p>Four days after the submersible vanished, wreckage from the craft was found about a third of a mile from the bow of the Titanic. Months later, divers found human remains among debris.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reports on national stories across the United States with a focus on criminal justice.
