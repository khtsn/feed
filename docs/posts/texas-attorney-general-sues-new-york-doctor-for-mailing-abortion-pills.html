It appeared to be among the first attempts to stop the mailing of such medication into states that ban abortion.</p><p>The lawsuit from Attorney General Ken Paxton — filed on Thursday in state court in Collin County, north of Dallas — pits the laws of Texas, which has a near-total ban on abortion, against those of New York, where lawmakers have taken steps to shield doctors from out-of-state prosecution.</p><p>Under shield laws, states like New York will refuse to cooperate with attempts by other states to prosecute or sue abortion providers who prescribe and send pills across state lines. Such <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/health/abortion-shield-laws-telemedicine.html" title="">laws exist</a> in eight states and have allowed doctors there to send more than 10,000 abortion pills per month to women in states with bans.</p><p>But legal experts say they expect Texas to try to pursue its case even if it is rebuffed by New York’s law. Such an effort could wind up in federal court, potentially imperiling the ability of women in other states with bans to receive abortion pills by mail, and becoming a major test of whether states can enforce contradictory laws across state lines.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It’s a huge deal,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. “Shield doctors mailing pills into ban states was always going to be, I think, both the most consequential in terms of access to abortion and the highest risk.”</p><p>In a statement on Friday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said that she was “committed to maintaining New York’s status as a safe harbor for all who seek abortion care.”</p><p>“Make no mistake,” she added. “I will do everything in my power to enforce the laws of New York State.”</p><p>Ms. Ziegler said that the case could play out in several ways. She said that New York’s shield law had a provision that allows the doctor being sued, or possibly the state, to countersue against Texas, so the case could end up with dueling lawsuits.</p><p>If, as expected, the case ends up in federal court, she said, Texas might argue that shield laws cannot be enforced because the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution requires states to respect other states’ laws. But, Ms. Ziegler said, some legal experts who support shield laws say the laws constitute a “public policy exception” to that clause.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/health/abortion-pills.html" title="">use of abortion medication has grown</a> since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. One study found that medication is now used in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/health/abortion-pills.html" title="">nearly two-thirds of all abortions</a>.</p><p>Already, abortion providers have become concerned that a 151-year-old federal anti-vice law known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/us/comstock-act-1978-abortion-pill.html" title="">Comstock Act</a> could be revived by the incoming Trump administration. The law, which has been rarely enforced, prohibits the mailing of “obscene, lewd or lascivious” materials, like pornography, or any item “intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion.”</p><p>In 2022, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/opinions/attachments/2023/01/03/2022-12-23_-_comstock_act_1.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concluded that</a> abortion medication could be sent by mail if the sender did not intend for the recipient to use them unlawfully. Abortion opponents have been pushing for the incoming administration to rescind that interpretation and say that the act bans all mailing of abortion pills.</p><p>In the Texas suit, Mr. Paxton said that Dr. Margaret Daley Carpenter of New Paltz, N.Y., provided two medications to a 20-year-old woman in Texas that “resulted in a medical abortion” over the summer. The two medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, are widely used together to end pregnancies up to 12 weeks.</p><p>In July, the woman asked the “biological father of her unborn child” to take her to the emergency room because of “severe bleeding,” and it was there that he first learned that she was nine weeks pregnant, according to the lawsuit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The man “suspected that the biological mother had in fact done something to contribute to the miscarriage,” the suit said, and he went back to their home in Collin County, where he “discovered the two above-referenced medications from Carpenter.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Misoprostol, which is used to end pregnancies.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sophie Park for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dr. Carpenter specializes in reproductive health and is a co-founder of the <a href="https://www.theactgroup.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine</a>, an organization that assists doctors in states where abortion is legal with interstate telemedicine in order to “close the abortion accessibility gap,” according to the group’s website.</p><p>She is not licensed to practice medicine in Texas, according to the suit. A colleague of Dr. Carpenter’s said on Friday that Dr. Carpenter would not be commenting on the case.</p><p>But the colleague, Dr. Linda Prine, who has been open about prescribing abortion pills under New York’s shield law, said: “Maggie has been providing legally protected abortion care, protected by the State of New York, to people who are greatly in need. Texas has no jurisdiction over us in New York State. Abortion is a human right.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Paxton said he was seeking to have the court stop Dr. Carpenter from continuing to provide abortion medication to patients in Texas, and to apply Texas’ ban on abortion to her. The ban carries a penalty of at least $100,000 for each violation.</p><p>It was not clear how Mr. Paxton would seek to enforce the state law against a New York doctor. His office did not respond to a request to discuss the suit.</p><p>David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has helped draft and lobby for shield laws, including New York’s, said the suit was precisely what the shield laws were meant to cover.</p><p>“Texas has no jurisdiction over Maggie Carpenter,” Mr. Cohen said. “She is not physically present there. The courts cannot order her to do anything, and they cannot get the assistance of the New York courts to order her to do anything because of the shield law.”</p><p>But anti-abortion groups were already celebrating the legal challenge.</p><p>“If Texas wins, this case could open the door for the state to take further legal action against one of the largest organizations in the illegal abortion cartel: Aid Access,” said Kimberlyn Schwartz, director of media and communication for Texas Right to Life, referring to the Europe-based organization that has been at the forefront of telemedicine abortion and has shield-law providers in several states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Katie Daniel, the director of legal affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, applauded Mr. Paxton for “leading the charge to hold out-of-state abortion businesses accountable for preying on Texas’ unborn children and their mothers.”</p><p>It is not the first time that Mr. Paxton has tried to stretch Texas’ ban beyond state borders. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/texas-abortion-medical-records.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">fought in court this year</a> to reverse a rule by the Biden administration that prevents investigators from inspecting the medical records of women who travel out of state for abortions. It was not clear if Mr. Paxton had been seeking such records.</p><p>Ms. Ziegler says the new lawsuit also sets up an interstate battle that is “kind of giving the lie to the whole idea that each state is going to be left to do its own thing,” she said. “That was the winning recipe for the G.O.P. — every state can make its own policy.”</p><p>But with abortion pills being mailed across state lines, she said, the conflicts between conservative and liberal states don’t go away. Instead, they become heightened.</p><p>“The whole ‘each state is going to leave each other state alone’ thing is not an accurate depiction of what any of the states are doing or want to do,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>J.
