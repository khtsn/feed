Her audience posted puzzled and worried reactions, including urgent pleas like “Where did she go?” and “Someone help!”</p><p>The Tokyo police said Wednesday that they had charged Kenji Takano, 42, with murder on suspicion he carried out the attack, which took place the day before in a Tokyo neighborhood popular with university students. They said Mr. Takano, who was arrested at the scene, had admitted to the attack, though he said he didn’t mean to kill her.</p><p>According to the police, Mr. Takano used a survival knife to stab Ms. Sato in the head, neck and torso while she stood looking into her cellphone camera on a busy street. Ms. Sato, a livestreamer who had more than 2,600 followers, was filming herself as she made a circuit of major train stations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Although efforts were made to revive her, Ms. Sato died after arriving at a hospital, police said.</p><p>Violent crimes remain rare on Tokyo’s usually orderly and clean streets, though there have long been concerns of Japan’s social cohesion fraying from growing inequalities, stagnant wages and, more recently, rising prices.</p><p>The police said that they believe this was not a random attack. They said Mr. Takano appears to have been a follower who said he once lent Ms. Sato a large sum of money that she never repaid.</p><p>This may have led Mr. Takano to hold a grudge against Ms. Sato, the police said. While she didn’t disclose beforehand where she would be streaming from, Mr. Takano tracked her down by recognizing the buildings behind her, according to local media reports citing police investigators.</p><p>The aftermath of the attack was also captured elsewhere online, as passers-by posted photos on social media of Ms. Sato lying collapsed and bleeding on the street.</p><p>On her channel in a livestreaming app called WhoWatch, she had often filmed herself while visiting bars and meeting other streamers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This is not the first killing of a female streamer in Japan.
