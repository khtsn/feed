The changes would make it harder to enroll in coverage and, for many, make plans more expensive.</p><p>Republicans say these changes are needed to combat fraud and ensure government dollars go only to those who are eligible. Critics of the policies say they are unnecessary red tape that will cause people to lose coverage just because they couldn’t gather and verify the necessary documents in time.</p><p>Times reporters want to hear from the people who use Obamacare for their health coverage to better understand what some of the Republicans’ proposed changes would look like.
