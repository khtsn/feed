That’s down from a more-than-two-decade high of about 5.33 percent.</p><p>The decision shows that central bankers think they are winning the war against inflation and are now turning their attention to keeping the job market from weakening further.</p><p>“Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said.</p><p>Central bankers expect to cut interest rates more in the months to come, but they are not on a preset path, Powell said. They could speed up if the economy is weak and slow down if it’s strong. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates/fed-rate-cut-takeaways?smid=url-share" title="">Here are key takeaways from the Fed’s decision</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hezbollah supporters mourned the deaths of four fighters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-e2c030e">More devices exploded in Lebanon </h2><p>At least 20 people were killed and hundreds were wounded when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas/here-is-the-latest-on-the-pager-attack?smid=url-share" title="">walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded</a> across Lebanon today, the second attack involving booby-trapped devices in two days, according to Lebanese and Hezbollah officials.</p><p>Lebanon was already reeling from an operation yesterday that blew up thousands of pagers. Those blasts killed at least 12 people and wounded more than 2,700 others. Residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs said the explosions today did not appear to be as widespread as Tuesday’s blasts.</p><p>But the walkie-talkies were nearly three times heavier than the pagers and set off more large fires, suggesting that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-walkie-talkie-explosives.html" title="">they might have contained more explosives</a>, a Times analysis found.</p><p>Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, but its members appeared to be in shock, my colleague <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-pager-lebanon.html" title="">Ben Hubbard reported</a>.

Massive raids? Massive detention camps? What are we talking about?”</p><p>Harris framed herself as a candidate who would focus on lowering prescription drug prices and addressing housing shortages, reflecting her broader strategy to build support among Latinos.
