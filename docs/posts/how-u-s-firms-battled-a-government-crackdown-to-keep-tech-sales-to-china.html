The U.S. firms said that they had already earned $6 billion by selling equipment to those Chinese companies, and that they planned to sell billions more, two government officials said.</p><p>U.S. officials, who view the flow of U.S. technology to Huawei as a national security threat, were stunned by the argument. In regulations issued this month, they ultimately rejected the American companies’ plea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Over the past year, an intense struggle has played out in Washington between companies that sell machinery to make semiconductors and Biden officials who are bent on slowing China’s technological progress. Officials argue that China’s ability to make chips that create artificial intelligence, guide autonomous drones and launch cyberattacks is a national security threat, and they have clamped down on U.S. technology exports, including in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/business/economy/biden-china-chips-exports.html" title="">new rules</a> last week.</p><p>But many in the semiconductor industry have fought to limit the rules and preserve a critical source of revenue, more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials said. Most requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal government interactions or exchanges with the industry.</p><p>The U.S. chip equipment companies argue that they do not oppose stronger rules as long as they also apply to international competitors. Their chief complaint is that the U.S. industry is the only one facing restrictions, allowing companies in Japan and the Netherlands to step in to supply China with technology. That damages U.S. companies while also failing to restrain Beijing, they argue.</p><p>Over the course of this year, the chip equipment companies deployed lobbyists to Capitol Hill and the White House, set up advocacy organizations and funded <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/double-edged-sword-semiconductor-export-controls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supportive research</a> by think tanks to make their argument. They put in dozens of calls to officials and leaned on vulnerable Democrats in Congress, warning of job losses in their districts and asking them to reach out to the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An employee at a semiconductor production plant in Shandong Province in China in April 2024.

Lam Research said in a statement that it “diligently adheres to U.S. export controls” and that it engaged regularly “in constructive dialogue with policymakers on trade-related matters for the benefit of the semiconductor industry, national security and the U.S. innovation economy.”</p><p>Some U.S. officials have privately said that the lobbying undercut their recent rules. It helped feed an argument against the United States taking action by itself and it delayed restrictions on certain Chinese factories, they said, resulting in billions of dollars of additional sales.</p><p>Some officials have had longer-running concerns about industry influence. Eight current and former officials expressed concerns about the close relationship between the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls, and the semiconductor equipment industry, which employs several former officials as executives or legal advisers.</p><p>In recent years, according to four of those officials, some B.I.S. employees inappropriately informed U.S. companies about forthcoming sanctions. That information had sometimes been passed on to Chinese customers, who then stockpiled U.S. products, three of the people said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Other U.S. officials denied that the industry had any influence on the administration’s decisions. Some acknowledge they should move faster, but say they struggle with a lack of resources.</p><p>Alan Estevez, the under secretary for B.I.S., said in an interview that lobbying had no impact on his deliberations. He said his department had worked closely with other agencies and U.S. allies to set tough restrictions that sought to target advanced chip production, not China’s industry overall.</p><p>“National security is my north star,” he said. “There is nothing that industry would ever do that would make me compromise that bottom line.”</p><p>The debate over how best to control technology demonstrates the difficulty for the United States in dealing with China, a military rival but also a crucial trading partner. Many officials believe the chip industry needs to be regulated, but also nurtured: Without its cutting-edge companies, after all, the United States would have no leverage over China at all.</p><p>That relationship between American companies and China could become an even greater source of tension under President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has promised to take aggressive action against the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>China has been investing heavily in technology, and it is currently constructing nearly two dozen new chip factories, U.S. officials say. Beijing has also responded more hostilely to recent U.S. restrictions — including by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html" title="">banning rare earth exports</a> to the United States and by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/china-nvidia-investigation-antitrust-ai.html" title="">starting an investigation</a> into the chip maker Nvidia — potentially presaging a widening conflict over technology and supply chains.</p><p>Many Biden officials agree with the companies that say the United States should work with allies. After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/business/economy/china-us-chip-semiconductors.html" title="">months of negotiations,</a> the administration reached an agreement in September with Japan and the Netherlands to each halt the exports of roughly two dozen types of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to China.</p><p>Speaking at the Reagan Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif., on Dec. 7, Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said the United States had to work with allies to ensure its efforts were not undercut. “When I set the rules, I have to make damn sure China can’t just buy the stuff from Japan or Korea or the Europeans,” she said.</p><p>The government also needed a “continuous dialogue” with the industry to figure out how to restrict technology that was incredibly complex, she said. “My thing is, you can’t put a price tag on national security. So if I dig into your profits, such is life.”</p><h3 id="link-3093d5cf"><span>Hidden Huawei Factories</span></h3><p>The <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-28270.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">export controls</a> issued last week ban certain chips and manufacturing equipment from being shipped to China, some on a global basis. They also <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-28267.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">add 140 Chinese companies</a> to the “entity list,” which prevents exporters from sending them certain technology without a special license. The three Chinese companies that bought billions of dollars of U.S. equipment — Swaysure Technology; Shenzhen Pengxinxu Technology, or PST; and Si’En Qingdao — were among those added to the list.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But <a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/bidens-final-export-control-salvo?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some analysts said</a> that the rules contained carve-outs that could undercut their power, and that they might come too late. According to a commercial market research report obtained by The New York Times, Swaysure, PST and Si’En Qingdao have finished building a dozen chip factories in China and may have already filled them with machinery.</p><p>While the rules will stop the most advanced chip-making equipment from being shipped anywhere in China, they do not impose additional restrictions on several major Chinese chipmakers or on some factories that, U.S. officials recently learned, are connected with Huawei.</p><p>One such plant, a multibillion-dollar state-owned chip factory in southern China, recently finished construction. According to corporate records from Wirescreen, a data platform, the factory does not share shareholders with Huawei or other companies on the entity list — and thus would not raise red flags for due diligence. But it sits on land owned by Huawei and is directly adjacent to another Huawei factory, public records show.</p><p>Two officials said that the U.S. government was aware of the information and that it was concerning that Huawei factories might still be receiving U.S. equipment. Huawei did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>Gregory C. Allen, a technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Chinese firms were finding ways around U.S. controls much more quickly than the U.S. was stopping them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The U.S. now has a track record of closing loopholes once per year, and China’s loophole identification operation runs 24/7/365,” Mr. Allen said.</p><h3 id="link-6a8c11be"><span>Loophole Identification</span></h3><p>In fact, those loopholes are what many officials believe allowed Huawei <a href="https://apnews.com/article/huawei-annual-report-sanctions-chips-dcc51751935f5d7b0fc34eeae03e2ca4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to survive</a>, despite being targeted by U.S. restrictions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html" title="">since 2019</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gina Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, speaks to reporters on the conclusion of her trip through China at Boeing’s Shanghai factory in August 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andy Wong/EPA-EFE, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In August of 2023, as Ms. Raimondo was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/31/business/economy/us-china-talks-gina-raimondo.html" title="">traveling through China</a>, Huawei surprised U.S. officials by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/business/economy/huawei-phone-us-china-raimondo.html" title="">releasing a phone</a> that contained a Chinese-made advanced chip.

In June, the United States threatened to deploy <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-is-fdpr-why-is-us-using-it-cripple-chinas-tech-sector-2022-10-07/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the foreign direct product rule</a>, which would effectively steamroll the other governments and impose global restrictions on their exports.</p><p>By September, the governments reached an agreement, which fell short of what some American officials had wanted, but constituted a significant expansion of global rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Estevez said that the United States was not afraid to act by itself, but that doing so would encourage global companies over time to remove American technology from their supply chains.
