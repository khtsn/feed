    <h1>Trump Names 2 New Top Financial Regulators</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>News of Mr. McKernan’s appointment came on the same evening that the consumer bureau fired many probationary employees, according to current employees and one person who was terminated.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who was involved in the bureau’s creation, said that regardless of who leads the agency, she was most concerned about whether Elon Musk and Mr. Trump would allow it to fulfill its mission as a consumer watchdog.</p><p>Mr. Musk, the billionaire who has led Mr. Trump’s efforts to cut government spending, has joked on his social media platform X about closing the consumer bureau. Mr. Vought, who assumed temporary leadership of the consumer bureau while also heading the Office of Management and Budget, has also called for the bureau to be abolished.</p><p>The firings at the bureau on Tuesday came despite an internal notice issued to agency leaders last month by Seth Frotman, then the bureau’s general counsel, citing legal grounds for retaining the probationary workers, many of whom are lawyers.</p><p>Some employees reported receiving dismissal letters that seemed hastily written. The heading “MEMORANDUM FOR [EmployeeFirstName] [EmployeeLastName], [JobTitle], [Division]” appeared on many notices.</p></div></div>
