    <h1>In Photos: An Earthquake Rocks Myanmar and Thailand</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A strong earthquake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, on Friday, damaging or collapsing bridges and buildings across a swath of Southeast Asia, killing nearly 150 people in Myanmar and injuring more than 700 others, according to Myanmar’s military government.</p><p>The 7.7-magnitude quake struck just before 1 p.m. local time, and a strong, 6.4-magnitude aftershock followed 11 minutes later. The shaking was felt in southern China and Vietnam and as far away as Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, where a 30-story skyscraper under construction collapsed, killing at least three people.</p><p>Details of casualties and damage in Myanmar, which has been ravaged by a four-year-long civil war, were not immediately clear. In Bangkok, people flooded into the streets out of fear of aftershocks, traffic was at a standstill, and videos captured water surging from the rooftop pools of hotels and residential towers.</p></div></div>
