Olson, a fellow at the Wilson Center’s Latin American program and Mexico Institute. “Usually there are more informal contacts and some level of discussion by now.”</p><p>The incoming administration may want to limit confrontation before ramping up pressure by signing a flurry of executive orders on migration, analysts say, leaving governments in the region scrambling to respond. That would likely strengthen Washington’s hand in upcoming negotiations.</p><p>“At the moment, we cannot talk about concrete measures because we have not had any specific conversations about immigration policies with the incoming authorities,” Santiago Palomo, the spokesman for Guatemala’s president, said in an interview about how his country is preparing to respond to Mr. Trump’s mass deportation plans.</p><p>Guatemala’s ambassador to the United States was in touch with the Trump transition team, officials said, but members of the incoming administration had not communicated specific plans around a ramp-up in deportations, or how Guatemala should prepare.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Honduran government officials also said they had not yet had significant contact with the incoming Trump administration. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/world/americas/honduras-trump-mass-deportations.html" title="">President Xiomara Castro of Honduras threatened</a> to push the U.S. military out of a base it built decades ago in the Central American country if Mr. Trump carries out mass deportations.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President-elect Donald Trump has made clear his focus on migration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Given Mr. Trump’s sharp focus on Latin America, the lack of clarity on his objectives has rattled regional governments.</p><p>The incoming administration has said that it wants to restore the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/us/politics/immigration-remain-mexico.html" title="">“Remain in Mexico”</a> policy implemented during the first Trump term, which forces some migrants to wait in Mexico rather than in the United States while their asylum cases are pending. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/trump-military-mass-deportation.html" title="">Mr. Trump has also said</a> he intends to declare a national emergency and use the U.S. military in some form to assist in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-2025-immigration-agenda.html" title="">plans for mass deportations</a> of millions of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>“President Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers and human traffickers in American history,” Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition team, wrote in an email to The New York Times. She did not respond to questions about whether the incoming administration has rebuffed Mexico’s and other countries’ requests for meetings.</p><p>Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said her administration does not approve of the mass deportation program. “Of course, we do not agree,” she said in a news conference on Wednesday. “But, in the event of such a decision by the U.S. government, we are prepared.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But whenever asked how the country will respond, her answers have been evasive — although <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/migration-mexico-honduras-panama-trump.html" title="">she recently signaled</a> the country’s willingness to accept some non-Mexican deportees.</p><p>“We are going to ask the United States that, as far as possible, the migrants who are not from Mexico can be sent to their countries of origin — and if not, we can collaborate through different mechanisms,” she told reporters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/migration-mexico-honduras-panama-trump.html" title="">earlier this month</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said her administration does not approve of the mass deportation program.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luis Antonio Rojas for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Some analysts said Mr. Trump’s team may be limiting their meetings with Latin American governments because they are worried about violating the Logan Act. That law forces incoming administrations to limit the scope of their negotiations with foreign governments until they take office, so as not to undermine sitting American presidents.</p><p>But previous incoming administrations have met with foreign governments to cautiously discuss their policy objectives, without violating the act.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Either way, the act has done little to curb Mr. Trump’s appetite to meet with his future counterparts. Since his November election, Mr. Trump has met separately with the leaders of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/europe/italy-donald-trump-meloni-visit.html" title="">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/canada/trudeau-trump-mar-a-lago-tariffs.html" title="">Canada</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/americas/argentina-president-milei-inflation-economy.html" title="">Argentina</a> at his hotel in Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>Despite the lack of contact, Mr. Trump has made his foreign policy objectives clear through speeches and on social media, giving the Mexican and other regional governments some insight into potential U.S. policies in the pipeline.</p><p>“Trump has signaled publicly that migration is a top priority, as are tariffs,” Mr. Olson said.</p><p>Shortly after his electoral victory, Mr. Trump threatened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/business/trump-tariffs-mexico-china.html" title="">slap 25 percent tariffs</a> on Mexico if it did not do more to curb migration and the flow of drugs.</p><p>“But there aren’t clear mechanisms for the Trump administration on how to engage in dialogue and negotiate. That will resolve soon enough” once he assumes office, Mr. Olson added.</p><p>The incoming U.S. administration will likely try to get Latin American countries to agree to accept asylum seekers from other nations that are seeking refuge in the U.S., known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/world/americas/guatemala-safe-third-asylum.html" title="">“safe third country agreements.”</a> The first Trump administration was able to get Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to sign those pacts, though the policy was only implemented in Guatemala, albeit fleetingly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guatemalans, deported from the United States, arriving in Guatemala City in 2020, during the first Trump administration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniele Volpe for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But those agreements may be tricker to forge this time. President Bernardo Arévalo of Guatemala told The Associated Press this week, “We are not a safe third country, nobody has proposed it.”</p><p>His foreign minister, Carlos Ramírez Martínez, said in an interview that he expected his government would face pressure. “I don’t doubt that that’s coming,” he said.</p><p>Officials in El Salvador have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY_NNbVR5ew" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that they will work with the Trump administration to protect the status of Salvadorans in the United States. “We are working so that migration can be an option not an obligation,” Cindy Portal, a senior foreign ministry official, said in a television interview on Wednesday.</p><p>Absent clarity from the transition team, some Latin American leaders are instead crafting a united response in anticipation of any executive orders related to immigration or deportations issued once Mr. Trump takes office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Representatives from several regional governments gathered in Mexico City this week to discuss the “opportunities and challenges of migration in the region and the strengthening of coordination and cooperation,” according to a Guatemalan government statement on the meeting.</p><p>The agenda, although heavy on migration, did not mention Mr. Trump.</p><p>Jody García contributed reporting from Guatemala City; Joan Suazo from Tegucigalpa, Honduras; and Gabriel Labrador from San Salvador, El Salvador.
