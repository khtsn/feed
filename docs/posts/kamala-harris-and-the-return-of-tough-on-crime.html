    <h1>Kamala Harris and the Return of ‘Tough on Crime’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>When Kamala Harris published her first book in 2009, recounting her experience as a California prosecutor, she called it “Smart on Crime.” That phrase would come to signal a kinder, gentler approach, but that is not how Ms. Harris meant it. She meant, the book’s marketing copy proclaimed, “making the criminal justice system truly — not just rhetorically — tough.”</p><p>By the time she ran for president in 2019, Ms. Harris was no longer talking tough. She called herself a progressive prosecutor and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kamala+gone+after+predators%2C+speech+to+staff&amp;sca_esv=fb4009a9e33de990&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWILXEBG5-AqqJ_EFiO_vuxdxwQDc7w%3A1723220478110&amp;ei=_kG2ZqapBqqdptQPl8fq-A4&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimoN7DqOiHAxWqjokEHZejGu8Q4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=kamala+gone+after+predators%2C+speech+to+staff&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiLGthbWFsYSBnb25lIGFmdGVyIHByZWRhdG9ycywgc3BlZWNoIHRvIHN0YWZmMgUQIRigATIFECEYqwIyBRAhGKsCSMsXUIIFWK8WcAJ4AJABAJgBa6ABjguqAQQxMi4zuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIPoALBC5gDAIgGAZIHAzguN6AH7D0&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed</a> to end the death penalty, mandatory minimum sentences and cash bail. The left was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html" title="">not buying it</a>: Progressives said her record was “<a href="https://theappeal.org/kamala-harris-criminal-justice-record-killed-her-presidential-run/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just slightly less awful</a>” than that of traditional prosecutors who measured their success by their conviction rates. The left wing of the Democratic Party helped push her out of the race.</p><p>Now she is back to being a Top Cop. Ms. Harris’s central pitch to voters has been her record as a prosecutor who has put away “predators, fraudsters and cheaters,” and could therefore handle her opponent in the presidential race. “So hear me when I say,” she tells crowds in her stump speech, “I know Donald Trump’s type.” It’s a refrain that voters are sure to hear repeated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week.</p><p>Ms. Harris’s repositioning could be read as opportunistic flip-flopping or, more charitably, as one person’s evolution. But it is also a mirror. Her move from tough to progressive closely tracked society’s changing views on crime and criminal justice, as it became clear that the war on drugs had failed to end the drug trade and ever-tougher sentences had left America with the world’s highest incarceration rate.</p></div></div><div><p>In 2009, when she published “Smart on Crime,” one in four Americans said they had “very little” confidence in the criminal justice system, according to Gallup. Ten years later, when she ran for president, it was more than one in three. And by that point, support for reform cut across party lines, with about two-thirds of Republicans agreeing that the system gave <a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/25-years-1994-crime-bill-voters-back-criminal-justice-reforms/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unfair advantages to the rich</a> and 40 percent favoring the <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-55-americans-favor-decriminalizing-drugs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decriminalization of drugs</a>.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24nat-justice-ideas-02-fpgl/24nat-justice-ideas-02-fpgl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24nat-justice-ideas-02-fpgl/24nat-justice-ideas-02-fpgl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/24/multimedia/24nat-justice-ideas-02-fpgl/24nat-justice-ideas-02-fpgl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Kamala Harris speaking at a podium, with her right hand slightly raised.

The killing of George Floyd by police officers in May 2020 touched off global protests against police brutality and racism, but also filled screens with images of Molotov cocktails and burning police precincts. The pandemic touched off a surge in murder and other violent crime. Finally, for the first time, a former president was criminally convicted, bringing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/podcasts/im-just-really-glad-that-trumps-ok.html" title="">many of his supporters</a> around to the view that the system is rigged — but not for the reasons that reform advocates would have liked.</p><p>The about-faces came so quickly that they left even someone like me, a reporter who has covered criminal justice for more than two decades, baffled about what Americans really believe. And then into this confusion strode the surprise candidate, Ms. Harris, embracing her identity as a prosecutor in a way that would have been unimaginable four years ago. Of course, she is responding to a unique context, presenting a direct contrast to an opponent who stands convicted of 34 felonies. Her self-portrayal may also help her undercut what voters perceive as a Republican advantage on the issue of crime, at a moment of heightened concern about it.</p><p>But given her track record as a gauge of public opinion, should we see the new Kamala Harris as a sign that Americans are fully returning to the politics of “tough on crime”?</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-26c3f96">From ‘Superpredators’ to ‘The New Jim Crow’</h2><p>It is worth taking a step back to recount why there was a movement for reform in the first place. In the 1990s, crack cocaine and hysteria over youthful “superpredators” drove the passage of mandatory minimums and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/booming/born-of-grief-three-strikes-laws-are-being-rethought.html" title="">“three strikes” laws</a>. At the same time, DNA provided the first proof that the system was catching innocent people in its net. The videotaped beating of Rodney King in 1992 led to the creation of federal police oversight powers.</p><p>Over the following decades, one damning finding after another came to light: The system was rife with racial disparities from traffic stops to death row. Prisoners were regularly raped, mistreated and denied medical care. The police beat and killed people with impunity. And rather than focus on the few greatest threats to social order, the system expanded to touch the lives of millions. In January 2008, <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2008/02/28/one-in-100-behind-bars-in-america-2008" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Pew study found</a>, one in 100 Americans was behind bars. Far more were on probation or parole, or saddled with a criminal record.</p><p>High-profile tragedies would help galvanize a movement. The Black Lives Matter protests following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 exposed both the heavy militarization of departments across the country, and the systematic siphoning of fines, fees and bail money from the communities who could least afford them.</p><p>For all the billions of dollars invested in this system, it had a poor track record of making society safer. More than <a href="https://counciloncj.org/recidivism-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a third of prisoners are back behind bars</a> within three years of their release. Putting people in jail, one <a href="https://craftmediabucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/HiddenCosts.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oft-cited study</a> showed, made them more likely to commit crimes in the future — not less. There was a growing body of evidence that alternatives like drug treatment instead of jail for people with addictions were better, more efficient and more humane ways to alleviate crime. Books like “The New Jim Crow,” published in 2010, and “Just Mercy,” published in 2014, became best sellers, increasing the popular understanding of the racist elements of the system and helping to build the movement that was peaking when Ms. Harris first sought the presidential nomination.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police fired tear gas on protesters in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Whitney Curtis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Reform had become a truly bipartisan issue, appealing not just to liberals but also to Christian conservatives who believed in second chances, fiscal conservatives who recognized the unsustainable costs of incarceration and libertarians who saw government overreach in many aspects of the system. Deep red states like Texas and Georgia passed reform packages to shrink the footprints of their criminal justice systems. New laws raised the minimum age for charging juveniles as adults and allowed old convictions that kept people from finding housing and jobs to be expunged. Prosecutors began to demonstrate that — sometimes — the police could be held criminally accountable for misconduct and violence.</p></div><div><div><p>Many of the most heralded changes were watered down and incremental. Still, they happened. President Trump signed — and <a href="http://nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/politics/first-step-act-donald-trump.html" title="">boasted about signing</a> — the First Step Act, the first significant piece of federal reform legislation in decades. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/politics/trump-alice-johnson-pardon.html" title="">pardoned Alice Johnson</a>, a first-time, nonviolent drug offender serving a life sentence.</p><p>And of course, much of the change was possible only because crime continued to trend downward. In New York City in 2001, a columnist wrote that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/nyregion/new-york-murder-rate-falls-again-but-has-it-hit-bottom.html" title="">if homicides clocked in below 600</a> in a single year it would be worth a ticker-tape parade. Last year, they were under 400.</p><p>Mr. Floyd’s killing brought such universal outrage that for a brief time in 2020, even more sweeping measures seemed possible. Republicans and Democrats alike condemned the actions of the police, and departments across the country acknowledged the need to win public trust. Again, there was common ground: Neither the public nor the police thought officers should remain the first line of response to problems like homelessness and mental illness.</p><p>But the backlash was swift, as conservatives quickly sought to blame disorder and looting on Democratic mayors, with a message amplified by moneyed interests like the bail industry and private prisons. Gun homicides spiked by 26 percent in a single year, reaching record highs in some cities and contributing to a sense that things were out of control. A housing crisis only exacerbated the problem, contributing to serious quality-of-life problems brought on by encampments and open-air drug use.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Commentators began to write <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/george-floyd-anniversary-police-reform-violent-crime/630174/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obituaries</a> for criminal justice reform, bolstered by highly visible defeats: Calls to defund the police proved so unpopular that they helped Republicans at the polls. Congress failed to act on the George Floyd Justice in Policing bill. Chesa Boudin, the progressive prosecutor in San Francisco who promised to eliminate cash bail and reduce incarceration, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/us/politics/chesa-boudin-recall-san-francisco.html" title="">ousted in a recall</a>. Oregon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/us/oregon-drug-decriminalization-rollback-measure-110.html" title="">thought better</a> of its decriminalization of hard drugs. Louisiana and Maryland rolled back hard-fought changes to juvenile justice, allowing younger children to be tried as adults. Politicians turned once again to blasting one another for being soft on crime.</p><h2 id="link-645c307b">The ‘pragmatic prosecutor’</h2><p>Even Republicans appear confused by Ms. Harris’s repositioning. Her opponents are simultaneously attacking her from the right for being “<a href="https://x.com/TheStevenCheung/status/1816148262908293360" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soft as Charmin</a>” on crime, and from the left for having used her power to <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1816165200988442725.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lock up Black men</a> for smoking pot.</p><p>But if she continues to be a mirror of society’s views, what she has done so far is revealing: She is no longer calling herself a progressive prosecutor. Now, she is a “pragmatic prosecutor.” It suggests less an ideological approach to change than a deference to what works. And the reality is that reformers have made too many real gains for them all to come undone. Voters, for the most part, aren’t eager to return to the harsh laws of the ’90s. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Only 9 percent</a> think the system is “very fair,” and roughly two-thirds believe spending on drug addiction, homelessness and mental health will reduce crime more than spending on law enforcement.</p><p>Curious how criminal justice reformers felt about this moment, I called various people who have worked on the issue. Some were depressed over the rollback of changes that would be devastating for real people, like teenagers accused of crimes in Louisiana who could now be charged as adults — something the evidence suggests is a bad idea. Others shrugged, calling the changes a course correction for reforms that overshot the mark, or saying that a backlash was only proof that something was working. Still others insisted that the bipartisan will for reform was still intact, pointing to the recent, near-unanimous passage of the Federal Prison Oversight Act, which provides for the independent investigation of complaints after Congress found widespread sexual abuse and other criminal misconduct.</p><p>“It’s certainly not as bipartisan as it used to be,” acknowledged Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster who has worked on criminal justice issues. “Now, that being said, when you test in individual states, which I’ve done over the last year, on certain things that people want to try to get done, there is still bipartisan support.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris departed a rally at Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nev., this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bridget Bennett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Policies like providing drug and mental health treatment instead of jail remain popular with coveted swing voters like suburban women, who appreciate it when politicians show they can reach across the aisle. “Republicans have got to have a narrative with women, post-Dobbs,” said Holly Harris, a Republican and longtime advocate for reform, referring to the Supreme Court decision that took away the right to an abortion. “Criminal justice reform is one of those places where you can show compassion, but also an incredible public safety return.”</p><p>Much has changed across the country. Many police departments have banned choke holds, no-knock warrants and high-speed chases, and more of their interactions are captured by body cameras. Marijuana is legal in roughly half the states. Mental health calls to 911 are more likely to be answered by mental health professionals. Despite some high-profile defeats, progressive prosecutors continue to win elections.</p><p>Despite the “whiplash” of the past few years, said Adam Gelb, the president and chief executive of the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank for criminal justice policy, “There is very little chance that we’ll return fully to the notion that we can arrest and punish our way to safety.”</p><p>As I puzzled through all of this, I realized that I had not asked the most obvious question: After all this effort, for all these years, how had our criminal justice system changed by some of the most fundamental measures? I looked it up: From its peak in 2008 to 2022, the country’s incarceration rate fell by 27 percent — all while crime rates stayed low. And sometime around 2020, according to the advocacy group the Sentencing Project, the United States dropped out of the global first-place slot it held for decades. Sure, the countries that outpace us — El Salvador, Rwanda and Cuba — are hardly bastions of human rights. But for the first time in decades, we are no longer No. 1.</p></div></div><div><div><p>What’s more, the Council on Criminal Justice has found that the race gap is shrinking — from 2000 to 2020, the <a href="https://counciloncj.foleon.com/reports/racial-disparities/national-trends" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disparity between Black and white adults in state prisons fell</a> to 5-to-1 from 8-to-1, and for drug offenses, it shrank even more.</p><p>Taken together, these two measures are headline news that failed to make the headlines. And they may tell us more about the fate of criminal justice reform than what Kamala Harris calls herself.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shaila Dewan covers criminal justice — policing, courts and prisons — across the country.
