I think for the most part, it’s been positive. And I still feel that I’ve made the right decision voting for Trump. As mayor of my small city here in Roma, Texas, I am concerned about the tariffs. We’ve recently developed a 300-plus-acre industrial park development for imports. The import of produce and other commodities. So we are concerned about how that’s going to affect our development. And we’ve gotten several investors to come in and look at our, this development wanting to invest. But some of them have actually told us, we’re very interested in developing in your city, however, because of the tariffs, we’re going to take a pause and see how things play out the next two, three, four months.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/21/us/politics/Jaime-Escobar/Jaime-Escobar-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As mayor of the small border town of Roma, Jaime Escobar Jr. was accustomed to assessing whether strategies were working. At this point, Mr. Escobar remained mostly optimistic, but he was still wary.</p><p>“I’m not saying I’m 100 percent happy with everything, but for the most part, I feel that Trump is tackling the issues that the American voters thought were important,” he said, referring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-immigration-policies-deportations-data.html" title="">immigration</a> and the economy. “I don’t regret voting for him.”</p><p>He identified as a Democrat until the migrant crisis and, after years of what he described as chaos at the border, he voted for Mr. Trump, a Republican. Mr. Escobar appreciated that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-border-asylum-explainer.html" title="">several early executive orders</a> effectively barred migrants from entering the nation and applying for asylum. He said he felt that the actions stood in sharp contrast to how President Joseph R. Biden Jr. often spoke <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/biden-immigration-border-harris-trump.html" title="">about addressing immigration reform</a> through a bipartisan congressional effort.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html" title="">The evolution of Mr. Trump’s tariff policies</a> became a cause for concern for Mr. Escobar, even beyond stock market turmoil and fears of inflation. But the mayor said he recently noticed lower prices at local grocery stores and gas pumps. Mr. Escobar — who expanded from relying on CNN for national news to including The Times, Fox News and MSNBC — said he remained confident that Mr. Trump had a long-term economic plan.</p><p>“I think there’s a strategy that Trump and his administration is trying to put into place,” Mr. Escobar added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The biggest downside in his view?

No, I don’t have any regrets. My Jill Stein vote personally was not necessarily directly for her. Mine was more of a protest vote. I just felt as a country, we should have put a stop to the war, you know, between the Palestinians and the Israelis. Actions I’ve been supportive of is trying to stop the war in Ukraine. I see some of the angles he’s coming from in terms of tariffs, but I don’t like the side of it where we are alienating a lot of our United States allies. I’m in sales myself, so to me, I’m always going to be in favor of negotiations. I think he’s taken kind of, almost like they would say in sales, a hard sell angle of negotiations where it’s going to be like my way or the highway. This is the way I want things done, and that’s the way it’s going to be.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/22/us/politics/Dave-Abdullah_v2/Dave-Abdullah_v2-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Dave Abdallah always admired Mr. Trump’s tendency to say what was on his mind.</p><p>But to Mr. Adballah, a real estate agent, there was a line that could be crossed — one Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-administration-missteps.html" title="">zoomed past too often</a>.</p><p>“He’s taking it a bit too far,” Mr. Adballah said.</p><p>Change can be good, he added — if implemented thoughtfully.

Those that he has chosen to deport, they still deserved due process, not rounded up, snatched away from their families. He had a playbook. A lot of us voters didn’t pay attention. Knowing that this is who we have for the next four years, I’m really trying to remain hopeful that he will at some point focus on what’s best for all Americans, and not just his base.

Here we go. I mean, it’s just been totally unpredictable. I voted Republican, I voted for Trump because I wanted change. I don’t know that I made the right decision or the wrong decision. I made the one that I had the highest hopes for. There are things that I like about what he’s doing, and that he’s willing to make changes, and he’s willing to charge in there and say, “No, this is wrong. We got to fix it.” There are things that I don’t like because in the process of your bull in the china shop attitude, Mr. Trump, you are trampling all over people’s lives. I think the DOGE cuts to an extent needed to be done. But DOGE just kind of went at it with the bulldozer effect, and with no care or concern for the fallout. The tariffs do affect the flower shop a lot because all of our flowers are imported. Yes, we have the increased cost on the glass with the tariffs, but the increased cost of everything affects my customer base because I’m not a necessity business.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/29/29vid-trump-100-Darlene-Alfieri-28384-cover/29vid-trump-100-Darlene-Alfieri-28384-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Darlene Alfieri, a registered Democrat and owner of a flower shop, felt things had gotten so off track that it was worth the risk of voting for Mr. Trump — he had promised a major break with the status quo, after all.</p><p>“I think it’s kind of a roller coaster,” she said. Tariffs bumped up her operating costs, and she knew people affected by cuts to the federal government. The problems Mr. Trump pledged to fix were not created in a matter of weeks, she said, and they would not be fixed that quickly.</p><p>“I feel like they’re at least taking a different approach,” she said, adding, “I’m just not sure it’ll work.”</p><p>She remains frustrated over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/trump-tariffs-trade-deals.html" title="">a lack of details</a>: How long should people expect higher prices from tariffs?

Businessman Hamid, an immigrant from Pakistan. I love his policies. I love what he’s doing so far. The tariffs. Yes, hey, people were taking advantage of us, that they were, corrections were needed. Corrections were needed in the market, everything. Even though businesses slow down a little bit, since when he first took over. But that’s understandable, sometimes you have to take a step back when you want to move forward. But father of two Muslim children is unhappy or worried. More like worried with all the rhetoric.

I’m a rare teacher that supports getting rid of the Department of Education. I mean, I do have some students that are concerned about some things. They’re friends with illegal immigrants, and they’re afraid that their friends may be deported.
