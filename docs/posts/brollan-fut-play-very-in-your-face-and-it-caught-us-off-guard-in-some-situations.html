                  <p>&#34;They have a different style compared to others, they play very in your face and I think it caught us off-guard in some situations.&#34;</p>

                  <p>The Swede conceded that the map pool change has made the match-up even harder. &#34;They have a really good Dust2 and we permabanned it before,&#34; he said. &#34;Mainly, we need to find a pick versus them. We picked between Inferno and Nuke in these two series, and it didn&#39;t work out.&#34;</p>

                  <p><strong>People have given FUT high praise for their individuals, and you seemed to be able to limit them on Mirage, but then Overpass was quite a different story and you had to pull off a big comeback on the CT side. Can you talk me through the match and how difficult it was on Overpass?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, of course they are very... they want to do something every round, and they want to move all the time. Krabeni is their A player and he wants to do a lot of things, and he controls it very well. It&#39;s just that they have a different style compared to others, they play very in your face and I think it caught us off-guard in some situations, especially our T side.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>We need to find a pick versus Vitality</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>Tell me about making the comeback on the CT side and pulling through in overtime. Did it feel like maybe that inexperience got to them as you were making it closer?</strong></p>
                  <p>I mean, it could be, it could be inexperience from them, but I think it&#39;s hard to play T side overall, especially on Overpass. I felt like we were in control pretty much all the time. There was one clutch from xertioN, which was very important.</p>
                  <p>We of course prepped the map and we know how they&#39;re playing, and they played pretty much the same as we felt they were going to, so we were really confident and we basically knew what they were doing pretty much all the time.</p>
                  <p><strong>It was a confident run through the group stage outside of the Vitality series. Last year, you figured out how to make it competitive against them and even grabbed a couple of wins off of them. This year, it has turned very much the other way in the last couple of series. What&#39;s been going wrong?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think they have a lot of momentum, of course. In the second season, I think they were maybe not in their best shape. The map pool has been a factor. They have a really good Dust2 and we permabanned it before, and we just need to get more experience on it, as well. I feel like everyone on the team maybe forgot how to play it a little bit, but we just need the experience and more praccs on it, especially myself as a caller.</p>
                  <p>Mainly, we need to find a pick versus them. We picked between Inferno and Nuke in these two series, and it didn&#39;t work out. We just need to find a consistent pick and I think that&#39;s it, and try to improve our Dust2 more, because they are 40-4 on it or something last year.</p>

                  <p><strong>Train was a big map for you in general. How much do you think it has affected your overall map pool, not necessarily just facing Vitality, heading into this year?</strong></p>
                  <p>To be honest, it affected us quite a bit. It was statistically our best map. We just need to find more consistency on some other maps, and I think our Mirage is getting there. We just need to play it more. The same goes with the other maps, to be honest. We need to practice a bit more as well, what we feel in the right situations and how we want to play on some maps.</p>
                  <p>Inferno is our main pick at the moment, and it can be a problem against the better teams because it&#39;s very competitive on that map especially. Besides top 10, you can easily see you can punish the lower teams, especially on Inferno, and I think it&#39;s more comfortable. We just need to find a better pick for the better teams. Inferno versus Falcons of course is good, but...</p>

                    <p>There&#39;s a lot of frustration when you&#39;re losing a lot of playoff matches versus the big teams</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>In terms of deciding between Dust2 and Anubis at the turn of the year. Was there ever a chance you&#39;d pick up Anubis, or was it always gonna be Dust2, which you played in the first half of 2025?</strong></p>
                  <p>I mean, it was no question for us. We just needed to play Dust2 again. We were very behind on Anubis and four of us never played it a single time on HLTV, so it was kind of obvious for us.</p>
                  <p><strong>Heading into the playoffs, there&#39;s always the question about what you guys are missing from finally clinching a trophy ever since you did it a year ago here. How do you see your chances of breaking through that barrier this time?</strong></p>
                  <p>Compared to Krakow, we had a lot of talks coming into this tournament. We&#39;re really honest to each other and see what the frustrations were, because there&#39;s a lot of frustration when you&#39;re losing a lot of playoff matches versus the big teams.</p>
                  <p>We just need to talk about it more, which helps us a lot, to be honest, especially for this tournament and for the first two games. We just need to show up when we need to. Vitality is of course on another level than other teams at the moment. If we play them, we just need to show up as a team and destroy them individually, but I think that&#39;s it.</p>
                  <p><strong>It&#39;s tough.</strong></p>
                  <p>Yeah, of course.</p>
