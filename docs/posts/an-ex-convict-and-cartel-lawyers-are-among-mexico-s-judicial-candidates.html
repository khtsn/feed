Another was embroiled in a scandal involving journalists shot dead. At least four have faced investigations for offenses like sexual abuse or organized crime.</p><p>These are just a few of the candidates vying for judgeships and magistrate posts in Mexico’s first-ever judicial elections on Sunday, which are set to transform the nation’s judiciary, including the Supreme Court.</p><p>The overhaul has opened the door to more than 7,000 candidates, shifting the judiciary from an appointment-based system to one where voters elect judges and there are few requirements to run.</p><p>The changes were pushed last year by the former president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and backed by his successor, Claudia Sheinbaum. They have argued the measure would infuse the judicial branch with more independence, root out corruption and, by allowing citizens to select judges, democratize the judiciary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But some critics and legal experts said the move could instead erode judicial independence and expand the sway of the governing Morena party. They say that the election to fill 2,681 judicial posts risks turning the courts into a politicized body defined by popularity, not legal expertise, and more vulnerable to outside influence.</p><p>Criminal groups have already infiltrated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/americas/mexico-election-candidates-killed.html" title="">local governments</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-police-arrested-corruption-abuses-cartels-ddd782952811a05c0355d058b3dcb7ee" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">security forces</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/world/americas/mexico-cartels-michoacan.html" title="">sectors of the economy</a> in large parts of Mexico. That candidates accused of criminal ties will appear on the ballot has fueled further fears that organized crime has found ways of “ensuring that its tentacles will reach into the judicial system,” said Amrit Singh, a professor at Stanford Law School who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/opinion/mexico-judges-election-government.html" title="">analyzed</a> Mexico’s experiment.</p><p>“It’s very easy to imagine a situation where organized crime would get to influence the elections, directly or indirectly, and the votes that a judge receives.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico in Mexico City, on Wednesday.

But from our perspective it is better to do it this way than what we had before, or what we still have today, where there is nepotism and corruption,” she said last month. “We’re talking about a tiny, minuscule percentage of all the candidates who went through the vetting process.”</p><p>Even members of Ms. Sheinbaum’s party have tried to block some candidates, however.</p><p>“We missed some cases,” Gerardo Fernández Noroña, the president of the Mexican Senate and a Morena member, told reporters in April. “They should not participate. They do not comply with the constitutional requirement of probity.”</p><p>Under the old system, to be appointed a judge, a candidate needed to be internally promoted based on exams, training and performance evaluations. The rules were meant to ensure qualified candidates, but they did not prevent problems like corruption.</p><p>To get on the ballot for Sunday’s election, people needed to meet a few basic requirements — a law degree, some professional experience and a clean criminal record. They were then evaluated by selection committees, groups of experts assembled by each branch of government and tasked with identifying the most qualified candidates.</p><p>It is unclear how some people who did not appear to meet the criteria made it onto the ballot, and supporters of the election have acknowledged that tainted candidates slipped through.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In letters seen by The New York Times, the presidents of both houses of Congress — where Morena holds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/world/americas/mexico-judical-overhaul-senate-vote.html" title="">supermajorities</a> — asked the country’s electoral authority to exclude 18 candidates they said did not meet the constitutional requirement of having a “good reputation.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gerardo Fernandez Norona, president of the Senate and Morena member, in Mexico City in 2024. “We missed some cases,” he told reporters in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Henry Romero/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The attorney general’s office has investigated at least four of the candidates for crimes such as sexual abuse or organized crime, according to the letters, which were sent in early May. Two more had worked as defense lawyers for cartel members. The rest were suspected of involvement with criminal groups or having favored them in some way.</p><p>“Failure to cancel the registrations of such candidacies would seriously compromise the jurisdictional function,” the letters said. But under the new regulations, the National Electoral Institute, the agency that organizes elections and oversees voting, can only review and disqualify candidates after Election Day.</p><p>The institute will evaluate the profiles of the candidate who receives the most votes in each contest. Factors like having a criminal record, being a registered sex offender, being wanted for a crime or having a history of domestic violence could disqualify some candidates, potentially leading to their removal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Of course we are appalled by the fact that someone defended drug traffickers,” said Norma Irene de la Cruz Magaña, a member of the institute’s governing council. “Is that enough to disqualify them? I don’t know.”</p><p>Fernando Escamilla, a 32-year-old candidate for state criminal judge in the northern state of Nuevo León, once offered legal services to Miguel Ángel Treviño, a notoriously brutal leader of the Zetas cartel, and Eleazar Medina-Rojas, another high-ranking member of the same cartel.</p><p>Mr. Escamilla has acknowledged working for Mr. Medina-Rojas. But he said in an interview that in the case of Mr. Treviño, who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/world/americas/capture-of-mexican-crime-boss-appears-to-end-a-brutal-chapter.html" title="">captured</a> in Mexico in 2013 and is believed to be responsible for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/world/americas/26mexico.html" title="">killings</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/world/americas/09mexico.html" title="">of scores of people</a>, he merely provided legal advice on extradition laws to the defense team.</p><p>Disqualifying him for this reason, Mr. Escamilla said, would be “unfair” and “discriminatory to the free exercise of the legal profession,” adding that all Mexican citizens have the right to an adequate legal defense.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Posters displaying candidate and election information in front of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation in Mexico City, on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false"> Stephania Corpi/Bloomberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“It’s like a doctor,” he said. “When patients arrive at the emergency room, the doctor doesn’t ask what they do for a living before deciding whether to treat them, they just do.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Francisco Herrera Franco, a former prosecutor in Michoacán State, resigned from that job after a recording surfaced in which he seemed to advise a man, accused of being a cartel leader, on how to manipulate a murder investigation. He has <a href="https://wradio.com.mx/2025/04/08/fiscal-del-terror-niega-acusaciones-en-su-contra-y-pide-a-organizaciones-platicar-para-aclarar-hechos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> that the voice in the recording was his, and he faces no criminal charges.</p><p>He was also enmeshed in the case of two journalists who had reported on corruption allegations against him, and were later found shot dead. One of those journalists had filed a complaint against Mr. Herrera Franco and other state officials, saying he had received death threats and that he feared for his life, according to official documents. Mr. Herrera Franco has denied any involvement in the cases.</p><p>Now Mr. Herrera Franco is running for a criminal court judgeship in Michoacán.</p><p>Unlike in the United States, where lawyers must follow strict codes of conduct or face disbarment, Mexico’s bar associations have little oversight over their members. While many lawyers representing people with criminal ties operate within legal bounds, others serve as key intermediaries between cartels and business leaders or corrupt officials, and even help coordinate illegal operations.</p><p>Other candidates are controversial for reasons unrelated to advising cartels.</p><p>In 2015, Leopoldo Javier Chávez Vargas was arrested in Laredo, Texas, for trying to smuggle nearly nine pounds of methamphetamine into the United States and served nearly six years in federal prison. He is now running for a federal judgeship in Durango State.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In an interview, Mr. Chávez Vargas said his story is one “of transformation, not repetition.”</p><p>“I don’t deny my past,” he said, adding that his experience gives him “a deeper understanding” of the system’s failures and the effect it has on people. “I have fully accepted the consequences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People protesting the judicial overhaul in Mexico City in 2024.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Marian Carrasquero for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Jesús Humberto Padilla Briones, who is seeking election as a criminal court judge in Nuevo León, was arrested in 2023 on charges of trafficking 15 bags of meth and illegally carrying a weapon, according to court documents. He was later released on probation, and did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The issue in many of these cases, experts and rights advocates say, comes down to <a href="https://eljuegodelacorte.nexos.com.mx/the-judicial-election-in-mexico-do-the-people-really-decide/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hastily designed</a> and inadequate screening methods.</p><p>“It seems like they didn’t even Google some of these candidates,” said Miguel Alfonso Meza, an anti-corruption activist and director of Defensorxs, a Mexican watchdog group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Screening officials have defended their work, saying they requested criminal records and background checks for candidates.</p><p>“We were exhaustive in gathering all this information,” said Andrés García Repper, who participated in an evaluation committee and is now a candidate in Tamaulipas State. “If two cases out of more than 12,000 seep through, well, that speaks to the effectiveness of the committee’s work.”</p><p>Mr. García Repper’s committee approved the candidacies of at least four men accused of serious crimes, including Mr. Chávez Vargas and Mr. Padilla Briones.</p><p>“The problem lies not in the facts that we know about these problematic candidates,” said Alberto Zinser, one of Mexico’s most prominent criminal defense lawyers. “It is what we don’t know about the thousands of candidates we will be voting for.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p></div></div></div></article></div>
