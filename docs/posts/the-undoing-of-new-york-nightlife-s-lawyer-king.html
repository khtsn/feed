Four months later, he was hit with a second set of charges and a score of lawsuits, legal filings that accused him of bilking his clients of millions of dollars.</p><p>In August, it all came to an end.</p><p>Mr. Strazzullo, 52, was found dead in a black Fiat convertible behind his parents’ home in Bath Beach, Brooklyn, just days before he was due back in court. The death appeared to be a suicide, a law enforcement official said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Strazzullo’s rise was enabled by a city awash with music, models, nightclubs and the shimmering wealth that has beckoned strivers for centuries. But in New York, fame and success are fickle companions: The city also provided all the conditions necessary for his fall.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Strazzullo found his services in demand among a specific clientele: models in trouble.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Strazzullo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/nyregion/salvatore-strazzullo-night-life-lawyer.html" title="">projected an image of success</a>, driving luxury cars, scoring the ritziest reservations and surveying his spoils from a Battery Park City penthouse. But criminal filings, civil complaints and interviews with friends and colleagues paint a picture of a man in dire straits, trying to outrun years of unpaid bills, corrupt deals and theft.</p><p>“Sal was always about image,” said R. Couri Hay, a publicist and former gossip columnist who knew Mr. Strazzullo for almost 30 years. “He wanted to be that fast-paced nightlife lawyer with the tables and the girls and the Rolexes.</p><p>“Trying to keep up with the Rockefellers, you know, can be hard,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-2c1239aa">Law Books in the Nightclub</h2><p>Mr. Strazzullo grew up in Bensonhurst and nursed dreams of making it big over the bridge in Manhattan. In the early 1990s, he started as a promoter at a Times Square nightclub while studying at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, poring over law books in the back room of the pulsing club.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Strazzullo took a brief foray into ownership — he opened a nightclub called Gravity in Bay Ridge — but eventually turned his attention to his studies, graduating from New York Law School’s night program.</p><p>When he passed the bar in 2002, Mr. Strazzullo set up shop in the empty room of a real estate office on 18th Avenue in Brooklyn and filled his weeks with local matters like drunken-driving charges and a dispute between neighbors over a fig tree.</p><p>Then, in 2008, Mr. Strazzullo landed his name-making case. His client, Milana Dravnel, a Russian stripper, held a news conference to say she had photos of the boxer Oscar De La Hoya taken during a hotel rendezvous that showed Mr. De La Hoya posing in fishnets and a tutu.</p><p>The photos found their way online, and after Ms. Dravnel and Mr. De La Hoya feuded bitterly about whether they had been altered, she sued him on claims of fraud, defamation and emotional distress. The case was eventually settled out of court, but Mr. Strazzullo made tabloid headlines, appearing outside the Manhattan federal courthouse, arms linked with Ms. Dravnel, dress shoes matching his camel-hair topcoat.</p><p>The cases kept coming, each enmeshing him deeper into the glittering world of New York’s night crawlers and minor celebrities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>There was Foxy Brown, a rapper for whom Mr. Strazzullo devised an “<a href="https://nypost.com/2011/07/13/over-the-moon-3/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">underwear defense</a>” after she was accused of mooning a neighbor — he argued that she hadn’t exposed her hindquarters on purpose, because she hadn’t been wearing underwear in the first place. The charge was dismissed. There was Ingrid Gutierrez, a model who was smacked by a bottle in a fight between the R&amp;B singer Chris Brown and the rapper Drake over Rihanna.</p><p>Mr. Strazzullo rubbed shoulders with designer-clad women at charity galas and Hamptons bashes and, once, with former Mayor Bill de Blasio. He dined at the city’s most extravagant restaurants, and by 2018, was renting a penthouse in Battery Park City for $12,000 a month.</p><p>After a failed marriage to Jodie Fanelli, a model, Mr. Strazzullo married Alison Cronin, a former Miss Massachusetts, and started a family.</p><p>Even as Mr. Strazzullo made his name in Manhattan — he set up offices on lower Park Avenue and later, TriBeCa — he remained faithful to his Brooklyn roots, sharing his good fortune with the community that made him.</p><p>“He was always the type of guy that, if anyone needed anything, people would call on him,” said Manni Scarso, a friend from childhood, who described Mr. Strazzullo as a devoted father to his three children, and especially his son, Emilio, who was born with a heart condition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In photos from an October 2020 event at his sleek gray law office, Mr. Strazzullo can be seen holding a giant check made out to the Weill Cornell Children’s Health Council.</p><p>His flagship office in Bensonhurst become a community hub. At Christmas, the office would distribute board games and toys to children <a href="https://brooklynreporter.com/2017/12/strazzullo-law-firm-celebrates-at-annual-tree-lighting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">during an annual tree lighting</a>, with Mr. Strazzullo standing beneath a hulking 30-foot fir, his coat matching his black leather gloves.</p><p>“He was a fixture in the community,” Mr. Scarso said. “He was always around.”</p><h2 id="link-63659602">Spending Stolen Money</h2><p>Mr. Strazzullo presented a vision of success. But the custom suits and luxury cars, prosecutors said in an indictment, were a facade propped up by years of fraud.</p><p>Mr. Strazzullo stole millions of dollars from clients in his own neighborhood, according to two recent indictments and a flurry of lawsuits that followed. He would keep a portion of proceeds from home sales and estate proceedings he worked on, prosecutors say, making excuses — or disappearing entirely — when his clients came looking for their money.</p><p>In 2016, he tricked a client into lending almost $800,000 to a company that he secretly owned, according to one complaint.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>By June 2021, prosecutors say, he was running a Ponzi scheme out of his escrow account, using stolen funds to repay previous debts. That month, he stole $693,273 from a 54-year-old man and 52-year-old woman whose family properties he had helped sell, prosecutors said. The next April, he pocketed $933,120 from a 90-year-old man and an 88-year-old woman he represented, they said.</p><p>“He wasn’t just stealing from people he didn’t know,” said Cheryl Gilroy, a former client and friend who had asked Mr. Strazzullo to represent her in estate proceedings after her husband, Gary, died suddenly in August 2021. An indictment said Mr. Strazzullo shorted her $96,000.</p><p>Still, he continued to live in style. He spent lavishly on steakhouse dinners and hotel stays. Mr. Hay, the publicist, recalled meeting Mr. Strazzullo for a drink two years ago at Casa Cipriani, a five-star hotel, and learning that Mr. Strazzullo had been living there.</p><p>“He felt that all these trappings were who he was,” Mr. Hay said.</p><p>Early in the pandemic, Mr. Strazzullo’s wife, Alison, appeared in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/fashion/weddings/how-covid-has-altered-the-conversation-about-money.html" title="">New York Times</a> personal finance column to talk about how their family handled money.</p><p>“Sal has always made all the decisions for our family,” Ms. Strazzullo said. “Because of the uncertainty of Covid-19 and what it can do to people, we both knew we needed to know everything about each others’ finances.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Mr. Strazzullo’s secret life was coming into view.</p><p>In July 2020, Mr. Strazzullo defaulted on nine consecutive months of rent at his apartment, according to a lawsuit from his landlord. In the two years that followed, he ceased payments on one of his law offices, failed to pay his taxes and abruptly broke the lease on a home his family was renting in coastal Massachusetts, leaving behind dented walls and wine and urine-stained linens in his wake, according to <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/111923679/original-civil-complaint-filed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">court records</a>.</p><p>Altogether, he owed at least $553,241.</p><p>By 2023, things had worsened. In September, his wife filed for divorce. Two months later, Mr. Strazzullo moved out of his Battery Park City apartment, leaving $35,000 in damages and $53,500 in unpaid rent, filings show.</p><h2 id="link-c1b2d09">‘A Complete Shock’</h2><p>The first indictment landed in the winter of 2023, and the unraveling followed quickly.</p><p>In December, Mr. Strazzullo sat in Brooklyn Criminal Court, charged with grand larceny and scheme to defraud. By April, the Brooklyn district attorney had announced a second indictment, expanding the charges.</p><p>Rumors swirled around Brooklyn. Some had heard Mr. Strazzullo had fled to Italy. Others wondered if he had succumbed to a gambling addiction or substance use. One woman said she heard he had recently been hospitalized.</p><p>Mr. Scarso, the childhood friend, called again and again, but got no answer.</p><p>In July, a New York court disbarred Mr. Strazzullo, citing professional misconduct.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>And still, the specter of more legal trouble loomed. The civil suits piled up. The next court date was set. And then, it was over before it began.</p><p>Long before sunrise on Aug. 10, the police were called to Mr. Strazzullo’s parents’ home. There, behind the block-like brick house, they discovered Mr. Strazzullo unconscious in the driver’s seat of the Fiat. Emergency medical workers pronounced him dead at the scene.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, the story of the nightlife lawyer’s demise was splashed across the tabloid pages that helped build his career. But in Mr. Strazzullo’s more immediate circles, the news has left many struggling to make sense of what happened to the man they knew as Sal.</p><p>His mother, Nancy, would say only that “he was a wonderful person.” The website for his law practice has been taken offline. His penthouse apartment has a new tenant now.</p><p>The two criminal cases against Mr. Strazzullo were formally dismissed Wednesday, according to prosecutors. It is unclear whether his victims will be compensated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“It was just a complete shock,” Mr. Scarso said. “We’re all wondering why or how or what happened.”</p><p>But Mr. Hay, the gossip columnist who watched Mr. Strazzullo climb the ranks of New York social life for almost 30 years, had a simple explanation:</p><p>“He was always trying to keep up. And in the end, he couldn’t.”</p><p><em>If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in the United States, or go to </em><a href="https://speakingofsuicide.com/resources/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources</em></a><em> for a list of additional resources.
