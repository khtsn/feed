    <h1>Officer Recalls 2002 Standoff With Ryan Routh, Trump Golf Course Suspect</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The police department in Greensboro, N.C., was on the lookout for Ryan W. Routh. He didn’t have a driver’s license, and investigators suspected he had an explosive device. So when Officer Tracy Fulk saw him driving near the Greensboro Coliseum on a cold day in December 2002, she pulled him over.</p><p>As she got close to his small pickup, Ms. Fulk said, she saw Mr. Routh reaching for a duffel bag beside him. He opened it, revealing a firearm.</p><p>“Show me your hands!” she recalled screaming at him. Mr. Routh sped off toward his roofing business in the central North Carolina city, where he barricaded himself inside with a fully automatic weapon, according to a local news report.</p><p>Ms. Fulk, who retired in 2017 after nearly two decades on the force, recounted the confrontation in an interview with The New York Times. Mr. Routh now faces federal weapons charges in Florida after what the authorities have described as an apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald J. Trump.</p></div></div>
