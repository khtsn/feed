</span> has <a href="https://x.com/C9VAL/status/1867064372922814812" target="_blank">announced</a> that <span data-ref-id="1">Kaleb		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7458/moose">moose</a>&#34;
		Jayne</span> has been allowed to explore options as a restricted free agent and is actively searching for a new team. According to the announcement, moose is currently under contract with no buyout. This news comes several days after the team parted ways with <span data-ref-id="2">Daniel		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/1129/rossy">Rossy</a>&#34;
		Abedrabbo</span> and signed <span data-ref-id="3">Mitch		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/612/mitch">mitch</a>&#34;
		Semago</span> in his stead.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBoth parties mutually agree that a change in environment and exploring better options would be the best path to success in the long run,‚Äù the team <a href="https://x.com/C9VAL/status/1867064372922814812" target="_blank">stated</a> regarding the change.</p>

<p>moose joined Cloud9 in March just ahead of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2004/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-1" target="_blank">Americas Stage 1</a> to replace <span data-ref-id="4">Maxim		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4373/wippie">wippie</a>&#34;
		Shepelev</span> on the Sentinel role after the team suffered a 1-2 group stage exit in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1923/champions-tour-2024-americas-kickoff/group-stage" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>. The squad spent the season hovering around the middle of the regional standings. While they managed to qualify for playoffs in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2004/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">both</a> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2095/champions-tour-2024-americas-stage-2" target="_blank">stages</a> and earned a respectable 6-4 regular season record, Cloud9 were ultimately eliminated in the opening knockout round in both instances and failed to qualify for any international events. During the offseason, moose and the team achieved a standout second-place performance at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2171/red-bull-home-ground-5" target="_blank">Red Bull Home Ground</a>. </p>

<p>‚ÄúObviously not happy but I do understand their decision and think it will be better for both parties, wishing them nothing but the best,‚Äù moose <a href="https://x.com/mooseloff/status/1867076091124334996" target="_blank">commented</a>.</p>

<p>As of this time, the team is actively running trials to find a new fifth player. Cloud9 will next return for <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2274/champions-tour-2025-americas-kickoff" target="_blank">Americas Kickoff</a>, which begins Jan. 16.</p>

		<p>Idk what happened between Moose and C9 management, but I am not happy with C9&#39;s management and their decisions. First, They are literally looking for a player before a month for Kickoffs (+ during vacations), second, They removed Rossy (who was literally carrying the team in Rebull HG) and lastly, Removing Moose from the team when almost all the teams have finalized their rosters... Its BS... I hope Moose finds a good team. As for C9, They will bring Vanity or Inspire dk...</p>

			<p>That and bro was a bottom 4 player for his role in Americas last year (and since you ain&#39;t looked at this list he was definitely worse than; zellsis, heat, king, johnap, Asuna, saadhak and then you could make an argument for him playing better than Ethan and nature but it&#39;s not a strong one either way.

<p>Generally when you have a hostile environment, the one person everyone likes is NOT the problem, especially when multiple players kicked vouch for Xeppaa</p>
<p>Also Xeppaa 100% clears Heat, and Zellsis plays different agents. Also primary initiator is THE most selfless role and stats do not even come close to telling the full story</p>		</div>
