President Trump has vowed for months to kill the program.</p><p>The decision grants a key reprieve to the program, the first of its kind in the nation, since Washington ordered New York to shut it down more than three months ago. The toll, which started on Jan. 5, charges most drivers $9 during peak traffic hours, with the goal of reducing gridlock and funding long overdue mass transit improvements.</p><p>Judge Lewis J. Liman granted the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s request for a temporary restraining order following oral arguments from both sides in federal court in Lower Manhattan. The authority, which runs New York City’s mass transit system, operates the toll program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Liman said that New York State “would suffer irreparable harm” without a restraining order against the Trump administration.</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stefanos Chen is a Times reporter covering New York City’s transit system.</p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
