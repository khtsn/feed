President Trump has vowed to kill the toll.</p><p>The decision grants a key reprieve to the program, the first of its kind in the United States, since Washington ordered New York to shut it down more than three months ago. The toll, which started on Jan. 5, charges most drivers $9 during peak traffic hours, with the goal of reducing gridlock and funding long overdue transit improvements.</p><p>Judge Lewis J. Liman granted the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s request for a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration after oral arguments from both sides in federal court in Lower Manhattan. The authority, which runs New York City’s mass transit system, operates the toll program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Liman said that New York State “would suffer irreparable harm” without a restraining order. He also left open the possibility of issuing a longer-term protective order. Judge Liman noted that the M.T.A. “showed a likelihood of success” in its case to maintain congestion pricing.</p><p>Charles Roberts, a lawyer for the Department of Transportation, said the federal government would comply with the judge’s order. A spokesman for the agency added that “the judge’s ruling today was not on the merits of our case against Hochul’s class warfare, but rather a temporary pause to have more time to reach a decision.”</p><p>In a February letter, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said he was revoking federal approval of the toll, because it exceeded the scope of <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/tolling_and_pricing/tolling_pricing/vppp.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the program that authorized it</a>. He said it was an unfair cost to drivers, and that the toll should not primarily fund mass transit projects instead of roads.</p><p>The M.T.A. quickly sued to block Mr. Duffy’s intervention, arguing the program had been thoroughly reviewed, including by federal agencies, and was working. Since the toll started, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/11/upshot/congestion-pricing.html" title="">traffic is down, speeds are up</a> and the authority is on track to use the toll revenue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-revenue-mta.html" title="">to finance $15 billion in critical upgrades</a>.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/mta-congestion-pricing-dot.html" title="">both sides agreeing</a> to let the case play out in court, Mr. Duffy said last month that his agency would begin withholding federal approvals and funding for a range of transportation projects beginning on May 28.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Janno Lieber, the M.T.A.’s chief executive, said he welcomed the judge’s decision.</p><p>“I think the message is he wants no more coercive threats and threats of punishment if we don’t do what they say,” he said.</p><p>In a statement, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said the decision was “a massive victory for New York commuters” and reaffirmed that the state would keep the program running.</p><p>Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer representing the M.T.A., said that the federal government’s efforts to end congestion pricing, even after New York had gained approval, could lead to an “eternal fog of uncertainty” for federally approved programs.</p><p>Kevin Willens, the M.T.A.’s chief financial officer, argued in a letter to the court that Washington’s threats had put the authority in an impossible situation.</p><p>The M.T.A. could either turn off the toll, jeopardizing the $15 billion the program is expected to raise, or it could defy Mr. Duffy’s demands, and face the prospect of losing billions in funding for New York State highway and transit projects.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>.</p><p>Michael Pollack, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law who supports congestion pricing, said that, in most cases, a temporary restraining order cannot be appealed. Though a final judgment still has to be reached in the case, he said, Judge Liman’s comments and decision “certainly bode well for the M.T.A. going forward.”</p><p>Congestion pricing still faces several legal challenges. Jack L. Lester, a lawyer representing New Yorkers Against Congestion Pricing Tax, said the group would fight the program in state court, adding that the federal government’s objections helped their case.</p><p>But some congestion pricing supporters were hopeful that Judge Liman’s decision could signal that the toll program, which had been under attack since its introduction, would soon overcome one of its most formidable challenges. “It looks like the beginning of the end of the administration’s efforts to derail this landmark transportation program,” said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, who attended the court hearing.</p><p>Judge Liman has already rejected a number of other arguments against congestion pricing, in four related cases brought by opponents.</p><p>Congestion pricing remains unpopular among a majority of New Yorkers, but it has made inroads. A <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SNY-May-2025-Poll-Release-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siena College poll</a> in May found that 39 percent of respondents wanted to keep the toll, up from 33 percent in March.</p><p>Voters were more united in how they viewed the president’s intervention. The largest share, 46 percent, said that Ms. Hochul was right to keep fighting the federal government on the issue.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stefanos Chen is a Times reporter covering New York City’s transit system.</p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
