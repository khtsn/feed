data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Many New Yorkers have come to avoid a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan that is perpetually choked by traffic and throngs of tourists clogging the sidewalk.</p><p>Now, there is a plan to restore the luster of the famed thoroughfare by revamping a central portion of it into a showcase boulevard for strolling and shopping, like the Champs-Élysées in Paris, Calle Serrano in Madrid or Bond Street in London.</p><p>Fifth Avenue is home to office towers and luxury stores such as Rolex and Harry Winston. It is also a major transit corridor, with more than 40 local and express bus routes carrying thousands of daily riders. Bus speeds there are among the slowest in the city.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The proposed redesign, which was announced Thursday, would span 20 blocks south of 60th Street, between Central Park and Bryant Park. It would significantly widen the sidewalks, add seating areas and plant more than 200 trees — while taking away two of the avenue’s five traffic lanes.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A rendering of the proposed redevelopment of a stretch of Fifth Avenue between Central Park and Bryant Park, which would include one bus lane, one car lane and one shared lane.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Field Operations, courtesy of City Hall</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was developed by a committee of city officials, business leaders and park stewards, which was formed in late 2022 after previous plans to update Fifth Avenue stalled, including one to create a busway to give buses priority over cars. There have been years of efforts to reimagine the corridor under two different mayoral administrations.</p><p>Street design is often contentious in New York City, where opposing groups fight over every inch of public space. On Thursday, the plan drew support from New Yorkers who welcomed the pedestrian improvements to a chaotic street, but also criticism from drivers who said it would make traffic worse, bus riders who saw it as a step backward from the previous plan for a busway, and cyclists who have pushed for a protected bike lane.</p><p>“An exclusive process produced an incomplete plan that caters to luxury boutiques but ignores how their workers get to work,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for transit riders. “Fifth Avenue should be a busway, prioritizing safety and connectivity for public transit riders, emergency vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists.”</p><p>Still, some transportation experts and urban planners said that it was a good start toward addressing the need for more open space and better mobility, including more protected bike lanes, in the most congested part of the city. Kate Slevin, the executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, which supports the Fifth Avenue redesign, said that “as the plan advances, we hope it can go even farther” and lead to “a longer-term vision of surrounding streets in Midtown.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even before the pandemic, retail sales along Fifth Avenue had lagged as many shoppers stayed away, said Madelyn Wils, the interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association, which runs the business improvement district.</p><p>“The sidewalks are crowded, there’s lots of obstructions and there’s no seating or greenery,” she said.</p><p>Ms. Wils said that remaking Fifth Avenue for pedestrians would increase foot traffic, which in turn would increase property values and retail sales and generate more tax revenue and fees for city coffers.</p><p>More than 5,400 pedestrians an hour, on average, descend on a given block of Fifth Avenue along this Midtown stretch during the evening rush hour — far more than motorists and bus riders — but they have to squeeze into a disproportionately small share of the street space, said <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/115-23/mayor-adams-appoints-ya-ting-liu-nyc-s-first-ever-chief-public-realm-officer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ya-Ting Liu</a>, the city’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/nyregion/public-realm-officer-nyc.html" title="">chief public realm officer</a>.</p><p>Fifth Avenue is 100 feet across, with sidewalks on both sides that take up a total of 46 feet, while the traffic lanes take up 54 feet. Under the new plan, the sidewalks would be expanded to cover a total of 67 feet and the traffic lanes reduced to 33 feet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“For us, it’s really about sort of balancing the street and finally giving pedestrians the space they need on Fifth Avenue,” Ms. Liu said.</p><p>The plan is expected to cost more than $350 million, and would be paid for through public and private financing, according to city officials and business leaders.</p><p>In 2020, Bill de Blasio, then the mayor, announced that the city would carve out a <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/417-20/better-buses-restart-mayor-de-blasio-major-projects-speed-buses-during-city-s-phased" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">busway on Fifth Avenue</a>, which would have severely restricted car traffic to allow buses to move faster between 34th Street and 57th Street. But that project was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/nyregion/fifth-ave-bus-deblasio.html" title="">put on hold indefinitely in 2021</a> after opposition from businesses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rather than adding a bike lane on Fifth Avenue, the new plan would widen a bike lane on Sixth Avenue so that cyclists could travel in both directions.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>There are now two bus lanes and three car lanes on Fifth Avenue. The new plan would keep one bus lane and convert the second into a shared lane. City officials said that, in reality, cars already use that bus lane to make turns off the avenue.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Two of the three car lanes would be removed, including one that is often blocked by delivery trucks and cars pulling over, city officials said.</p><p>A bike lane would not be added. Instead, city officials said, a nearby bike lane on Sixth Avenue would be expanded into a two-way bike lane.</p><p>Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the city’s buses, said that M.T.A. leaders were reviewing the plan. Still, he pointed out that “a proven effective tool for speeding up buses is dedicated bus lanes.”</p><p>Vishaan Chakrabarti, an architect briefed on the redesign and a former director of planning for Manhattan, said that he supports the new plan but he would like to see a protected bike lane on Fifth Avenue or somewhere else on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan. “The West Side has way more bike lanes than the East Side does,” he said, adding that cyclists “need some safe way to navigate in and out of the heart of Midtown.”</p><p>The redesign would also shorten crosswalks on the avenue, a safety measure that allows pedestrians to get across faster, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/nyregion/nyc-raised-crosswalks-traffic-deaths.html" title="">raise them to the level of the sidewalk</a>, essentially creating speed bumps to slow down traffic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The plan would make Fifth Avenue look more like it did a century ago, when the sidewalks were much wider, a former city traffic commissioner said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Todd Heisler/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A public meeting about the plan will be held on Oct. 29, and the overall design could be revised. But the plan does not require major approvals that could block it entirely, city officials said. Construction is expected to begin in 2028.</p><p>The sidewalks on Fifth Avenue were once much wider, but were narrowed in the early 1900s to make more room for traffic, said Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who consulted on a traffic study for the new plan.</p><p>“It’s correcting a mistake that was made a hundred years ago,” he said.</p><p>Historically, he added, traffic volumes have declined on city streets that were redesigned for pedestrians, including stretches of Broadway in Midtown, as drivers found alternate routes or turned to other transportation modes.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/17/nyregion/fifth-avenue-redesign-pedestrians.html">354</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/17/nyregion/fifth-avenue-redesign-pedestrians.html">354</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Racing to Plug a Tunnel Breach:</strong> A leak in the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/nyregion/queens-midtown-tunnel-leak.html">the scramble to repair it</a> revealed the fragility of New York City’s aging transportation network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Going Full Trump:</strong> In one of the most hostile, and consequential, House races in the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/nyregion/marc-molinaro-josh-riley.html">a moderate New York Republican is embracing Donald Trump</a> and leaning heavily on anti-immigrant sentiment.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Co-op Co-Founder Calls It Quits:</strong> In 1973, Joe Holtz helped start the Park Slope Food Co-op, a Brooklyn institution that is equally loved and ridiculed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/nyregion/park-slope-food-coop-joe-holtz.html">Will it survive his retirement?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>What It Costs:</strong> Why does <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/nyc-soft-gel-nail-extensions-price.html">this rainbow gel manicure</a> (with a chrome finish) cost $255?
