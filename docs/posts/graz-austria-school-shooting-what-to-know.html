The gunman, a former student, was also found dead, in an apparent suicide, the police said.</p><p>It was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/multiple-people-killed-in-austria-school-shooting-official-says.html" title="">deadliest attack</a> in recent Austrian history and one of the deadliest recent school shootings in Europe.</p><p>The Austrian chancellor, Christian Stocker, called the shooting a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/multiple-people-killed-in-austria-school-shooting-official-says.html" title="">national tragedy</a>” and declared three days of mourning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-3fee16dc">What happened?</h2><p>Officials said that the gunman, 21, opened fire on Tuesday morning at BORG Dreierschützengasse, where he was a former student. He was found dead in a school bathroom. The police have not released the suspect’s name.</p><p>The police said they received reports of a shooting around 10 a.m. on Tuesday and responded with heavy force. Specially trained COBRA units — Austria’s version of SWAT teams — arrived at the scene, as did a police helicopter. More than 300 officers responded.</p><p>The school was evacuated in the late morning, with students sent to a nearby stadium. </p><p>Austrian schools were closed on Monday for the Pentecost holiday, so students had just returned to classes after a long weekend.</p><h2 id="link-3d0bf8d7">What’s known about the suspect and the victims?</h2><p>Austrian officials said that six of those killed on campus were female and three were male. Another victim, a woman, later died at a hospital. Authorities said they would not release more information on the victims until preliminary investigations were finished.</p><p>The police said the gunman attended the school but did not graduate. He arrived there on Tuesday armed with a pistol and a longer weapon; the police did not clarify whether it was a shotgun or a rifle. Officials said he had acquired the weapons legally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-63b97ee2">How rare are mass shootings in Austria?</h2><p>There were two mass shootings in Austria between 2000 and 2022, both since 2010, according to an <a href="https://rockinst.org/blog/public-mass-shootings-around-the-world-prevalence-context-and-prevention/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a> published in 2024 by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, a think tank based in Albany, N.Y. During that period, there were 109 mass shootings in the United States, according to the institute’s records.</p><p>Graz, Austria’s second-largest city after the capital, Vienna, last experienced a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33211479" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass attack</a> in 2015, when a man with a history of domestic violence<span>  </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000003753981/three-dead-as-car-speeds-into-shoppers-in-austria.html" title="">drove a car into crowds</a> and then attacked bystanders with a knife. Three people were killed.</p><p>Austria has also had terrorism-related violence in the past few years.</p><p>In 2024, security officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/cia-isis-warning-taylor-swift-concert.html" title="">thwarted a plot</a> to attack people at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. In 2020, a gunman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/world/europe/vienna-attack-shooter.html" title="">killed four people</a> and wounded 23 others in Vienna. The man had previously been arrested on suspicion of trying to join ISIS.</p><h2 id="link-16e047a1">Are guns common in Austria?</h2><p>Austrian civilians are among the most heavily armed in the world, according to a 2017 <a href="https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/sites/default/files/resources/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimate from the Small Arms Survey</a>, a research group based in Geneva.</p><p>At the time, Austria ranked 12th in the world in gun holding per person, the data show. Austrians held about 2.6 million guns, <a href="https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/database/global-firearms-holdings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the survey</a>, or about 30 firearms for every 100 civilians. The United States then had about 120.5 guns for every 100 people, the survey showed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Aaron Karp, a senior consultant at the Small Arms Survey, said in a phone interview that there were 1.4 million registered firearms in Austria as of early 2023, citing data provided by the Austrian government. </p><p>“Austria, in many respects, has just been extremely lucky,” said Mr. Karp,<span>  </span>who described the country as having both “a strong gun culture” and “relatively low homicide figures.”</p><p>Pump-action shotguns are <a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/themen/gesetze_und_recht/waffenrecht/Seite.2450100.html#AllgemeineInformationen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prohibited in Austria</a>, which has a population of 9.2 million. And official authorization is required to legally acquire a handgun, a semiautomatic firearm or a repeating shotgun. Austrians must be 21 years old to legally acquire most pistols or semiautomatic weapons, Mr. Karp said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amelia Nierenberg is a breaking news reporter for The Times in London, covering international news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
