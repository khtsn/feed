data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Put your phone down, and back slowly away from those election forecasts. In a presidential race that has remained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">stubbornly close</a> for weeks, nothing short of a campaign-shattering seismic event is likely to budge the polls much in the next few days.</p><p>But the polls have much to offer beyond the horse race. Throughout this campaign, pollsters have been asking voters a broad range of questions, and the answers will help tell the story of this election and provide valuable context in the weeks to come.</p><h3 id="link-4951d8c2"><span>Who represents ‘change’?</span></h3><p>Consider this: For more than a decade, most Americans have been saying that the country is <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/direction-of-the-united-states" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the wrong track</a>, and this election cycle is no different. On average, <a href="https://elections2024.thehill.com/national/right-wrong-track/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about two-thirds of Americans</a> are saying it right now. Former President Donald J. Trump has broadly campaigned by promising a return to a prosperous past, and Vice President Kamala Harris on moving toward a brighter future. The question is, which direction do voters think they want to go?</p><p>Mr. Trump has highlighted Ms. Harris’s role in President Biden’s administration, while she has made the promise of “not going back” to Mr. Trump’s era and brand of politics. These are strategic decisions when considered in terms of other common polling metrics: job approval and favorability. Job approval measures how many voters approve or disapprove of how a candidate is doing their job (or did their job, in Mr. Trump’s case). Favorability, obviously, measures whether voters express a favorable or unfavorable view of them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Currently, Mr. Biden has a favorability rating of 40 percent on average and a 38 percent approval rating, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a tracker from FiveThirtyEight</a>. When Mr. Trump left office, his <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">average was 39 percent</a>, but in recent polls Americans have been more generous (as they’ve <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/508625/retrospective-approval-jfk-rises-trump.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tended to be after presidents have left office</a>), giving his performance a 48 percent approval rating in an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dead-heat-trump-pulls-even-harris-nbc-news-poll-rcna174201" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">October NBC News poll</a>. While the Trump campaign aims to tie Ms. Harris’s fortunes to those of President Biden and his low ratings, the Harris campaign hopes to remind voters of how they felt about Mr. Trump when he was in office.</p><p>“When you have an incumbent president whose job approval nationally is in the high 30s, that’s just got to be a huge burden on the party trying to retain the White House,” said Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School Poll.</p><p>That said, Ms. Harris’s numbers have been much more positive than Mr. Biden’s. On July 21, the day Ms. Harris began her campaign, her average favorability rating was 38 percent; by Oct. 31, it had climbed to 46 percent. Over the same period, her job approval rating also improved, to 44 percent now from 38 percent on July 21.</p><p>But while voters may have a warmer view of Ms. Harris, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they believe she would offer a meaningful change from the current administration, and that could be a problem for her.</p><p>“The American public has been telling us for two decades that they want ‘change,’” said Chris Jackson, who heads U.S. public opinion research for Ipsos Public Polling. “This election cycle it’s sort of an open question which one of these two candidates actually represents ‘change.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Both candidates could reasonably make the argument that they are the “change” candidate. In fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/harris-trump-poll-national.html" title="">both of them have</a>. But it’s also easy to see them as representing familiar philosophies, and voters have been split. When asked in separate questions in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/19/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html" title="">a New York Times/Siena College poll</a> whether they thought each candidate represented change, likely voters were more inclined to say it of Mr. Trump: 59 percent said so, while 45 percent said the same of Ms. Harris.</p><p>But when asked in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html" title="">a later survey</a> whether “represents change” better describes Mr. Trump or Ms. Harris, likely voters said it was Ms. Harris, 46 percent to 44 percent.</p><h3 id="link-22cfc0ac"><span><strong>What’s on our minds?</strong></span></h3><p>The economy has consistently been voters’ No. 1 priority this election, and in every New York Times/Siena College poll this year, more voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/elections/trump-harris-economy-poll.html" title="">chose it as their top issue</a> than any other. And more likely voters say they trust Mr. Trump on the economy than Ms. Harris, though that edge may be shrinking.</p><p>“We may look back and say, ‘well, this all makes sense,’ if Trump wins,” said David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. “The two most important issues to all voters were the economy and immigration and Trump has the edge on both of those.”</p><p>However, in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/03/us/elections/times-siena-battleground-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">most recent Times/Siena poll of battleground states</a>, those priorities weren’t as stark. The economy was still the most-cited answer for the top issue, by 24 percent of likely voters, compared with 27 percent in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/27/us/elections/times-siena-poll-crosstabs.html" title="">last national poll</a>. Abortion was listed as the top issue by 18 percent of likely voters in the battleground states, compared with 15 percent nationally, while immigration was named as the top issue by the same share as had named it nationally, 15 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cross-tabs, the breakdown of polling results by subpopulations such as age and gender, are tricky to parse. Because they represent smaller samples, their margin of error is higher than that of the overall poll. That said, general themes across multiple polls show gaps emerging between voting groups.</p><p>When it comes to their top issues, in the national poll, Republicans were more likely (41 percent) than Democrats (12 percent) to list the economy, while a higher share of Democrats (28 percent) said it was abortion. The economy and abortion were cited as the top issue by an equal share of women, but abortion was not even among the top three issues for men. And men were more likely than women to list immigration as their top issue, as were Republicans compared with Democrats.</p><p>We’re also seeing stark gaps in candidate choice by sex. On average, Ms. Harris leads Mr. Trump among women by 10 percentage points, while Mr. Trump leads Ms. Harris by eight, according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16D9GSxqF5LFIRTcoVJlvWWefU_h-ZMzlomghgbvYRaM/edit?gid=118915609#gid=118915609" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an aggregation of poll results</a> from the last two weeks collected by a former Democratic pollster, Adam Carlson. There’s an even starker sex divide among young people; across three Times/Siena polls this fall, Mr. Trump led Ms. Harris among young men by 21 percentage points, while Ms. Harris led him among young women by nearly 40.</p><h3 id="link-764b325a"><span>Voters are not always one-dimensional</span></h3><p>All of this data is painting a complex picture of voters as we head into Election Day. It could even result in some surprising results, such as split-ticket voting across some states.</p><p>In Arizona, for instance, voters will be deciding on a ballot measure to codify “the fundamental right to an abortion” in the State Constitution, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/arizona-abortion-ballot-measure.html" title="">a majority of likely voters there support</a> (54 percent in the latest Times/Siena poll). At the same time, more of those voters cited immigration as their top issue than abortion, and they’ll also be voting on a ballot measure on that issue, to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5126525/arizona-ballot-initiative-immigration" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decide if illegal border crossings</a> should be a state crime. In the presidential race, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-arizona.html" title="">Mr. Trump has pulled ahead in the polls</a>, but in the Senate contest, the Democratic candidate, Representative Rubén Gallego, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-senate-arizona.html" title="">is leading</a> by four points.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There’s 10 states with abortion on the ballot, does that impact female turnout in the state?” said Camille Mumford, the director of communications for Emerson College Polling. “Immigration, too, is on the ballot in Arizona, so will one of those have more of an impact?”</p><p>While these patterns can’t necessarily help predict who is going to win on Tuesday, they provide valuable context that, in retrospect, may help explain why exactly voters made the choices that they did.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kaleigh Rogers is a Times reporter covering election polls and the polling industry.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kaleigh-rogers">More about Kaleigh Rogers</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
