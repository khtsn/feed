Mr. Trump said he appreciated the message, and had received “strong signals” from Russia that the country was eager for peace.</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>He was less conciliatory toward Canada, Mexico and China after imposing tariffs earlier in the day that roiled global markets and drew rebukes from the countries’ leaders. The president said nothing in his speech Tuesday night to suggest that an extended trade war might yet be averted.</p><p>“Whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them,” he said. “Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Together, the president’s remarks underscored the chaotic, whiplash nature of the opening weeks of Mr. Trump’s second term. Much of the lengthy speech was filled with grievances about his treatment by Democrats and exaggerations about his accomplishments. It capped a six-week blitz of actions since Mr. Trump took office, a period in which he has fired government workers, frozen foreign aid, upended international alliances, pardoned rioters and issued a flood of executive orders.</p><p>“Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America,” Mr. Trump said, repeatedly appearing to veer from his prepared remarks. “From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.”</p><p>From the first moments of his address, Mr. Trump faced heckling from Democrats as he declared that he had won a mandate from voters and that “America is back.” Democrats barely applauded, while Republicans enthusiastically cheered. When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/al-green-trump-speech-heckling.html" title="">Representative Al Green</a>, a Democratic lawmaker from Texas, yelled “you have no mandate to cut Medicaid” and refused to sit down, it exposed the deep divisions in Congress and the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, shouted at Mr. Trump during the speech and was escorted out of the chamber.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Capitol Police officers pushing back journalists trying to reach Mr. Green after he was escorted out of the chamber.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Mr. Green, take your seat,” Speaker Mike Johnson ordered him.</p><p>When he refused, he was escorted out.</p><p>“The people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements,” Mr. Trump said, striking a note of self-pity that he had not gained acceptance from Democrats in the chamber. “They won’t do it no matter what.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There have been other outbursts during presidential speeches in recent years, including by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, during the Biden administration and Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, during the Obama administration. Both remained in the chamber after interrupting the president.</p><p>Just days after threatening to abandon a European ally at war and kicking off a trade war, Mr. Trump offered no new policy proposals, repeatedly denigrated former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and mocked Democrats in the audience for their inability to stand in the way of his agenda.</p><p>The president did not dwell on foreign policy, though he again threatened to annex the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/blackrock-panama-canal-ports-hutchison.html" title="">Panama Canal,</a> saying that “my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it.”</p><p>He said he wanted to construct a “golden dome” to protect the United States from missile strikes and create a new shipbuilding office, and he tried to entice Greenland to leave Denmark and join the United States. He also announced that the United States had apprehended a terrorist who organized the bombing of the Abbey Gate during the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Trump spent much of his time telling the stories of Americans he invited to watch his address in the gallery, including the victims of violent immigrants and a boy with cancer who dreamed of becoming a police officer.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump announced that a 13-year-old boy with cancer had been made a Secret Service agent.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Throughout, he appeared to obsess over his political rivals. At one point, he motioned to Democrats, saying the system of justice in the country had been taken over by “radical left lunatics.” In response, progressive members of the party held up panels that said “False” and “That’s a lie.”</p><p>A number of Democrats staged a small protest, standing up and turning their backs toward Trump with T-shirts that said “resist” on the back. Instead of risking being removed by the sergeant-at-arms, the group quietly walked off the House floor.</p><p>Other Democrats chose to walk out of the speech, including Representative Maxwell Frost, Democrat of Florida, who wore a shirt that said “No Kings Live Here.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I could not in good conscience sit through this speech and give an audience to someone who operates with lawless disregard for Congress and the people of this nation,” said Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts.</p><p>Mr. Trump accused Democrats of ignoring the “common-sense revolution” that he and his administration had begun to put in place. He addressed his opponents in the audience with contempt, gloating about his election victory, mocked them for his ability to evade prosecutions and called Mr. Biden the worst president in American history.</p><p>At one point, the president compared the treatment he received on the internet to the victims of revenge porn, saying “nobody gets treated worse than I do online.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Democratic lawmakers wore bright pink to protest Mr. Trump. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Jasmine Crockett, Democrat of Texas, held up a sign protesting Elon Musk.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Trump claimed falsely that he had inherited an “economic catastrophe” from Mr. Biden. In fact, the United States had the strongest economy in the world when Mr. Trump took over, but it has been showing signs of strain in recent weeks amid federal funding cuts and tariffs.</p><p>The president focused on what he claimed was fraud in the federal bureaucracy discovered by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. For several minutes, Mr. Trump listed off foreign aid and diversity programs that his government had eliminated, mocking them as unnecessary.</p><p>“Eight million to promote L.G.B.T.Q.I.+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of,” the president said.</p><p>House Republican leaders have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/gop-town-hall.html" title="">advised their members to stop holding in-person town halls</a> amid a torrent of large-scale protests targeting some of the budget cuts Mr. Musk is overseeing. Even so, a number of Republican lawmakers jumped to their feet and cheered as the president referred to Mr. Musk, who was sitting in the gallery.</p><p>As he had in past speeches, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/05/us/trump-speech-congress" title="">repeated false and exaggerated claims throughout the speech</a>, prompting reactions from the Democrats in the chamber.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“That’s not true,” Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the former House speaker, said quietly and shook her head as Mr. Trump ticked through debunked claims about the impossible ages of people collecting Social Security. Republicans, in contrast, cracked up, and one yelled out “Joe Biden” when Trump asserted that someone on Social Security was older than 300.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump boasted about the pace of his administration’s achievements.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress may have looked like a State of the Union speech and sounded like one, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/trump-speech-congress-state-of-the-union.html" title="">but it was not — at least not technically</a>. Starting with Ronald Reagan in 1981, all presidents have delivered speeches to Congress shortly after their inauguration, and then again each year. Only those after their first year in office are considered to be State of the Union addresses.</p><p>A tradition begun by George Washington, the annual speech was discontinued by the third president, Thomas Jefferson, who opted for a written report. The speech was revived by Woodrow Wilson in 1913.</p><p>Before the speech began, Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said he hoped some of Mr. Trump’s more extreme moves were only temporary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“It’s a pause, not a stop; I think it’s part of a negotiation,” Mr. Thune said of the freeze in aid to Ukraine. Of the new tariffs, Mr. Thune said: “These tariffs, I think, are hopefully temporary.”</p><p>House Republicans were decidedly more excited.</p><p>Speaker Mike Johnson said ahead of the speech: “I would like to frame it in gilded gold.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael D.
