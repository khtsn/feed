The condition of Mr. Grimm, a Republican and former F.B.I. agent and Marine who resigned from Congress in 2015 and served seven months in prison for tax fraud, was first reported by a colleague from Newsmax, where Mr. Grimm had found a second career as an on-air personality.</p><p>The colleague, Greg Kelly, said <a href="https://wabcradio.com/episode/hour-1-i-wish-michael-grimm-a-speedy-recovery-09-23-24/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on his radio show</a> that the accident happened during a polo tournament on Sept. 22. He required emergency surgery, Mr. Kelly said. </p><p>“He’s a great horseman, and he was thrown from the horse and seriously damaged his neck,” Mr. Kelly said on the program. “Please say a prayer.”</p><p>Vincent Ignizio, a former city councilman from Staten Island and a friend of Mr. Grimm, said the former representative was paralyzed from the chest down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Grimm, who first won election to the House in 2010, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/nyregion/representative-michael-grimm-is-indicted-on-fraud-charges.html" title="">was indicted in 2014</a> after failing to report nearly a million dollars in gross receipts from a restaurant he had owned in Manhattan called Healthalicious, and lying about it under oath.</p><p>After winning re-election later that year, he pleaded guilty to felony tax evasion and resigned his seat representing the 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and a part of Brooklyn, in January 2015. He was later <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/former-united-states-congressman-michael-grimm-sentenced-eight-months-tax-fraud" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sentenced to eight months</a> in prison, serving seven.</p><p>After his release, Mr. Grimm <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/nyregion/staten-island-congressman-grimm.html" title="">ran in the 2018 midterms to recapture his old House seat</a>, but lost in the primary to Representative Dan Donovan, the incumbent. Mr. Donovan ultimately lost to Max Rose, a Democrat.</p><p>In 2022, Mr. Grimm traveled to Ukraine, according to his website, GrimmReporting.com, as an at-large correspondent for Newsmax, reporting on the ground from the conflict zone.</p><p>Since his fall in September, Mr. Grimm has remained hospitalized, first at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., and then at Kindred Hospital East New Jersey in Passaic, according to Mr. Ignizio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Grimm’s initial emergency surgery was successful, but he later contracted pneumonia, which he battled for weeks, Mr. Ignizio said.</p><p>The former representative is now staying at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in New Jersey, the same institute that oversaw the recovery of the actor Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed in a horse fall in 1995.</p><p>“If there is anybody that can show the strength and fortitude and will to ensure his full recovery, it’s Michael Grimm,” Mr. Ignizio said. “He’s a tough Marine and a tough patriot, and we are all just praying.”</p><p>Mr. Grimm was known for his pugnacious attitude as a representative. In 2014, he threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony who was questioning him about a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/nyregion/rep-michael-grimm-threat-ny1-reporter.html" title="">Mr. Grimm subsequently apologized.</a></p><p>An online fund-raiser for Mr. Grimm, which was started this week, set the cost of his ongoing medical needs at $2.5 million.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“He has been in the most devastating of situations and through the grace of God, Mr. Grimm has miraculously thread the needle to survive,” the fund-raising site read.</p><p>Mr. Ignizio said that Mr. Grimm had received donations from both sides of the aisle, including from former opponents. “It’s been really heartening,” he said. “This is who we are, and we are going to all pull together to fight for him.”</p><p>Mr. Grimm had long been passionate about polo, Mr. Ignizio said, regularly competing in tournaments in the Hudson Valley. On Aug. 31, Mr. Grimm posted a picture on X of him standing beside a chestnut horse that was wearing a Trump 2024 visor, its forelock sticking out.</p><p>“Meet Leonidas my Republican horse,” Mr. Grimm wrote, adding that Leonidas urged people to vote for Donald J. Trump.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><svg id="election2020brand" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 25" width="80" height="20" aria-label="Election 2024"><rect width="25" height="25" fill="#f4564a"></rect><path d="m17.5,19.4H7.4v-2c.8-.8,1.7-1.5,2.6-2.2.7-.6,1.3-1.1,1.9-1.7,1.3-1.2,1.7-2.1,1.7-3.1,0-.8-.4-1.5-1.3-1.5-.8,0-1.6.6-2,2l-3-.9c.9-2.8,2.9-3.8,5.2-3.8,2.6,0,4.8,1.2,4.8,4.1,0,2.7-2.5,4.6-4.6,6.1h4.7v3h.1Z" fill="#fff"></path><rect x="25" width="25" height="25" fill="#2b8ad8"></rect><path d="m37.5,19.6c-3,0-5.3-2.4-5.3-6.7,0-3.9,1.9-6.7,5.3-6.7s5.3,2.9,5.3,6.7c0,4.1-2.1,6.7-5.3,6.7Zm0-10.9c-1.5,0-1.7,1.5-1.7,4.2,0,3,.3,4.1,1.7,4.1s1.7-1.1,1.7-4.1c0-2.7-.2-4.2-1.7-4.2Z" fill="#fff"></path><rect x="50" width="25" height="25" fill="#f4564a"></rect><rect x="75" width="25" height="25" fill="#2b8ad8"></rect><path d="m17.5,19.4H7.4v-2c.8-.8,1.7-1.5,2.6-2.2.7-.6,1.3-1.1,1.9-1.7,1.3-1.2,1.7-2.1,1.7-3.1,0-.8-.4-1.5-1.3-1.5-.8,0-1.6.6-2,2l-3-.9c.9-2.8,2.9-3.8,5.2-3.8,2.6,0,4.8,1.2,4.8,4.1,0,2.7-2.5,4.6-4.6,6.1h4.7v3h.1Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="m67.5,19.4h-10.1v-2c.8-.8,1.7-1.5,2.6-2.2.7-.6,1.3-1.1,1.9-1.7,1.3-1.2,1.7-2.1,1.7-3.1,0-.8-.4-1.5-1.3-1.5-.8,0-1.6.6-2,2l-3-.9c.9-2.8,2.9-3.8,5.2-3.8,2.6,0,4.8,1.2,4.8,4.1,0,2.7-2.5,4.6-4.6,6.1h4.7v3h.1Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="m92.68344,16.625h-1.94824v2.79688h-3.50977v-2.79688h-5.3623v-2.5459l5.6709-7.65723h3.20117v7.6377h1.94824v2.56543Zm-5.34277-2.56543v-3.87646l-2.87402,3.87646h2.87402Z" fill="#fff"></path></svg><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the 2024 Election</h2><hr/><p><strong>Aftermath of the Election</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Drop-Off in Democratic Turnout: </strong>Voters in liberal strongholds across the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/democrats-trump-harris-turnout.html">failed to show up to vote for Kamala Harris</a> at the levels they had for Joe Biden four years earlier, contributing significantly to her defeat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeking Revenge: </strong>Donald<strong> </strong>Trump spent much of the campaign focused on exacting “retribution,” leaving allies and adversaries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/politics/trump-enemies-prosecution.html">anticipating a wave of payback</a> after he returns to power.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Trump Insiders: </strong>As Trump’s team ramps up the transition process, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-administration-insiders.html">here are some of the key people</a> who will have an outsized influence on his cabinet.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Presidential Transition</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Lee Zeldin: </strong>Trump will nominate the former New York congressman to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/climate/trump-chooses-lee-zeldin-to-run-epa.html">lead the E.P.A.</a>, a position that is expected to be central to Trump’s plans to dismantle landmark climate regulations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stephen Miller: </strong>The immigration hard-liner and adviser to Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html">expected to be named deputy chief of staff</a>, according to people briefed on the matter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elise Stefanik: </strong>In one of his first cabinet-level personnel decisions, Trump offered the Republican member of Congress from New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-stefanik-un-ambassador.html">the role of U.N. ambassador</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>More News and Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Nancy Pelosi: </strong>In her first extended interview after the Democrats’ defeat, the former House speaker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/magazine/nancy-pelosi-election-interview.html">insisted the election was not a rebuke of her party</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>California’s Methodical Count: </strong>Ten of the 18 races that will determine which party controls the House are in California. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/california-ballot-count-house-election.html">No state takes longer to tally votes</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unions Brace for Blowback: </strong>Government unions, service worker unions and industrial unions bet big on Harris.
