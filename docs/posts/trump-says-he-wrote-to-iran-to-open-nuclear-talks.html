    <h1>Trump Says He Wrote to Iran to Open Nuclear Talks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the interview, with the Fox host Maria Bartiromo, Mr. Trump described his letter as saying, “I hope you’re going to negotiate because it’s going to be a lot better for Iran.”</p><p>“If we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing for them,” he said, adding: “The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can’t let them have a nuclear weapon.”</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump talked more broadly about his desire to see the world’s countries eliminate their nuclear weapons. He said he hoped to negotiate denuclearization efforts with China and Russia as well.</p><p>“It would great if everybody would get rid of their nuclear weapons,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.</p><p>In Iran, officials have vigorously debated whether to negotiate with Mr. Trump. Moderate and reformist factions, which hold the presidency, are in favor of talks, while hard-line conservatives oppose them. Iran’s economy is in shambles because of international sanctions and mismanagement, and President Masoud Pezeshkian was elected last year largely because of his pledges to improve the economy by negotiating directly with Washington.</p></div></div>
