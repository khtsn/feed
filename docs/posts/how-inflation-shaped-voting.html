    <h1>How Inflation Shaped Voting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Why did Donald Trump defeat Kamala Harris? One answer was clear even before Election Day: Voters consistently said the economy was their top issue, driven primarily by concerns about inflation. And they trusted Trump more than Harris to handle it. “It’s the economy, stupid” is an old cliché in American politics, and it often proves true.</p><p>Still, Trump’s achievement contained a mystery. On paper, the economy seems OK. Inflation is down recently. Wages are up. But anger persists. That’s because higher prices cause a special kind of pain — one that lingers and, historically, leads <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33068" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voters to punish the people in charge</a>. Tuesday was no exception.</p><p>Today’s newsletter explains why voters still blamed the Biden-Harris administration — and why America’s leaders are far from alone in feeling the public’s fury over inflation this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: National Consumer Price Index statistics for each country | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Why does inflation anger voters so much? Some economic problems, like high unemployment, affect only a minority of the population. But higher prices affect everyone.</p><p>Inflation also taps into what psychologists call “loss aversion”: People feel negatively about losses much more than they feel positively about gains. So although wages have kept up with inflation or surpassed it, people still feel more pained by sticker shock at the grocery store than elated by their gains.</p><p>To make matters worse, consumers can’t do much about inflation. They simply have to cut back their spending on certain things or work more hours to afford them. The sense of loss combined with a feeling of powerlessness leaves people furious. They expect their leaders to fix the problem.</p><p>Inflation fell to normal levels over the past year, but high prices remain. Eggs still cost nearly triple what they did four years ago. When people imagine an ideal end to inflation, they think of prices returning to normal. That hasn’t happened, and economists don’t expect it will. When the polling firm Morning Consult <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/inflation-definition-consumer-survey-understanding" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveyed U.S. voters about inflation</a>, they were comparing prices with those from 2020. They blamed President Biden and Harris for the increases since then, fairly or not.</p><p>“Americans were comparing this economy to one without inflation, whether or not that was a realistic option according to economists,” said my colleague Ben Casselman, who covers the U.S. economy. “They weren’t saying, ‘Inflation is tough, but at least I have a job thanks to Biden.’ They were saying, ‘Of course I have a job, but now I have to deal with all this inflation thanks to Biden.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the same time, the solutions to inflation can make the problem feel worse in the short term. To stop price increases, central banks raised interest rates. That made loans, credit card payments and mortgages more expensive — another set of higher costs that consumers had to deal with.</p><h2 id="link-7caebe09">Global rage</h2><p>The same dynamic is haunting leaders all over the world. Over the past few years, voters have thrown out incumbents, on the left and the right, in Britain, France, the Netherlands, Argentina, Italy and Australia. The top political parties in South Africa, Japan and India also faced disappointing elections. Canada’s and Germany’s incumbents are in danger of losing their jobs next year.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Morning Consult | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Higher prices are the central reason. In the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, prices spiked worldwide.</p><p>There is some good news for world leaders: Most prices have stabilized as the shocks of the pandemic and Russia’s war have subsided. If that trend continues, voters’ anger will likely ease.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>There are already some signs of that growing optimism. The Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/business/fed-interest-rates" title="">cut interest rates yesterday</a>, signaling that inflation will continue falling. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, which measures people’s faith in the economy and their finances, has improved over the past year. The improvement, however, was too little and too late for Harris’s presidential campaign.</p><h2 id="link-1433a002">More on Trump’s win</h2><ul><li><p>Trump looks set to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-popular-vote-election-2024.html" title="">win the national popular vote</a>, which would make him the first Republican presidential candidate to do so in 20 years.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/trump-america-red-shift-victory.html" title="">See the voting groups that swung to the right</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trump won votes from Arab Americans and conservative pro-Israel Jews, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-arab-american-jews.html" title="">groups with very different views</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-cba023e">House results</h2><ul><li><p>Republicans are seven seats away from a House majority and appear to be poised to achieve that.
