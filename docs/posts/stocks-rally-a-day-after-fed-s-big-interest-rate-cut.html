The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy rose about 1.8 percent on Thursday.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has repeatedly butted up against the record in recent weeks, lifted recently as investors anticipated a big cut to interest rates. On Wednesday, the Fed met those expectations by lowering its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point, double the typical quarter-point adjustment the central bank typically makes.</p><p>Though stocks had wobbled in the immediate aftermath of the rate cut, closing slightly lower on Wednesday, optimism took hold in the markets overnight. It often takes the market a day or two to determine a path after a big event like the Fed meeting. Lower rates are generally good news for stock investors: lower borrowing costs boost corporate profits and increase the value of investors’ holdings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This can only be a good thing for equities,” said Colin Graham, head of multi asset strategies at Robeco, an asset management firm.</p><p>Investors also have to consider, however, that the Fed’s aggressive cutting could mean that policymakers are worried about the economy.</p><p>On Wednesday, Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, appeared to tread that tightrope carefully.</p><p>“The U.S. economy is in a good place, and our decision today is designed to keep it there,” Mr. Powell said at a news conference after the rate decision was announced.</p><p>Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at the retail brokerage firm LPL Financial, said that “they made it clear that this is not an emergency rate cut,” which would have spooked the market.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Financial markets themselves may have been at play in the Fed’s decision to opt for a bigger half percentage cut, said Naomi Fink, a global strategist at Nikko Asset Management. Investors had placed bets on a larger cut leading up to the Fed’s meeting.</p><p>“It is possible that the Fed viewed such conditions as a good time to buy insurance,” Ms. Fink said, “while the markets were likely to absorb it well, in case conditions were not so amenable in the future.”</p><p>The question left lingering in investors’ minds is whether companies can continue to deliver the financial results to justify such lofty valuations. And that’s not the only risk. Geopolitics, the U.S. presidential election and a softening labor market could also curtail the rally over the next couple of months.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/federal-reserve-the-fed">Federal Reserve (The Fed)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/jerome-powell">Jerome Powell</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
