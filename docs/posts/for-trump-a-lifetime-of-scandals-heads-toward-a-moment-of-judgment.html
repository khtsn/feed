Trump after one of his four indictments, staring into the camera with his signature glare. It is an image not of shame but of defiance, the image of a man who would be a convicted felon before Election Day and yet possibly president of the United States again afterward.</p><p>Sometimes lost amid all the shouting of a high-octane campaign heading into its final couple of weeks is that simple if mind-bending fact. America for the first time in its history may send a criminal to the Oval Office and entrust him with the nuclear codes. What would once have been automatically disqualifying barely seems to slow Mr. Trump down in his comeback march for a second term that he says will be devoted to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/trump-2024-president.html" title="">“retribution.”</a></p><p>In all the different ways that Mr. Trump has upended the traditional rules of American politics, that may be one of the most striking. He has survived more scandals than any major party presidential candidate, much less president, in the life of the republic. Not only survived but thrived. He has turned them on their head, making allegations against him into an argument for him by casting himself as a serial victim rather than a serial violator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>His persecution defense, the notion that he gets in so much trouble only because everyone is out to get him, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5074105/this-vicious-persecution-travesty-justice" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resonates at his rallies</a> where he says “they’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you, and I’m just standing in the way.” But that of course belies a record of scandal stretching across his 78 years starting long before politics. Whether in his personal life or his public life, he has been accused of so many acts of wrongdoing, investigated by so many prosecutors and agencies, sued by so many plaintiffs and claimants that it requires a scorecard just to remember them all.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/20dc-trump-scandals-mug-zptc/20dc-trump-scandals-mug-zptc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/20dc-trump-scandals-mug-zptc/20dc-trump-scandals-mug-zptc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/20/multimedia/20dc-trump-scandals-mug-zptc/20dc-trump-scandals-mug-zptc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="People sitting in rows, some holding signs supporting Donald J.

He was taken to court for stiffing his vendors, stiffing his bankers and even stiffing his own family. He avoided the draft during the Vietnam War and avoided paying any income taxes for years. He was forced to shell out tens of millions of dollars to students who accused him of scamming them, found liable for wide-scale business fraud and had his real estate firm convicted in criminal court of tax crimes.</p><p>He has boasted of grabbing women by their private parts, been reported to have cheated on all three of his wives and been accused of sexual misconduct by more than two dozen women, including one whose account was validated by a jury that found him liable for sexual abuse after a civil trial.</p><p>He is the only president in American history impeached twice for high crimes and misdemeanors, the only president ever indicted on criminal charges and the only president to be convicted of a felony (34, in fact). He used the authority of his office to punish his adversaries and tried to hold onto power on the basis of a brazen lie.</p><p>Mr. Trump beat some of the investigations and lawsuits against him and some proved unfounded, but the sheer volume is remarkable. Any one of those scandals by itself would typically have been enough to derail another politician. Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s first bid for the presidency collapsed when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/24/us/biden-withdraws-bid-for-president-in-wake-of-furor.html" title="">lifted some words</a> from another politician’s speech. George W. Bush came close to losing after the last-minute revelation of a long-ago <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/03/us/2000-campaign-driving-offense-bush-acknowledges-arrest-for-drunken-driving-1976.html" title="">drunken-driving arrest</a>. Hillary Rodham Clinton fell short at least in part because of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/hilary-clinton-male-voters-donald-trump.html" title="">F.B.I. investigation into emails</a> that led to no charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Not Mr. Trump. He has moved from one furor to the next without any of them sinking into the body politic enough to end his career. The unrelenting pace of scandals may in its own way help him by keeping any single one of them from dominating the national conversation and eroding his standing with his base of supporters.</p><p>He even turned that mug shot into a marketing tool, selling T-shirts, posters, bumper stickers, coffee mugs and even beverage coolers with the image and the slogan “NEVER SURRENDER.” And victory next month may yet help him escape the biggest threat of all — potentially prison.</p><p>Nonetheless, the full record stands out.</p><h2 id="link-49ca0b51">Making and Losing Money</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump and his father, Fred Trump, at a construction project in Brooklyn in 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Barton Silverman/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump got an early start learning how to cut corners. As a high school student at New York Military Academy, he knowingly borrowed a friend’s dress jacket with a dozen medals attached to wear for his yearbook photo, in effect appropriating medals that he did not win himself, according to a new book, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/books/review/lucky-loser-russ-buettner-susanne-craig.html" title="">“Lucky Loser,”</a> by Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig of The New York Times.</p><p>He likewise cheated to get into college, according to his estranged niece, Mary L. Trump. The future president paid a friend to take the SAT for him, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/us/politics/mary-trump-book.html" title="">Ms. Trump asserted in her own book</a>, earning a score that later helped him transfer to Wharton business school at the University of Pennsylvania, a credential he has boasted about ever since. (A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump has denied this, and the widow of a man with the name cited by Ms. Trump as the test-taking friend said that she was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/widow-trumps-friend-pushes-back-mary-trump-sat/story?id=71678433" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confident the assertion was false</a>.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>After graduating from Pennsylvania in 1968, however, the former military academy cadet had no interest in serving in the real military and risked being sent to fight in Vietnam. He managed to avoid the draft with a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels — a diagnosis that evidently was obtained as a favor from a podiatrist in Queens who rented his office from Mr. Trump’s father, Fred C. Trump. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html" title="">Two daughters of the podiatrist</a>, who died in 2007, have said that he often told them about saving the younger Mr. Trump from Vietnam as a courtesy to his landlord.</p><p>Freed from military obligations, Mr. Trump went into the family business, helping run his father’s empire of rental apartment buildings in the outer boroughs. Even in those early days, he came under suspicion of misconduct. In 1973, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html" title="">the Justice Department sued</a> the Trump family company for racial discrimination in renting apartments. Applications from Black applicants were marked C for “colored.” Mr. Trump fought the matter in court but ultimately agreed to a settlement that the Justice Department at the time called “one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated.”</p><p>His business career vaulted him to fame, and he had notable successes, perhaps most prominently the rehabilitation of the Commodore Hotel and the construction of Trump Tower. But he often reached further than he was able to deliver. His record in business was pockmarked with plenty of failures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J., was just one of Mr. Trump’s many business failures.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Makela for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/traveller/travel-news/trump-shuttle-looking-back-at-donald-trumps-failed-forgotten-airline-20201001-h1r3q8.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump Shuttle</a> airline?

He filed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/business/chapter-11-for-taj-mahal.html" title="">bankruptcy for the Taj Mahal</a> in 1991 and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/06/business/company-news-bankruptcy-dates-set-for-2-trump-casinos.html" title="">for the other two casinos</a> in 1992. He also filed bankruptcy in 1992 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/12/business/company-news-trump-s-plaza-hotel-bankruptcy-plan-approved.html" title="">for the Plaza Hotel</a>.</p><p>Even after recovering from that debacle, Mr. Trump failed again. His casino company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/business/trump-hotels-plans-to-seek-bankruptcy.html" title="">filed for bankruptcy in 2004</a> and then <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/trump-entertainment-files-for-chapter-11/" title="">again in 2009</a>, for his sixth trip into that process. In his various bankruptcies, he was compelled to sell assets, and creditors were forced to write off some of his debt. But Mr. Trump has boasted that he still made money in Atlantic City even after leaving a trail of losses for nearly everyone else involved, including workers who lost jobs.</p><p>Mr. Trump played the game along the edge, and sometimes over the line, of propriety. To grease his path, he would hire a <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/08/08/trump-hired-law-firm-where-cuomo-was-partner-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">governor’s son</a> or a federal prosecutor’s brother. Along the way, he was investigated time and time again. Federal, state and local authorities looked into <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his ties with the Mafia</a>, found <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-penalty-against-trump-taj-mahal-associates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">violations of money laundering laws</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/06/business/trump-to-pay-750000-fine.html" title="">penalized him for skirting stock trade rules</a>.</p><p>At one point when Mr. Trump was strapped for cash to make an interest payment, his father sent a lawyer to one of the son’s casinos to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-wealth-fred-trump.html" title="">buy $3.5 million in chips</a> without placing a bet. New Jersey’s casino regulators imposed a $65,000 fine for what amounted to an illegal loan.</p><p>But Mr. Trump makes a point of not admitting misdeeds or mistakes. Even his failures he portrays as triumphs. “I made a lot of money in Atlantic City,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-of-the-2015-gop-debate-9-pm/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he once said</a>, “and I’m very proud of it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p><h2 id="link-634e94b2">‘When You’re a Star’</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump in the control room of “The Apprentice” in New York in 2003.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>For years, Mr. Trump’s personal life was full of scandal, too, enough to make him a frequent topic of the gossip columns of the era. He did not mind.

He won many of those fights but lost or settled others.</p><p>His educational and philanthropic enterprises were also seen as shams.

The Senate ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html" title="">acquitted him again</a>, but this time seven Republicans voted for conviction and several others said they voted no only because he was already out of office by the time of the trial.</p><h2 id="link-4d029aa2">‘The Real Verdict’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-52"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump outside the New York State Supreme Court during his criminal trial in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><p>The explosive finale of the Trump presidency did not bring an end to the Trump scandals. On the contrary, it opened a new and unprecedented chapter in the epic and still-unresolved struggles between the 45th president and the American law enforcement system.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p>In the months after he departed the White House, authorities in Washington, New York, Georgia, Florida and Michigan opened investigations that ultimately led them to Mr. Trump. Civil lawsuits also mounted. Mr. Trump became a target or defendant in so many courthouses that his post-presidency has become a full-employment act for defense attorneys.</p><p>One after another, judges and juries found against Mr. Trump, branding him a fraudster, a sexual abuser and, through his real estate firm, a tax cheat. The two verdicts on behalf of E. Jean Carroll have left him on the hook for nearly $100 million including interest. The tax fraud conviction of the Trump Organization made him the first president to head a criminal company.</p><p>A separate civil lawsuit brought by the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, went to the heart of Mr. Trump’s self-image as a tycoon of Olympian proportions. Mr. Trump’s practice of valuing properties according to his needs came back to bite him when a judge found him liable for sweeping business fraud, ruling that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/nyregion/trump-fraud-trial-finances.html" title="">illegally inflated his net worth in securing loans</a>. The judge not only hit him with penalties that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/nyregion/trump-civil-fraud-trial-ruling.html" title="">could top $450 million</a>, he also barred Mr. Trump from leading any business in his original home state for three years. Mr. Trump is appealing.</p><p>While that judgment in itself was a first in presidential history, it barely seemed to register compared with the criminal cases brought against Mr. Trump. In what was then a stunning move, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/08/us/politics/trump-fbi-mar-a-lago.html" title="">F.B.I. conducted a search</a> of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to find classified documents that Mr. Trump took with him when he left the White House and then refused to give back even when subpoenaed. That, too, was a first.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-56"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photo provided by the Justice Department showing boxes of documents stored in a bathroom at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Department of Justice</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p>And then came what might have once been unthinkable — criminal charges against a former president. Mr. Trump was indicted not once, not twice, not three times but four times. While other presidents like Ulysses S. Grant, Warren G. Harding, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton were not without their own scandals, none of them were ever charged with felonies.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/nyregion/trump-indictment-hush-money-charges.html" title="">first indictment</a> centered on those hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels. Alvin L. Bragg, the district attorney for Manhattan, charged Mr. Trump with falsifying business records to cover up the affair and the payments. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/us/politics/trump-indictment-charges-documents-justice-department.html" title="">second indictment</a> came in federal court in Florida where the special counsel Jack Smith charged Mr. Trump with mishandling classified documents and obstructing authorities trying to retrieve them.</p><p>The third and fourth indictments both stemmed from Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election that he lost. Mr. Smith brought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/us/politics/trump-indicted-election-jan-6.html" title="">an election interference case</a> against him in federal court in Washington, while Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., brought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/15/us/trump-indictment-georgia" title="">a racketeering case</a> against Mr. Trump for trying to switch Georgia’s electoral votes. The Michigan attorney general, for her part, named Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/us/trump-michigan-election-interference.html" title="">an unindicted co-conspirator</a> in her own election case. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and blamed Democrats for coming after him for partisan reasons.</p><p>The drumbeat of hearings and appeals and procedural fights that have followed may have numbed the shock value, but these cases will stand out in those future history books. He has gone to trial on only one of the four indictments so far, Mr. Bragg’s hush-money case, and the jury unanimously found him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-convicted-hush-money-trial.html" title="">guilty of 34 felony counts</a>. Sentencing has been pushed off until after the election.</p><p>The other three cases are in various states of limbo in part because of aggressive and successful defense moves by Mr. Trump’s lawyers aimed at delaying or undercutting the charges against him. The Georgia case was sidetracked by revelations that Ms. Willis had a personal relationship with the prosecutor she chose to manage the case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/trump-document-case-dismissed.html" title="">Florida case was thrown out</a> in July by U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon, a Trump appointee, not because she found Mr. Trump innocent but because she considered Mr. Smith’s appointment as special counsel to be procedurally improper, a decision that stunned legal experts. Mr. Smith is appealing, and the charges could be reinstated.</p><p>The federal election case was thrown off track for months by Mr. Trump’s assertion that he had immunity as president. The Supreme Court largely accepted the argument, ruling for the first time in history that presidents have substantial <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity.html" title="">immunity for crimes related to official acts</a>. Now Judge Tanya S. Chutkan must determine whether Mr. Trump’s actions in trying to overturn the election to hold onto power constituted official acts, a process that could stretch out for months.</p><p>In the end, she may not get a chance. If Mr. Trump is elected next month, he could pull the plug on the federal prosecutions, and even the state cases in New York and Georgia may be frozen while he is in office again. He knows that, and he is counting on it. As he <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5119261/the-real-verdict-november-5th-people" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said earlier this year</a>, “The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5, by the people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-61"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump at a rally in New York last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
