    <h1>Biden Withdraws Proposed Regulations on Student Loans and Trans Athletes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Biden administration on Friday withdrew some of its main outstanding plans to enact significant federal student loan forgiveness and to set rules around the participation of transgender athletes on school sports teams.</p><p>The regulations were, at one time, among the administration’s top education policy priorities, and the decision to pull down the proposed regulations was a tacit acknowledgment that they would go nowhere under the administration of incoming President-elect Donald J. Trump.</p><p>Criticizing protections for transgender people was a central theme during Mr. Trump’s campaign, and he routinely attacked student debt reform.</p><p>But the move was also designed to insulate both policies against immediate manipulation by the incoming administration. The decision helped ensure that the open proposals could not be quickly rewritten, and that the Trump administration would have to at least start the process of introducing its own regulations from scratch.</p></div></div>
