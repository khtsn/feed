    <h1>Trump Suggests Restoring the State and Local Tax Break He Once Limited</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former President Donald J. Trump suggested on Tuesday that he would restore a deduction for state and local taxes, an expensive tax break that Mr. Trump and Republicans limited in a 2017 tax law.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, his social media website, Mr. Trump said he would “get SALT back, lower your Taxes, and so much more.”</p><p>Writing ahead of a campaign appearance on Long Island on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, which Republicans capped at $10,000 to offset the cost of the tax cuts they passed in 2017. For Americans living in high-tax and largely blue states like New York and New Jersey, the move has been deeply unpopular. Both Democrats and Republicans in those states have promised to restore the full deduction.</p><p>But allowing Americans to discount their state and local taxes fully from their federal tax bills would be costly. The Penn Wharton Budget Model puts the cost at roughly $1 trillion in decreased revenue over 10 years, and much of the tax benefit would flow to higher-income Americans who pay a lot in state and local tax.</p></div></div>
