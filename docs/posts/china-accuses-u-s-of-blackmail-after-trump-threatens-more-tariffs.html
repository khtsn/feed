It said that Beijing would take countermeasures to safeguard its interests.</p><p>“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmail nature of the United States,” the ministry’s statement said. “China will never accept it. If the United States insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”</p><p>China had announced last week that it would match Mr. Trump’s tariffs by imposing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/china-trump-tariffs-retaliation.html" title="">retaliatory 34 percent tax</a> on imports from America. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/economy/trump-china-tariffs-threat.html" title="">latest escalation</a> that Mr. Trump described on Monday, if imposed, could bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 104 percent. For some products, though, the rate is likely to be much higher because of levies that date back to Mr. Trump’s first term. Mr. Trump also threatened to halt any further negotiations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>American consumers last year bought $440 billion of goods from China, making it the second-largest source of U.S. imports after Mexico. Taken together, it could prove costly for American importers bringing in clothing, cellphones, chemicals and machinery from China.</p><p>China said that the United States should cancel all unilateral tariffs against China, “stop suppressing China’s economy and trade, and properly resolve differences with China through equal dialogue on the basis of mutual respect.”</p><p>China has been trying for months to engage in high-level talks with the Trump administration to try to lay the ground for a potential summit between Mr. Trump and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping. But despite Mr. Trump saying earlier this year that he was open to engaging with Mr. Xi, Beijing has struggled to receive much of a response from the White House.</p><p>Berry Wang<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Pierson covers Chinese foreign policy and China’s economic and cultural engagement with the world.
