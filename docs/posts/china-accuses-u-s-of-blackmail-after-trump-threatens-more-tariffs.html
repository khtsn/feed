    <h1>China Accuses U.S. of Blackmail After Trump Threatens More Tariffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>China lashed out at the United States on Tuesday after President Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114297331052690348" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demanded</a> that Beijing rescind its retaliatory tariffs or face an additional 50 percent U.S. levy, calling his threat “blackmail,” as tensions between the two major powers rose.</p><p>The Ministry of Commerce, without referring to the American president by name, said that Beijing had noted that the United States had threatened to impose a further 50 percent tariff on China. It said that Beijing would take countermeasures to safeguard its interests.</p><p>“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmail nature of the United States,” the ministry’s statement said. “China will never accept it. If the United States insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”</p><p>China had announced last week that it would match Mr. Trump’s tariffs by imposing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/china-trump-tariffs-retaliation.html" title="">retaliatory 34 percent tax</a> on imports from America. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/economy/trump-china-tariffs-threat.html" title="">latest escalation</a> that Mr. Trump described on Monday, if imposed, could bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 104 percent. For some products, though, the rate is likely to be much higher because of levies that date back to Mr. Trump’s first term. Mr. Trump also threatened to halt any further negotiations.</p></div></div>
