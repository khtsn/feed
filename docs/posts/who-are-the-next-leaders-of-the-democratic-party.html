Win, and everything is great. Lose, and your party is rudderless, leaderless and powerless.</p><p>So it goes for the Democrats after Vice President Kamala Harris’s defeat to former President Donald J. Trump. Questions about who will lead the party, and in what direction, will be hotly debated as officials explore what went wrong and forge plans to oppose the next Trump administration.</p><p>Jockeying has already begun, and not all ambition may be rewarded. Appearing too eager to seize the opportunity presented by Ms. Harris’s defeat could backfire if Democrats are not ready to move forward. But if the period after the 2016 election is any guide, scores of Democratic figures and groups will try to fill the leadership void created as President Biden leaves office.</p><p>Four years is a very long time in politics. In that time, Barack Obama went from a state senator to a presidential nominee. In even less time than that, Mr. Trump transformed from being a reality show figure pushing a racist lie about Mr. Obama to president himself. It is not out of the question that the Democrats’ next leader is not someone on the nation’s radar today.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>With those caveats, here’s a look at six groups of people who could determine which direction Democrats take as the second Trump administration unfolds.</p><h2 id="link-1ea7953a">Kamala Harris and Tim Walz</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris and Gov.

Until Ms. Harris says otherwise, she remains a top leader in her party, has control of its largest donor list, and maintains generally good relations with a wide array of supporters.</p><p>On the other hand, she ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html" title="">a poor presidential campaign</a> during the 2020 race, and Mr. Trump swept her in every battleground state this year. If she wanted to run again, she would probably need to win over skeptical Democrats with impressive showings in mainstream news interviews and town-hall events — forums where her performances this year were often cautious or halting.</p><p>Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, unlike Ms. Harris, has a day job to return to. He goes back to his state as a national figure — though he will lack the unified Democratic control of the State Legislature he enjoyed for the last two years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There is little question that Mr. Walz’s ambition extends beyond Minnesota. Though he failed to stem Ms. Harris’s losses in rural areas, he remains well liked by fellow Democratic governors and former congressional colleagues. During <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/elections/tim-walz-kamala-harris-election.html" title="">a concession speech on Friday in Minnesota</a>, he signaled that he was eager to remain relevant in the party.</p><p>“Get back in this fight when you’re ready,” he said. “And know that, whenever you’re ready to get back in that fight, I’ll be standing right here, ready to fight the fight with you.”</p><h2 id="link-5ff1ab47">Ambitious governors</h2><p>Democrats have a deep bench of governors who are widely seen as influential party leaders.</p><p>They include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/opinion/democratic-party-future-kentucky.html" title="">Andy Beshear of Kentucky</a>, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Wes Moore of Maryland, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Gavin Newsom of California, JB Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, among others.</p><p>Mr. Murphy is among the potential candidates to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee who are now having discussions about running for that post. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/newsom-trump-california.html" title="">Mr. Newsom and Mr. Pritzker on Friday</a> began the process of putting forward legislation to codify anti-Trump measures into their state laws.</p><p>Mr. Shapiro, who was a finalist to become Ms. Harris’s running mate and emerged politically unscathed from this year’s election, remains focused on the needs of Pennsylvanians, according to a spokesman. That was evidenced by his aides on Monday promoting <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/business/2024/11/package-manufacturer-to-build-107000-square-foot-facility-in-central-pa-with-states-assistance.html?outputType=amp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a local news story</a> about at least 64 new jobs in a county where Mr. Trump won two-thirds of the vote last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Pritzker is also taking in the new political landscape. </p><p>“When you’re not in the Oval Office anymore and your party’s not in the Oval Office anymore, the focus and the locus of power moves and it gets spread out,” he said in an interview on Monday. “I’m not going to tell you where it will land or what I think, because I don’t know.”</p><h2 id="link-3a633bc5">Biden cabinet members</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, has been highly visible on television, and is often dispatched to explain Democratic positions on Fox News.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Pete Buttigieg, Mr. Biden’s transportation secretary, and Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, are longtime favorites of Democratic donors, and they both spent a lot of time — in their “personal capacity,” of course — stumping for Mr. Biden and then for Ms. Harris.</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg remains one of the party’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/magazine/pete-buttigieg-interview-election-democrats.html" title="">most gifted communicators</a>, particularly on television, where he was often dispatched to explain its policies and positions on Fox News, an assignment many fellow Democrats declined.</p><p>Ms. Raimondo, a former Rhode Island governor, was seen as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/26/business/economy/gina-raimondo-chips-biden.html" title="">a rising star in the Biden cabinet</a>, but she is far better known in Washington circles and by donors than among the party’s base.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Greg Casar of Texas is expected to succeed Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>On the other hand, the candidate who did the best with young voters in the last two competitive Democratic primary contests was Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who was just re-elected at 83 years old.</p><p>Mr. Sanders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/democrats-kamala-harris.html" title="">very much wants to steer the party</a> toward his vision of politics, which is at odds with the donor and corporate interests that often rule the day, even if his age means he has run his last national election. A spokeswoman for Mr. Sanders said he intended to remain involved in guiding the party’s direction but declined to speculate on his future plans.</p><p>Other liberals who fit roughly into the Sanders milieu include Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ro Khanna of California and Pramila Jayapal of Washington State and Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.</p><p>One other name to expect to hear a lot more from next year is Representative Greg Casar of Texas, who is expected to succeed Ms. Jayapal as chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.</p><p>“Progressives in Congress the next two years really need to focus on pushing popular economic issues where liberals, conservatives and independent Americans agree with us over people like Donald Trump,” Mr. Casar said in an interview last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-559b9888">Celebrities, billionaires and other fantasy candidates</h2><p>When Mr. Trump won in 2016, Democrats floated all manner of celebrities and ultrawealthy people as possible presidential contenders.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/oprah-president-2020.html" title="">Oprah Winfrey candidacy</a> was the dream for the party. Mark Zuckerberg had onetime aides to Mr. Obama <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-hits-the-road-to-meet-regular-folkswith-a-few-conditions-1499873098" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrange a private tour of the country</a>. The billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael R. Bloomberg spent many millions to run for president in the 2020 race, efforts that paid off handsomely for their consultants but hardly for the candidates.</p><p>This time, there will undoubtedly be new calls for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/harris-michelle-obama-michigan.html" title="">Michelle Obama</a> to become more vocal in the party. Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks chief executive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/us/politics/howard-schultz-drops-out-2020.html" title="">considered running for president as an independent candidate in 2020</a>.</p><p>The billionaire Mark Cuban, who was an energetic supporter of Ms. Harris on the campaign trail, has previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/business/dealbook/100000005544274/mark-cuban-president.html" title="">expressed interest</a> in running himself.</p><p>The country might even hear again about presidential ambitions from the actor Dwayne Johnson, better known as The Rock, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/arts/television/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-president.html" title="">in 2017 suggested he was interested</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
