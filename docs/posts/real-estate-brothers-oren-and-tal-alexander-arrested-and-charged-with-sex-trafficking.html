The twins also face separate state felony charges of sexual battery connected to three separate assaults, according to arrest warrants obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>Until this summer, Oren and Tal were among the biggest names in real estate in New York and Miami, and their sales and moves were chronicled in the tabloids. They reached the top ranks at Douglas Elliman, one of the largest real estate brokerages in the country, and helped broker the sale of a nearly $240 million penthouse — at the time, the most expensive residential sale in U.S. history. They then co-founded their own real estate brokerage, Official. Alon Alexander did not work in real estate, but he socialized with them.</p><p>According to the federal indictment, the three brothers had conspired in the sex trafficking scheme since at least 2010. Coordinating with other men, they arranged events and domestic and international trips as bait to recruit, entice and transport women, whom they later raped, the indictment says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The federal charges were announced Wednesday afternoon in Manhattan by Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and James E. Dennehy, the head of the F.B.I.’s New York office. The top state prosecutor in Miami, Katherine Fernández Rundle, also announced the state charges.</p><p>“Our investigation is far from over,” Mr. Williams said in a statement, urging anyone with claims of sexual violence by any of the Alexander brothers to come forward.</p><p>Ms. Rundle said at the news conference in Miami, “Time and again, we’ve seen people who use their fame, their money, their power to create opportunities to commit sexual crimes.”</p><p>Susan Necheles, a lawyer for Oren Alexander, had no comment on the charges. Isabelle Kirshner, a lawyer for Alon Alexander, and Deanna Paul, a lawyer for Tal Alexander, also had no comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-3"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/11/nyregion/alexander-indictment.html"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/61ca2f07bcf158ca/1/output-1.png" alt="Thumbnail of page 1"/></a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to the indictment, the Alexander brothers used social connections or the guise of starting a relationship to entice women to meet. On multiple occasions, the indictment says, the brothers — alone or together — then sexually assaulted the women, sometimes within hours of their meeting.</p><p>“At times, the defendants physically restrained and held down their victims during the rapes and sexual assaults and ignored screams and explicit requests to stop,” the indictment says.</p><p>Immediately after the sexual assaults, it says, the brothers sometimes offered their victims concert tickets, travel and other luxury experiences.</p><p>The indictment charges that the brothers also procured drugs that they agreed to provide the women, including cocaine, mushrooms and GHB, a so-called date-rape drug that causes loss of consciousness and memory.</p><p>Frequently, the brothers and others “surreptitiously drugged women’s drinks,” the indictment says.</p><p>“Some of the victims experienced symptoms of impaired physical and mental capacity, including limitations of movement and speech and incomplete memories of events,” it says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In addition to the assaults during planned trips and events, the indictment added, the brothers frequently drugged and raped or sexually assaulted women they encountered by chance, including women they met at bars and nightclubs and on dating apps.</p><p>All three brothers were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and a separate count of sex trafficking of one woman by force, fraud or coercion; she was identified only as Victim-2. In addition, Tal Alexander was charged with the sex trafficking of a second victim, identified as Victim-1.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Oren Alexander, right, and his twin brother, Alon, were fixtures of the nightlife scene in both Miami and New York for years.

Caproni. Multiple women interviewed by the government reported being raped by at least one of the brothers in the early 2000s, including some who were raped by groups of boys, including the brothers, the letter says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Each of the victims that the government has interviewed from this period reported hearing that individuals involved — including Tal Alexander — talked about the assaults at school, boasting about ‘running train’ on their victims and saying they wanted to ‘do it again,’” the prosecutors wrote.</p><p>“Oren bragged about doing so in his high school yearbook — writing that ‘riding my first “choo choo” train’ was his most memorable moment from high school,” the prosecutors wrote.</p><p>As adults, the prosecutors added, the brothers’ serial sexual violence only escalated, along with attempts to cover it up, the government wrote.</p><p>The Florida arrest warrants against Oren and Alon Alexander include details of three sexual assaults, in 2016, 2017 and 2021. All three incidents involve Oren Alexander; only the 2016 incident involves Alon Alexander. In that incident, the twins face a charge of sexual battery by multiple perpetrators.</p><p>In 2016, according to the warrants, Alon Alexander invited a woman in New York to a barbecue in a Miami Beach condo, but when she arrived, she was the only guest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Alon Alexander gave the woman a tour of the condo and led her to the bedroom, the woman later told the Miami Beach Police Department. The woman said that Alon Alexander and Oren Alexander sexually assaulted her and that a cousin, Ohad Fisherman, helped hold her down. Mr. Fisherman, 39, who also faces a sexual battery charge, remains at large.</p><p>In 2017, another woman said that Oren Alexander messaged her on Instagram and that she later met him, Alon Alexander and other family members.</p><p>She later told the police that Oren Alexander had assaulted her in the same Miami Beach condo.</p><p>In the weeks later, she said, she saw Oren Alexander again and asked for an apology. He tried to kiss her and then masturbated over her, she told the police.</p><p>The woman told friends about what happened and Oren Alexander got wind of it, according to the warrant, and in 2018, he sent her a text message saying: “Nothing happened. If you keep talking about it, I’m going to ruin you.”</p><p>The 2021 incident involved a woman who told the police that she had met Oren Alexander at dinner with a friend and later went to a Miami Beach house with him. Oren Alexander led her into a bedroom, where he kissed her and then ripped her dress, according to the warrant. She tried to leave, but was unable to, and he assaulted her, the warrant says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Tal and Oren Alexander’s reign as real estate princes came to an abrupt end in June when <a href="https://therealdeal.com/national/2024/06/08/lawsuits-accuse-top-broker-oren-alexander-twin-brother-alon-of-rape/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Real Deal, a real estate trade publication, first reported</a> that women had filed lawsuits that claimed they were sexually assaulted by the brothers.</p><p>Two women sued Oren and Alon Alexander for assault; a third woman sued the twins along with Tal. In the wake of those suits, dozens of other women came forward with allegations of assault against the brothers, including in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/realestate/tal-oren-alexander-sexual-assault.html" title="">The Times</a>.</p><p>Those women included Tracy Tutor, a top broker at Douglas Elliman Beverly Hills and one of the stars of the reality TV show “Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles.” Seven of the women who spoke to The Times said they believed they had been drugged, describing a fog that erased or clouded their memory.</p><p>Olivia Bensimon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/benjamin-weiser">More about Benjamin Weiser</a></span></p></div><div><p>Debra Kamin reports on real estate, covering what it means to buy, sell and own a home in America today.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/debra-kamin">More about Debra Kamin</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
