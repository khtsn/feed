The deal would make OpenAI one of the most valuable private companies in the world, along with the rocket company SpaceX and ByteDance, the maker of TikTok.</p><p>SoftBank will invest up to $40 billion in OpenAI and will syndicate the deal, with other investors providing about a quarter of the total funds, the people said. That figure would be a $15 billion increase from a total that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/technology/softbank-openai-ai-investment.html" title="">discussed one week ago</a>.</p><p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/07/softbank-set-to-invest-40-billion-in-openai-at-260-billion-valuation-sources-say.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported earlier</a> on the investment talks.</p><p>The deal shows that investors are still bullish on artificial intelligence market leaders like OpenAI, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html" title="">the U.S. financial markets’ tumbling late last month</a> after a Chinese company called DeepSeek unveiled rival technology.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In December, DeepSeek said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html" title="">built one of the world’s most powerful A.I. systems</a> using <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html" title="">far fewer computer chips than many experts thought possible</a>. The prevailing wisdom had been that only companies like OpenAI — which spent tens of billions of dollars training their A.I. technologies using tens of thousands of specialized chips — could build the most powerful systems.</p><p>DeepSeek built its technology with only 2,000 chips and spent only about $6 million in raw computing power.</p><p>But many in the field believe that the companies with access to the most computing power will continue to lead the market. Late last month, OpenAI and SoftBank joined Oracle in an agreement to spend $100 billion erecting new computer data centers in the United States that will be used to build A.I. President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/technology/trump-openai-stargate-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">announced the deal</a> on his second day in office.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.
