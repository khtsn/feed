data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>In June, two NASA astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, set out for what was expected to be an eight-day trip to the International Space Station.</p><p>On Wednesday — around six months and several spacecraft malfunctions later — they donned Santa Claus hats and wished their families the best from hundreds of miles above sea level as their tenure, which is likely to keep them in Earth’s orbit for at least two more months, stretched on.</p><p>Ms. Williams, 59, and Mr. Wilmore, 61, docked at the space station during a test flight of Boeing’s Starliner, which was intended to be a commercial option for ferrying people to and from the station.</p><p>But after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html" title="">spate of malfunctions</a> called the safety of the return flight into question, NASA leaders decided to bring the Starliner to Earth uncrewed, leaving the two astronauts behind until another spacecraft can take them back.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>So Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore had a chance to participate in the long, strange tradition of celebrating the holidays in space, which began in 1968 when the Apollo 8 astronauts read verses from the Book of Genesis while broadcasting a video of the lunar surface to roughly one billion viewers.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div

crew members, were spending the holidays “enjoying the view of Earth” and “privately communicating with their families” via video call and email.</p><p>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore both celebrate Christmas, the spokesman said, but former I.S.S. astronauts have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlTJM7Yb344" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filmed dreidels spinning endlessly</a> in zero gravity and fashioned <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3198100310494925" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">felt menorahs</a>.</p><p>In between their responsibilities in the station, the current crew also made time to cobble together a makeshift reindeer out of spare stowage bags (the body) and brown industrial clips (yes, the antlers). The creation recalls a Christmas tree that astronauts in 1973 made with leftover food containers and cardboard cutouts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The current I.S.S. crew also staged a cookie-decorating contest with the staff at Mission Control Center in Houston. The astronauts had an unfair advantage: zero gravity.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It opened up a whole new dimension, quite literally, with layer upon layer of icing,” Nick Hague, a NASA astronaut at the station, <a href="https://x.com/AstroHague/status/1872306743893807283/photo/3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted on social media</a>.</p><p>Mr. Hague arrived at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/science/spacex-launch-nasa.html" title="">space station in September</a> aboard a SpaceX rocket with two empty seats, which are reserved to bring Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html" title="">back to Earth</a> <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/12/17/nasa-adjusts-crew-10-launch-date/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">next year</a>.</p><p>For Christmas dinner, the astronauts sat down to special, prepackaged holiday foods, including turkey, ham, green beans and casseroles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A recent resupply mission — in which 6,000 pounds of supplies were rocketed from Florida to the I.S.S. — included a package labeled “Holiday Bulk Overwrap Bag” that apparently held lobster, crab and quail.</p><p>On Wednesday, a NASA spokesman could not confirm whether any of the items were on the holiday dinner menu.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLyb8BhafE&amp;t=11s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keeping with tradition</a>, the astronauts recorded a holiday message to Earth, this time with candy canes floating across the video screen.</p><p>“The holiday season is about spending time with friends and family and loved ones,” Mr. Hague said. “This year, we’re going to be in orbit, away from them. We want to send our heartfelt Merry Christmas, and we hope you have a wonderful holiday.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Teddy Rosenbluth is a health reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-aeronautics-and-space-administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/26/science/iss-astronauts-holiday-celebration.html">17</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other 2024 event that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/01/01/science/astronomy-space-calendar">our space and </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2024/01/01/science/astronomy-space-calendar">astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>New findings suggest that an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/science/sun-superflares-stars.html">extraordinarily powerful and dangerous burst of radiation</a> might flare from our sun in the future.</p></li><li><p>We might finally understand what’s going on inside Uranus and Neptune, and the answer is pretty surprising: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/science/uranus-neptune-oceans.html">They may each contain an ocean of water</a>.</p></li><li><p>Using supercomputer-powered simulations, scientists showed that an asteroid’s destruction may have given Mars rings, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/science/mars-moons-asteroids-rings.html">then its two small moons</a>.</p></li><li><p>Is Pluto a planet?
