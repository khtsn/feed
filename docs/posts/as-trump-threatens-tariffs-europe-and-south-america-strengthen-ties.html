data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The European Union reached a major trade deal on Friday with five South American countries, concluding a long-delayed negotiation that took on new urgency as President-elect Donald J. Trump threatens to impose tariffs on some of the world’s largest economies.</p><p>The deal, between the European Union and members of Mercosur — a bloc that includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — would establish one of the largest trade zones in the world, and would be the European Union’s biggest trade agreement ever.</p><p>With European leaders preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump’s return to office will lead to a more fragmented global economy, the deal is a significant victory for proponents of free trade, linking markets with 780 million people. But it could fuel frustration within the European bloc, with France opposed to the agreement over concerns about dumping cheap agricultural imports in Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-1"><div><h3>Here’s what you need to know:</h3><ul><li><a href="#link-592878a4">What’s in the trade deal?</a></li><li><a href="#link-5d16fd83">A boon for European carmakers and others.</a></li><li><a href="#link-48cac3df">France opposes the deal out of concern for farmers.</a></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-592878a4">What’s in the trade deal?</h2><p>If ratified, the agreement would lift tariffs on products including meat, cars, wine and chocolate. A date for the ratification vote has not yet been set. France has strongly opposed the agreement, but Paris does not appear to have persuaded enough other European countries to vote against it.</p><p>With Mr. Trump’s election, Europe is facing the threat of high tariffs on exports to the United States, its biggest trading partner, and increased competition from China. Mr. Trump has suggested that he would impose tariffs of 10 to 20 percent on products around the world and tariffs of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods.</p><p>So European leaders have emphasized the need to diversify trade.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said on Friday that the political agreement was a milestone for Europe and South America.</p><p>“We both believe that openness and cooperation are the true engines of progress and prosperity,” she said, speaking in Uruguay. “I know that strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, towards isolation and fragmentation, but this agreement is our clear response.”</p><p>Negotiations over the trade deal began 25 years ago and came close to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/world/americas/eu-four-latin-american-nations-trade-deal.html" title="">a breakthrough in 2019</a>. Ms. von der Leyen said the agreement would save European companies 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in export duties per year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The prospect of tariffs has also made the deal more compelling for the members of Mercosur, who are interested in selling more beef and industrial products to Europe. China’s intention to increase agricultural production means that a major buyer of Argentine and Brazilian meat and soybeans could reduce purchases.</p><p>Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow in Brussels at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the deal came at a critical moment. “The signal is that, well, the United States may be pulling out of the global trading system, but the rest of the world is intent on pursuing a different route,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-5d16fd83">A boon for European carmakers and others.</h2><p>Economists say the agreement is critical for Europe, which is facing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/business/economy/europe-economy-donald-trump.html" title="">disappointing economic outlook</a>, and particularly for Germany, the biggest exporter to the Mercosur region. Tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump would exacerbate challenges for major European industries, including the automobile, pharmaceutical and machinery sectors.</p><p>European carmakers, including BMW, Fiat, Peugeot and Volkswagen, would benefit from lower tariffs on imports and exports between the two blocs. Novartis, Sanofi and other European pharmaceutical giants would gain easier access to a large market for health care products.</p><p>A range of other European industries, such as the luxury sector, tech, construction and banking, would also be able to reach hundreds of millions of consumers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Spain, one of the deal’s biggest backers, manufactures large quantities of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The Spanish government said an agreement would increase exports by up to 40 percent and create an estimated 22,000 jobs.</p><p>Even if Europe were spared from U.S. tariffs, escalating tension between the United States and China could pose problems for European companies. Business leaders are concerned that if Chinese products are shut out of U.S. markets, a surge of cheap Chinese imports would instead enter Europe or other markets where Europe competes.</p><p>Europe needs to prioritize not only the ratification of the South America trade agreement, but also trade agreements with other countries and regions, like Britain and Switzerland and nations in the Indo-Pacific region, said Ignacio García Bercero, a former European Commission trade official. The European bloc already has <a href="https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/mercosur/eu-mercosur-agreement/agreement-explained_en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trade deals</a> with most other countries in South America.</p><p>South America is also a reservoir of raw materials like lithium, nickel and manganese that are needed for Europe’s transition to green energy.</p><h2 id="link-48cac3df">France opposes the deal out of concern for farmers.</h2><p>France has bitterly opposed the pact, saying it would open Europe’s agricultural markets to cheap food imports, including beef and wheat, that use hormones and pesticides that are forbidden in Europe. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/31/world/europe/angry-farmers-are-reshaping-europe.html" title="">French farmers</a>, a politically powerful lobby, have joined others across the bloc to denounce what they fear will amount to food dumping that risks their economic survival.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The timing is precarious for Emmanuel Macron, the embattled president of France, whose government is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html" title="">mired in crisis</a>. He has called the agreement “unacceptable.”</p><p>Environmental groups also oppose the deal, saying it would accelerate the destruction of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/24/world/europe/climate-brazil-europe-trump-g7.html" title="">forests in the Amazon</a> to make way for increased agricultural production.</p><p>Ms. von der Leyen’s decision to push through the deal without Mr. Macron’s approval could fuel suspicion in France about giving Brussels too much power and could spur <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/europe/france-barnier-prime-minister-le-pen.html" title="">support for Marine Le Pen</a>, a nationalist, anti-immigrant leader who also opposes the deal.</p><p>“It’s a bit of a tinder box,” Mr. Kirkegaard said. “The deal will remind many French voters that they don’t have much influence in the E.U. anymore.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-10"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jenny Gross is a reporter for The Times covering Europe and other topics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jenny-gross">More about Jenny Gross</a></span></p></div><div><p>Liz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about economic, social and policy developments around Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liz-alderman">More about Liz Alderman</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Patricia Cohen writes about global economics and is based in London.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patricia-cohen">More about Patricia Cohen</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/european-union">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/mercosur">Mercosur</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/ursula-von-der-leyen">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/06/world/europe/eu-trade-deal-mercosur-latin-america.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/12/06/world/europe/eu-trade-deal-mercosur-latin-america.html">0</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
