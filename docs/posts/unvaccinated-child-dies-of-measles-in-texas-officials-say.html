    <h1>Unvaccinated Child Dies of Measles in Texas, Officials Say</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life-threatening to anyone who is not protected against the virus.</p><p>Doctors say the best way to protect against the disease is with two doses of a vaccine, which is usually administered to children as a combination measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine prevent more than 97 percent of measles infections, according to Texas health officials.</p><p>The South Plains region of Texas, where the outbreak has been spreading, has <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vaccination rates</a> that lag significantly behind federal targets.</p><p>New Mexico has also <a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported an outbreak</a>, with nine cases in Lea County, in the southeastern part of the state, on the Texas border. Four of those cases are children under the age of 18, all of whom are unvaccinated, according to Robert Nott, a spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Health. None of the cases in New Mexico have led to hospitalizations, he said.</p><p>The outbreak comes amid growing concerns among public health experts about declining vaccination rates and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/rfk-jr-hhs-senate-confirmation.html" title="">the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, a prominent vaccine skeptic, as the nationâ€™s health secretary.</p></div></div>
