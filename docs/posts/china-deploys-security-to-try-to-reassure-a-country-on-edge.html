Police officers have increased patrols in supermarkets, tourist attractions and other crowded places, and pledged to better regulate knives and other weapons. Officials have also promised to help the unemployed and distribute holiday subsidies to the needy.</p><p>The security push, which the authorities in some places have labeled “Operation Winter,” follows a string of recent attacks that put a renewed spotlight on China’s struggling economy. In November, a driver plowed into a crowd outside a sports center in the city of Zhuhai, killing at least 35 people in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/asia/china-car-zhuhai-ramming.html" title="">China’s deadliest attack in a decade</a>. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/world/asia/wuxi-china-stabbing.html" title="">stabbing that killed eight people</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/asia/china-school-car-ramming.html" title="">another car ramming outside a school</a>, followed barely a week afterward. In all three cases, officials said the perpetrators were venting financial dissatisfactions.</p><p>After the Zhuhai attack, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, ordered officials to “strictly prevent extreme cases.” The authorities at all levels have raced to comply.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The drivers in the two car attacks were sentenced to death late last month, in unusually speedy trials that showed the government’s determination to crack down on possible copycats.</p><p>Projecting stability and control has long been one of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s biggest preoccupations, its implicit justification for limiting citizens’ civil liberties. But that preoccupation has become even more central as high youth unemployment, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/business/china-foreclosures-mortgages.html" title="">soaring foreclosures</a> and deteriorating international relations have fueled widespread anxiety about China’s future. Some government workers have gone unpaid, as local governments’ finances stagnate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A police officer at the site of a deadly car attack in Zhuhai, in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tingshu Wang/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Public protests, mostly related to economic issues such as investment losses or unpaid wages, grew by 18 percent in the first 11 months of 2024, compared to the year before, according to a tracker by Freedom House, a Washington-based advocacy group.</p><p>But Beijing has remained reluctant to strengthen the country’s social safety net or offer substantial direct relief to consumers.

But this year, the instructions on social stability were more detailed. They singled out venues to keep an eye on — including campuses and sports venues — and called on officials to monitor public opinion and provide “positive guidance.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Discussion about the attacks, and about economic discontent in general, has been heavily censored.

The authorities have at times acknowledged those demands, such as in their promises to combat wage arrears for migrant workers, or provide holiday handouts to homeless people or people with disabilities.</p><p>This month, many civil servants across the country discovered that they had been given a surprise pay raise, according to discussion on social media, though the government did not issue any formal announcement.</p><p>Yet many calls for more substantive reforms have been censored, themselves deemed threats to social stability.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“They should have been looking for what forces turned these people into beasts, but instead they ran off to investigate the ‘five types of losers,’” Li Chengpeng, a former prominent Chinese journalist now living overseas, <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/714604.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>. He was referring to local government notices that circulated online directing officials to surveil people who had suffered losses, such as of jobs or investments.</p><p>Still, the same economic downturn that may be fueling some people’s grievances may also make it difficult to sustain the heightened security measures.</p><p>Many local governments are already swimming in debt. They are under intense pressure now to answer Mr. Xi’s call to prevent mass incidents, but their money and manpower will soon come under strain, said <a href="https://hongshenzhu.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hongshen Zhu</a>, an assistant professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who studies Chinese governance.</p><p>“As long as no new incidents occur, the priority of public safety will drop for local governments until the next public outcry happens,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Wang is a China correspondent based in Beijing, where she writes about how the country’s global rise and ambitions are shaping the daily lives of its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vivian-wang">More about Vivian Wang</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
