Give us what you stole from us.”</p><p>As security guards hustled Ms. Thorpe out of the chamber, she continued to heckle the king, demanding that Britain enter a treaty with Australia’s Indigenous population and accusing British colonizers of genocide.</p><p>“Our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,” said Ms. Thorpe, wearing a traditional possum skin cloak and shaking her fist at Charles, as the guards backed her toward the door. “You destroyed our land.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Once out of the room, Ms. Thorpe could be heard shouting an epithet about the British “colony” in Australia.

Ms. Thorpe, who comes from a prominent family of Indigenous activists, has long campaigned for Aboriginal rights and against the British monarchy.</p><p>In 2022, when she was swearing her oath of office after having been re-elected to the federal senate, she raised her fist in a Black power salute and referred to the then-queen as “the colonizing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.” She was instructed to repeat the oath and did so in a tone of open mockery.</p><p>Buckingham Palace had no response to the incident on Monday. An official at the palace, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “Their majesties are deeply grateful to the very many thousands who turned out to support them, and are only sorry they didn’t have a chance to stop and talk to every single one. The warmth and scale of the reception was truly awesome.”</p><p>For Charles, the trip to Australia is his most ambitious foreign travel since the palace confirmed in February that he had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/world/europe/king-charles-cancer.html" title="">diagnosed with cancer</a>. The king’s itinerary has been shaped to give him plenty of time for rest and recuperation: After arriving in Sydney on Friday evening, Charles and Camilla took a day off on Saturday, before attending a church service on Sunday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The king will travel on to Samoa later in the week for a meeting of the heads of government of the Commonwealth. There, he may face further backlash from Britain’s colonial legacy. Caribbean leaders are expected to renew calls for Britain to pay reparations for its colonial-era role in the slave trade, as well as for damage caused to the islands from climate change.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
