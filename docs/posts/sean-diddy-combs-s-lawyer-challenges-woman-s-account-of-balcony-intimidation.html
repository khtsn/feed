She testified that Mr. Combs entered the apartment in a rage, lifted her up onto the railing and threw her down onto the balcony furniture, which she said caused bruising, persistent nightmares and paranoia.</p><p>Her allegation is part of what prosecutors have described as a pattern of violence perpetrated by Mr. Combs over years — a pattern that they say intimidated Ms. Ventura into following his sexual demands.</p><p>One of Mr. Combs’s lawyers, Nicole Westmoreland, resumed her vigorous questioning of Ms. Bongolan on Thursday, pointing to discrepancies between Ms. Bongolan’s testimony at the trial and previous accounts she gave in government interviews, legal letters and a civil suit that she filed against Mr. Combs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Combs is facing sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers have acknowledged that Mr. Combs had a problem with violence, but they have denied that he coerced anyone into sex.</p><p>On Thursday, a second woman who prosecutors say was sex trafficked by Mr. Combs is expected to take the stand in what prosecutors projected would be several days of testimony about drug-fueled sex marathons with male prostitutes known as “freak-offs.”</p><p>A judge has allowed the woman to testify anonymously, and she is being referred to in court by the pseudonym “Jane.” She is the most significant witness since Ms. Ventura, whose allegations of physical and sexual abuse gave rise to the criminal case.</p><p>Prosecutors have said that Jane’s relationship with Mr. Combs mirrored the one he had with Ms. Ventura in many ways. Like Ms. Ventura, they have said, Jane was coerced into freak-offs through violence, financial control and threats related to videos of the sexual encounters, which they said Mr. Combs directed step by step.</p><p>Unlike Ms. Ventura, who is a singer known as Cassie and a public celebrity, Jane’s identity has not been revealed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The government has described Jane as a single mother who started spending time with Mr. Combs in 2020 and quickly fell in love with the music mogul, agreeing to participate in an initial freak-off to please him.</p><p>“Jane thought the first freak-off was a one-time, wild night,” Emily A. Johnson, one of the prosecutors, said at the start of the case. “Jane was wrong.”</p><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers have argued at trial that Ms. Ventura and Jane were willing participants in the freak-offs. </p><p>At the start of the trial, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, described Jane’s relationship with Mr. Combs as “toxic and dysfunctional” but said “the evidence is going to show you that she is a capable, strong woman who willingly engaged in their sex life so they could spend time together.”</p><p>“That is simply not sex trafficking,” she added.</p><p>The government did not secure Jane’s cooperation in the case until after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">Mr. Combs was arrested</a> in September. Prosecutors noted in court papers that Mr. Combs had been depositing payments into her bank account as recently as that month. She began meeting with prosecutors in January.</p><p>Her relationship with Mr. Combs overlaps with the criminal investigation into his conduct: One of the key violent outbursts preceding a freak-off that prosecutors have cited occurred less than a year from the start of the trial.</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
