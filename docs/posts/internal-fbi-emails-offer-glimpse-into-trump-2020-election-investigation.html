    <h1>Internal FBI Emails Offer Glimpse Into Trump 2020 Election Investigation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the emails, dated March 22, 2022, contained a formal request by F.B.I. agents to open the investigation into Mr. Trump, which was code-named “Arctic Frost.” That request, which was made public for the first time by the committee, asserted that the inquiry should be started based on evidence, including statements made by three lawyers — John Eastman, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Boris Epshteyn — all of whom played a role in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/fake-electors-explained-trump-jan-6.html" title="">the fake electors scheme</a>.</p><p>That scheme was arguably the longest-running and the most expansive of the multiple efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the election. Evidence about it was ultimately used by the special counsel, Jack Smith, in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/us/politics/trump-indicted-election-jan-6.html" title="">indictment he filed in August 2023</a> accusing Mr. Trump of three intersecting conspiracies to disrupt the lawful transfer of power to his opponent in the 2020 race, Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>The request by the F.B.I. to open the Trump investigation shed new light on the timeline of the inquiry. It said, for instance, that a grand jury sitting in Federal District Court in Washington began hearing evidence about Mr. Trump’s attempts to overturn the election on Jan. 31, 2022 and that the lead federal prosecutor on the case, Thomas P. Windom, had agreed slightly more than two weeks later with the F.B.I.’s assessment to open a full investigation.</p><p>The inquiry formally began on April 13, 2022, when the deputy director of the F.B.I., Paul Abbate, signed the request, according to another email released by the committee on Thursday.</p><p>“Arctic Frost Open,” the subject line read.</p><p>The fake electors scheme involved dozens of Republican officials who created slates of electors claiming that Mr. Trump won in seven crucial states that he actually lost. It culminated in a campaign to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to use the false slates to subvert congressional certification of the outcome on Jan. 6, 2021 — and in the violent attack on the Capitol that unfolded as he refused to do so.</p></div></div>
