Ana Barbosu, a Romanian gymnast, appeared to place third in the floor event finals of the artistic gymnastics competition and prematurely celebrated her victory. Moments later, she wept as another gymnast moved into bronze medal position.</p><p>Jordan Chiles, Barbosu’s American competitor, initially appeared to place fifth in the competition. But after an inquiry by her coach, the judges agreed that Chiles deserved full credit for a leap they hadn’t scored and bumped her up to third place, above Barbosu and another Romanian gymnast, Sabrina Maneca-Voinea. The two Romanians had, in fact, received the same overall score, but in a tiebreaker, Barbosu was ranked higher based on her higher execution score.</p><p>The online backlash against Chiles’s bronze medal win was immediate, intense and unwarranted. But the slipshod nature of what has become a seemingly endless saga of inquiries and international rulings has cast a shadow over what should have been the sporting career highlight for three tremendous gymnasts.</p><p>The Romanian Gymnastics Federation appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an international body that settles disputes in international sporting competitions. It ruled that Chiles’s coach’s inquiry had come four seconds too late, voiding her appeal and revised score. The panel <a href="https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Media_Release_ParisOG_15-16.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">then ruled</a> that the International Gymnastics Federation should determine the final ranking of the gymnasts. The federation subsequently passed the decision on to the International Olympic Committee, which has stripped Chiles of her bronze.</p><p>There are additional complicating factors in this murky moral mess, including whether Chiles’s coach had in fact <a href="https://x.com/USAGym/status/1822724122951991331" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted the inquiry too late</a> or whether Maneca-Voinea, the other Romanian, should not have received an out-of-bounds deduction that lowered her score (video replays showed that she did not step out of bounds). If the judges had awarded Chiles full credit for her leap and more accurately scored Maneca-Voinea, then Maneca-Voinea would have finished third, Chiles fourth and Barbosu fifth.</p><p>There’s also a timeliness factor: If the Chiles inquiry was, in fact, too late, then it should not have been accepted. But it was accepted, and now the International Olympic Committee has decided to take back a bronze medal days after it was awarded, a<strong> </strong>dishonor usually reserved for athletes who have doped.</p><p>The Romanian Gymnastics Federation has proposed a solution that would ameliorate the mistakes made by officials that make sense: rank all three gymnasts third and give them all bronze medals. There is precedent for awarding duplicate medals (albeit in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/16/sports/olympics-figure-skating-canadian-skaters-awarded-share-olympic-gold-french-judge.html" title="">figure skating</a>), and such a move would duly acknowledge that these three gymnasts were failed more by their judges than their own skill.</p><p>For sports like gymnastics, which are arbitrated by judges instead of, say, the click of a finish line camera, crediting gymnasts with the appropriate difficulty levels and accurately determining whether they stayed in bounds is crucial for the sport to function fairly. Given the incompetence of these officials, awarding each of these athletes a medal would be the most just outcome.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE4ODJjNTZiLWIzYjMtNTAzOS1iNmYzLTIzNmFlZGNlZDZhOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#krugman-inflation-bacon-trump" data-source-id="100000009626838"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman"><img alt="Paul Krugman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-13T14:18:20.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 13, 2024, 10:18 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The data keep telling us that inflation is basically over as a problem.</p><p>This morning we got the latest report on <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">producer prices</a>, and it was “soft.” That’s a good indicator for the much more widely watched Consumer Price Index, which we’ll get tomorrow. More important, the details in the report were especially encouraging for yet another price index, personal consumption expenditures, which won’t be released until later this month but which the Federal Reserve prefers as a basis for monetary policy.</p><p>This report follows some good news about inflation expectations.</p><p>Economists generally believe that the stagflation of the 1970s was so hard to end, requiring years of high unemployment, because expectations of continuing high inflation had become entrenched among businesses and consumers. Two years ago, when inflation was near its recent peak, I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/opinion/inflation-1980s-recession-biden.html" title="">argued</a> that disinflation would be much easier this time because it wasn’t similarly entrenched.</p><p>I was right. In fact, yesterday the widely followed New York Fed <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/inflexp-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey of consumer expectations</a> found that expected inflation over the next three years has fallen to its lowest level since the survey began in 2013:</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: New York Federal Reserve</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Still, some people are having a hard time letting go of the narrative that America is suffering from runaway inflation. Among those people, of course, is Donald Trump, who ranted about consumer prices in last night’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/politics/trump-musk-x-fact-check.html?smid=url-share" title="">conversation with Elon Musk</a>.</p><p>I continue to be especially struck by Trump’s odd obsession with the price of bacon, which he insists costs “four or five times more than it did a few years ago.” This simply isn’t true. Indeed, while bacon prices are up, most workers’ wages are up considerably more:</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, St. Louis Federal Reserve</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Honestly, I find Trump’s delusions about smoked pork harder to understand than his conspiracy theories about crowd sizes. After all, grocery prices are part of everyday experience, and easy to check. Why haven’t some big, strong men with tears in their eyes come up to him to say, “Sir, you’re wrong about bacon”?</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2M4ZWViM2I4LTQ5YjgtNWIwZi1hMTM3LWY1OGVjZTgyMWJlZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#the-problem-is-not-ai-its-the-disbelief-created-by-trump" data-source-id="100000009625153"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zeynep-tufekci"><img alt="Zeynep Tufekci" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-12T17:57:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 12, 2024, 1:57 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Current artificial intelligence technologies have become surprisingly good at creating realistic images and video, unleashing fears that fake images can be used for political and election manipulation.</p><p>Well, yes and no.</p><p>Fake A.I. imagery is a challenging problem, and not simply because it looks realistic. The key issue is that these images muddy the waters of credibility for everyone while providing a handy excuse for political operatives willing to lie to their supporters already eager to believe the lie.</p><p>Take Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/us/politics/trump-harris-crowds-ai.html" title="">social media post</a> on Sunday in which he accused Kamala Harris’s campaign of manipulating an image to make her crowd seem bigger at a Detroit airplane hangar last week.</p><p>“Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?” he wrote. “There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!”</p><p>How do we know an image is real in this day and age? An average person can no longer be certain of the authenticity of images or, increasingly, even videos through individual sleuthing. The A.I. is that good and is getting better. (That’s why the classic media literacy advice — do your own research — doesn’t work anymore.)</p><p>This makes it difficult to know what to believe, except through a key mechanism: trusting sources and trusting that they have either taken the image or video themselves or carefully vetted it as authentic.</p><p>That’s how we know that the crowd waiting for Harris was real, because there are pictures from photo agencies like Getty, as well as images and reports from multiple other news organizations that were on the tarmac, that match the circulating social media photos that caught Trump’s ire. We know that credible news organizations and photo agencies have very strict rules about images and videos. But that, in turn, requires trusting the photo agency or other media source furnishing the image or video.</p><p>It’s no accident that Trump has made it a habit to portray credible news organizations as untrustworthy liars, and many of his supporters seem to have internalized that message they were open to in the first place.</p><p>Once trust is lost and all credibility is questioned, the lie doesn’t have to be high quality. It doesn’t have to be supported by highly realistic fake A.I. It doesn’t have to be so easily disprovable. To work, the lie just needs a willing purveyor and an eager audience. The A.I., then, is but a fig leaf.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMzYWVkNDAyLWQxYTItNThkOC1hYTE1LWE0YzM0ZjljNTZiMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#olympics-most-successful-nation" data-source-id="100000009624807"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-coy"><img alt="Peter Coy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/27/opinion/author-peter-coy-2/Peter_Coy_Final-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-12T15:06:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 12, 2024, 11:06 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>China and the United States tied for gold medals at 40 apiece, and the United States had more medals overall, but the most successful nation at the Paris Olympics was Australia. France was second, followed by Britain and the Netherlands, with the United States coming in fifth and China 89th.</p><p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.olympicnationalrankings.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new ranking method</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/opinion/paris-olympics-medals-winner.html" title="">I wrote about</a> ahead of the Games. Its inventors, Robert Duncan and Andrew Parece, wanted a method that wouldn’t overly favor the most-populous nations, but also wouldn’t give the top ranking every four years to a small country that gets a medal or two. (This year Grenada, with two medals, had the most per capita, followed by Dominica and St. Lucia.)</p><p>Australia tends to do well by their method. It also came out on top in the Tokyo Games. (It bears repeating, of course, that there is no official national winner, because the Games are a competition among athletes, not countries.)</p><p>The Duncan-Parece method ranks countries according to how improbable their medal counts are, on the assumption that all medal-winning nations have an equal propensity per capita for winning medals.</p><p>As they wrote in their paper on the subject: “We simply ask: how probable is it, in this idealization, for a given high-performing country (with a given population) to have won as many medals as it actually did, or more medals?”</p><p>Their <a href="https://byjus.com/binomial-distribution-formula/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">measure of improbability</a> is the one you would use to calculate the likelihood of flipping heads, say, 10 times in a row.</p><p>There seems to be growing interest in the subject. Duncan emailed me on Sunday to say that people from 153 countries had visited their website, <a href="https://www.olympicnationalrankings.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">olympicnationalrankings.com</a>.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhjMTJkYzg0LTE3ZWQtNWIxNS04OTQ5LTViOGUyYjdiMzczZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint#tipsheet-harris-trump-define" data-source-id="100000009624153"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-12T09:05:01.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 12, 2024, 5:05 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we kick off the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign.

Kamala Harris has not yet released information about upcoming events but did say over the weekend that her campaign would release an economic policy proposal this week.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Everything changes so fast right now that taking stock of the race can feel like an ephemeral pursuit, but in a series of polls, including the New York Times/Siena poll, Harris has either pulled even with Trump or has moved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/harris-trump-battleground-polls.html" title="">ahead</a> in some places.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>At the very least, the campaign has been reset to a toss-up, compared with the anemic state of President Biden’s polling against Trump. Nate Cohn of The Times observed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1822240430131495021" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sharp thread</a> on Twitter over the weekend that people’s perception of Harris wasn’t totally stable — it’s changed in the last few weeks as she’s become more popular, and could change again. But, he added, “at least for now, we’re getting a reminder of what happens when the Democrats nominate a broadly acceptable candidate against Trump and his allies: They do pretty well.”</p></li><li><p>Harris is known to people, but is also totally new as a candidate. One place that the idea of Harris is being shaped for people, especially in battlegrounds, is on TV and in digital advertising. The first weekend of the Olympics, I was in A Battleground State for the weekend, and could see it in real time: It felt as if each commercial break alternated between “Kamala Harris is good” and “Kamala Harris is bad.”</p><p>The emphasis in the negative advertising was on the <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1821164625313898886/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">border</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1818261358502096905/video/1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially</a>.</p></li></ul><div><div><blockquote data-cards=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pro-Trump group MAGA Inc. is up on TV with this spot --</p>— Medium Buying (@MediumBuying) <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1821164625313898886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
