By noon, the air quality was indexed at 182, an improvement. But above 150, the air is considered “unhealthy,” and the ill effects might start to be felt by people who are not in sensitive groups.</p><p>In Richfield, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis, outdoor recreational programs scheduled for Tuesday were canceled because of weather and air quality concerns, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1114308697395178&amp;set=a.233445832148140" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the city’s government said</a> in a statement shared on Facebook.</p><p>Images on social media <a href="https://x.com/RichardHindsRT/status/1929519091162755549" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showed hazy skies above St. Paul early Tuesday</a>, with some <a href="https://x.com/njswanson/status/1929913366350303328" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people reporting</a> damp, campfire-like smells mixing with the rain in the area.</p><p>Patrick Nathan, a store manager at Subtext Books, an independent bookstore in St. Paul, said Tuesday’s combination of bad air quality and rain was a new and puzzling experience. With the rain, he did not smell any smoke or notice hazy skies, he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/weather/wildfires-canada-smoke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">Canada’s wildfire season</a> got off to a grim start last month when two people were killed in the province of Manitoba as a wildfire raged, forcing the evacuation of an entire town.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last week in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, neighboring provinces in Canada’s prairies, dozens of wildfires spread out-of-control, displacing thousands of residents.

There’s a chance the dust and smoke particles could meet in Florida, but the more likely scenario is that the smoke will be leaving as the dust arrives, Mr. Chenard said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“They’re both being moved by the same wind,” he said. “As the dust moves into Florida tomorrow, the smoke actually gets pushed north out of Florida.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
