according to people with knowledge of the company and internal documents.</p><p>Concerns about the reporting practices â and particularly about Mr. Musk, who is SpaceXâs chief executive â have triggered at least three federal reviews, eight people with knowledge of the efforts said. The Defense Departmentâs Office of Inspector General opened a review into the matter this year, and the Air Force and the Pentagonâs Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for <a href="https://ousdi.defense.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intelligence and Security</a> separately initiated reviews last month.</p><p>The Air Force also recently denied Mr. Musk a high-level security access, citing potential security risks associated with the billionaire. Several allied nations, including Israel, have also expressed concerns that he could share sensitive data with others, according to defense officials.</p><p>Internally, SpaceX has a team that is expected to ensure compliance with the governmentâs national security rules. Some of those employees have complained to the Defense Departmentâs Office of Inspector General and other agencies about the lax reporting, which goes back to at least 2021, four people with knowledge of the company said. SpaceX <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" title="">was awarded at least $10 billion</a> in federal contracts with the Pentagon and NASA from 2019 to 2023, making it a major contractor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk is facing scrutiny as he wields increasing power around the world through his myriad businesses â particularly SpaceX but also the social media company X and the electric carmaker Tesla. While the 53-year-old has long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/technology/elon-musk-twitter-plan.html" title="">blown past norms and conventions</a> that do not suit him or his companies, the stakes are arguably higher when it comes to national security matters.</p><p>For years, SpaceX workers responsible for upholding disclosure rules grudgingly allowed Mr. Musk to disregard many of the reporting procedures, as they did not want to lose their jobs, the people with knowledge of the company said. But the issue has reached a tipping point as Mr. Muskâs influence is set to escalate. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-rbg-election.html" title="">ardent supporter</a> of President-elect Donald J. Trump, he was named last month to help lead an effort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump.html" title="">to winnow the federal bureaucracy</a> and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/trump-musk-zelensky.html" title="">joined calls</a> that Mr. Trump has held with foreign leaders.</p><p>Some SpaceX workers have become concerned about Mr. Muskâs ability to handle sensitive information, especially as he posts openly on X about everything from video games to diplomatic meetings, the people said. The fears have been compounded because Mr. Musk has a top secret security clearance at SpaceX, which makes him privy to classified material such as advanced U.S. military technology.</p><p>Under security clearance rules, Mr. Musk must report information about his private life and foreign travel, among other details, to the Defense Department as part of a process known as â<a href="https://www.dcsa.mil/Personnel-Security/Continuous-Vetting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continuous vetting</a>.â That allows the government to evaluate whether someone with a high-level security clearance should continue handling sensitive information.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/00musk-national-security-musk-tcph/00musk-national-security-musk-tcph-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/00musk-national-security-musk-tcph/00musk-national-security-musk-tcph-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/16/multimedia/00musk-national-security-musk-tcph/00musk-national-security-musk-tcph-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Elon Musk, seen from the side, looks toward the camera while striding along a sidewalk.

He has also not reported his use of drugs, which is required even with a prescription, they said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is unclear why Mr. Musk did not report some of this information to the government, especially since he sometimes posts on X about matters that he does not relay to the Defense Department. It is also unclear if Mr. Musk instructed SpaceX to not report the information. No federal agency has accused him of disclosing classified material.</p><p>Still, âto have someone who has major contracts with the government who would be in a position to pass along â whether deliberately or inadvertently â secrets is concerning,â said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire and a member of the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations.</p><p>Last month, Ms. Shaheen asked the Air Force and the Defense Departmentâs Office of Inspector General to investigate whether Mr. Musk was having inappropriate communications with foreign leaders, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p><p>The Air Force and the Pentagonâs Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security initiated their reviews in response to questions from Ms. Shaheen and another lawmaker. On Friday, a day after The New York Times asked the secretary of the Air Force, Frank Kendall, about the matter, he responded to Ms. Shaheen, saying federal privacy laws prohibited him from discussing Mr. Muskâs case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>âThe Department of the Air Force takes security matters very seriously, and I share your concerns,â <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/141bfff8333e1dc6/777e22e6-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>.</p><p>Whether the federal reviews will affect Mr. Musk or SpaceX is unclear. Some of the SpaceX employees who complained about the privately held companyâs reporting practices have been fired or forced out, the people with knowledge of the rocket maker said. Two defense officials said senior Pentagon leaders had given directives to avoid discussing the matter so they would not become targets of Mr. Musk, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/technology/elon-musk-cost-cuts.html" title="">promised to cut government workers and budgets</a> in his new role in Washington.</p><p>As a matter of constitutional law, Mr. Trump could grant a security clearance to anyone after his inauguration, even if others in the government object.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>SpaceXâs Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas.

Until about 2018, he held a midlevel secret clearance at SpaceX, they said. That year, the company applied for a higher level of clearance known as âtop secretâ on his behalf.</p><p>Many SpaceX employees hold some level of security clearance since the company is a defense contractor that puts NASA astronauts into orbit and provides its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/28/business/starlink.html" title="">Starlink satellite internet service</a> to the military. It is also helping the federal government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/politics/spacex-spy-satellites-elon-musk.html" title="">build</a> a new constellation of spy satellites.</p><p>Security clearances are critical for the government to protect intelligence and state secrets. Officials examine an applicantâs financial background and personal relationships, interviews the applicantâs friends and family and collects documents outlining the personâs history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, which is in charge of vetting individuals seeking access to classified information, took more than two years â an atypical length that was more than double the average time â to approve Mr. Muskâs top secret security clearance, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Top secret is the highest clearance through the security agency, but some government departments offer separate levels of access to classified materials that can be higher.</p><p>During that period, Mr. Musk was filmed on Joe Roganâs podcast smoking pot, which remains illegal at the federal level and is prohibited under security clearance rules. His <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/world/asia/musk-china-tesla-explained.html" title="">business interests in China</a>, where Tesla has a factory, were also a concern, the people familiar with the matter said.
