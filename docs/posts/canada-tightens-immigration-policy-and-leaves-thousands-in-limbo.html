It is even higher for temporary residents, at 14 percent.</p><p>Many Canadian cities face a housing affordability crisis, and several provinces have overstretched health care systems.</p><p>Critics say the large number of temporary residents make these problems worse, and the public mood toward immigrants has soured.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In response, Marc Miller, the country’s immigration minister, has announced a series of cuts to immigration quotas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/world/canada/canada-immigration-international-students.html" title="">since the start of this year</a>, including lowering the number of student visas issued and capping the number of temporary foreign workers that a company can employ.</p><p>As part of the government’s efforts to rein in the temporary residence program, expiring or expired work permits for many immigrants — like Mr. Singh — may not be renewed.</p><p>“Immigration, writ large, has been, in part, responsible for preventing us from going into a recession,” Mr. Miller told the news media last month. “But I think it’s safe to admit that we have allowed certain aspects of this to get overheated, and probably for too long.”</p><p>Mr. Miller did not respond to a request for comment. The government is expected to impose further restrictions next month.</p><p>With one in five Canadians born overseas, the country has long been open to immigrants. Conservative and Liberal governments have historically promoted immigration policies meant to bolster the ranks of workers and increase the population.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>But that is now shifting. Most Canadians, polls show, believe the country has taken in too many newcomers in too short a period. An <a href="https://leger360.com/federal-voting-intentions-august-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">August poll</a>, for example, showed that two-thirds of Canadians feel the current immigration policy is letting too many people in.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Couriers last month in Toronto.

Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/trump-immigration-republicans-explained.html" title="">promising mass deportations</a> and Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/harris-democrats-immigration.html" title="">presenting a tougher line</a> than in her party’s past positions. In Europe, the topic has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/world/europe/eu-migration-asylum.html" title="">recast politics</a> over the last decade, fueling a rise in anti-immigrant and, in some cases, openly racist political parties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Still, the overwhelming majority of Canada’s immigrants arrived legally, and, despite the recent change of sentiment, political discourse remains broadly civil.</p><p>Some experts argue that stresses on the housing market or health care reflect chronic underinvestment by the government, rather than the consequences of high immigration rates.</p><p>Still, the tension between the influx of immigrants and the economic problems can be seen playing out in places like Brampton, a city near Toronto where many Indian students and temporary workers have settled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gurpartap Singh Toor, a local elected leader in Brampton and the surrounding region of Peel, said newcomers had added to the demands for housing and health care. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Gurpartap Singh Toor, a local councilor for Brampton and the broader region of Peel, arrived in Canada in 2011 as a migrant.

He could go back to India, his least appealing possibility, given the years and the money he has invested in Canada.</p><p>The limbo facing many temporary residents whose permits have expired, or soon will, is pushing some into harmful or illegal paths, said Gurpreet Malhotra, the chief executive at Indus Community Services, a government-funded group helping migrants.</p><p>Some, he said, end up staying illegally and working as cleaners, in warehouses or restaurant kitchens, for a fraction of the minimum wage. A desperate need for money also makes them vulnerable to being recruited by criminal groups, he said.</p><p>Some also file asylum claims even if they do not meet the criteria because it buys them time to stay, he added. Some 13,000 international students made asylum requests in the first eight months of this year, according to government data, more than double the figure for all of last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A site in Brampton where immigrants have organized protests.
