    <h1>Sinners’ Director Ryan Coogler Narrates Musical Scene</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Rafael is from Oakland, kind of a local legend where I’m from,” Coogler said, narrating the moment.</p><p>The scene starts with Caton’s impressive vocals, while cutting to shots of both Smoke and Stack, as well as other characters in the sequence. “We wanted to use Michael Shawver’s editing skills to establish where everybody is and what their stakes are,” Coogler said.</p><p>Once all is laid out, the scene flashes back to a conversation between Sammie and another musician, Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo), who explains Sammie’s skill for the blues and the responsibility that comes with his talent.</p><p>“Blues, it wasn’t forced on us like that religion,” Delta says. “No, son. We brought this with us from home. It’s magic, what we do. It’s sacred and big.”</p><p>As the scene returns to the juke joint, we hear a voice-over from Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), a conjure woman. She says that some musicians have the gift to make music so powerful, it can conjure spirits from the past and the future. At this point, in an ambitious tracking shot, various eras of musicians appear in the frame, including an electric guitarist and the D.J. at the turntable.</p></div></div>
