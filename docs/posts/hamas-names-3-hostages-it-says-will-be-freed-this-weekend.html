Israel is slated to release scores of Palestinian prisoners this weekend in exchange for the three men.</p><p>The three were abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023, surprise attack on Israel when Hamas and its allies killed roughly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostage, according to the Israeli authorities, setting off the war in Gaza. Israel’s subsequent military campaign against Hamas in Gaza has lasted for over a year and killed more than 45,000 people, according to local health officials.</p><p>In a multiphase cease-fire deal that Israel and Hamas agreed to this month, Hamas pledged to free at least 33 of the 97 remaining hostages over the first six weeks in exchange for over 1,500 Palestinians jailed by Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>About 10 Israeli captives have been freed so far, in additional to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/middleeast/thailand-israel-hostages-hamas.html" title="">five Thai workers</a> who were taken hostage in the October 2023 attack while working in Israeli villages near the Gaza border. Israel has released more than 300 Palestinian prisoners, including many who were serving life sentences for involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Bibas family’s home in Kibbutz Nir Oz.

Israeli officials have not publicly confirmed that assertion, but have said that they are gravely concerned for the fate of the three captives.</p><p>Mr. Siegel was taken hostage from his home in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
