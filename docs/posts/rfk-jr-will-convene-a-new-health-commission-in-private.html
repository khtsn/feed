    <h1>RFK Jr. Will Convene a New Health Commission in Private</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose first month in office has been shadowed by a growing measles outbreak in West Texas, will convene the first meeting of President Trump’s Make America Healthy Again Commission in private on Tuesday afternoon, and will later meet with “MAHA moms” and other allies, according to several people with knowledge of the events.</p><p>The commission takes its name from the movement created by Mr. Kennedy, who will serve as chairman. Composed of cabinet secretaries and other top federal officials, the panel has the broad goal of “understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to an executive order</a> signed by Mr. Trump on Feb. 13, hours after Mr. Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in.</p><p>The group’s inaugural meeting will be at the White House complex, according to several people who will attend; it was not on Mr. Trump’s schedule, and it was not clear whether the president would attend. The agenda has not been made public.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy is perhaps best known as a vaccine skeptic; his management of the Texas measles outbreak has drawn scrutiny because he has promoted alternative treatments, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title="">including cod liver oil</a> and vitamin A, while avoiding a full-throated endorsement of vaccination, which scientists and public health experts say is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease.</p></div></div>
