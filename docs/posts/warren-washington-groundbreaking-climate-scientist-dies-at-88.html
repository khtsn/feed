Washington, a scientist who helped invent one of the first computer models of the earth’s atmosphere, paving the way to accurately measure human-induced climate change, died on Oct. 18 at his home in Denver. He was 88.</p><p>His death was confirmed by a spokesman for the National Center for Atmospheric Research, where Dr. Washington was a senior scientist and had worked for more than 50 years.</p><p>Dr. Washington was a pioneer in two senses.</p><p>The son of a Pullman-car porter in Portland, Ore., he became the second Black student in the United States to receive a Ph.D. in meteorology.</p><p>He was also one of the country’s first and most influential climate scientists, advising five presidents on climate change and serving as a mentor to generations of researchers who followed him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In 1964 — the same year Dr. Washington received his Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University — he and Akira Kasahara, a colleague at the Center for Atmospheric Research, created a computer model replicating aspects of the earth’s atmosphere and climate. Although it was built on a rudimentary early computer, it could be used to demonstrate the effects of human-induced changes on the planet.</p><p>The “models that we started with in 1964 were very primitive,” Dr. Washington said in <a href="https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/warren-morton-washington-41" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2006 interview</a> for The HistoryMakers, an online archive of conversations with significant Black Americans. “The early models were simple atmosphere models. Then we added oceans. Then we added sea ice. Then we added land surface vegetation.”</p><p>Over the years, as the model grew more sophisticated, the two scientists were able to adjust for additional factors, including the sun’s output and the amount of methane or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Washington with John Humbrecht, a colleague, in 1983 with a new piece of equipment: a Ramtek 6211 Colorgraphic terminal, which was able to display weather data in color.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">R. Bumpas/University Corporation for Atmospheric Research</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Dr. Washington’s suspicions about human-induced climate change began long before it was a commonly accepted phenomenon.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Back in the 1960s, “there were environmental concerns,” he said in the 2006 interview. “You know, we’re increasing carbon dioxide, we’re seeing even early signs of changes in the climate system, but we couldn’t study them very well.”</p><p>That, he added, was why he and his colleague “had to build models to help us understand what was going on.”</p><p>Those computer models are now “a major tool in explaining climate change,” Richard A. Anthes, a former director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview.</p><p>By the late 1970s, Dr. Washington and other scientists at the center were becoming “increasingly concerned” — as he put it in his autobiography, “Odyssey in Climate Modeling, Global Warming, and Advising Five Presidents” (2006) — about how the climate was affected by an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide, which seemed to be caused by burning fossil fuels. In 1978, Dr. Washington was named chief investigator of a government-funded project looking into global warming, this issue in particular.</p><p>That work, and subsequent investigations, left Dr. Washington in no doubt. “With every successive assessment, the evidence of humankind-caused climate change has become stronger and the science has become stronger,” he wrote in his autobiography.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But it was an uphill struggle, particularly under Republican administrations. He recalled that President Ronald Reagan “wanted to get rid of the Weather Service,” as he put it in 2006. As a member of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmospheres, he testified against this idea in Congress. “It’s the responsibility of the government,” he said, “to be concerned about the public safety of people.”</p><p>President George H.W. Bush’s chief of staff, John Sununu, later insisted that Dr. Washington design a climate model that would run on his personal Compaq computer at the White House, so he could test theories of climate change for himself. (Dr. Sununu was a deep skeptic.) Although Dr. Washington knew that would not lead to meaningful analysis, he went along with the idea anyway.</p><p>“When you get asked by somebody in the White House to do something, even if it’s a stupid idea, I’ve always felt it was not good to sort of embarrass them about it,” he told The HistoryMakers.</p><p>James Edward Hansen of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, one of the few other scientists sounding an early alarm on climate change in the 1980s, wrote in an email that he remembered Dr. Washington “for his mastery of the complex science of global climate modeling, and for his calm, levelheaded analysis of the issues in climate change.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But “what sticks in my mind,” Dr. Hansen added, “is his generosity as a human being — when we were widely criticized for an unconventional approach, he was the one who, unsolicited, jumped to our defense.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Barack Obama presented Dr. Washington with the National Medal of Science in 2010.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Warren Morton Washington was born on Aug. 28, 1936, in Portland, the son of Edwin Washington, who worked on the Union Pacific Railroad, and Dorothy Grace Morton, a pediatric nurse.</p><p>In his autobiography, he recounted what it was like to move into a white neighborhood, where his family was received with hostility: “My father sat on the front of our home with a handgun to show his defiance to those neighbors.”</p><p>Apart from that experience, he recalled a relatively untroubled upbringing. From his father, he inherited an interest in science — there was a telescope in the family home — and an early penchant for activism. He served as vice president of the Junior N.A.A.C.P. in Portland while he was still at Jefferson High School, from which he graduated in 1954.</p><p>After receiving a bachelor’s degree in physics from Oregon State University in 1958, he went on to earn a master’s in general sciences from the same institution in 1960. In 1963, while he was a graduate student at Penn State, he was hired by the new National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo., where he would spend the rest of his career, becoming a senior scientist in 1975 and later head of the Climate and Global Dynamics Division.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Over the years, Dr. Washington won numerous awards and was appointed to various environmental bodies. In 1994, he served as president of the American Meteorological Society, which gave him the Charles E. Anderson Award in 1999. In 2007, he was part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore. And in 2010, President Barack Obama awarded Dr. Washington the National Medal of Science. The textbook he wrote with Claire L. Parkinson, “An Introduction to Three-Dimensional Climate Modeling,” originally published in 1986, remains a widely used reference work.</p><p>Dr. Washington is survived by his wife, Mary (Curtis) Washington; three daughters, Teri Ciocco, Kim Pierce and Tracy Smith; and 10 grandchildren, including the professional soccer player Reggie Cannon.</p><p>Dr. Washington’s conviction that humans were transforming the earth only grew as his work progressed.</p><p>“We’re seeing glaciers melting all around the world,” he said in 2006. “All of this is leading to a change in climate that we haven’t seen for thousands and thousands of years.”</p><p>“The concentration of carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, is greater than at any time in the last 600,000 years,” he continued. “We’re making profound changes on the climate.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Nossiter has been bureau chief in Kabul, Paris, West Africa and New Orleans, and is now a Domestic Correspondent on the Obituaries desk.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nossiter">More about Adam Nossiter</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
