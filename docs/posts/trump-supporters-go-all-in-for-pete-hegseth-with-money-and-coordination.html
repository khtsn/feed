Trump’s secretary of defense — or face daunting political fallout it they do not.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth, a military veteran and former television anchor, has been grappling with a variety of damaging accusations — including bouts of heavy drinking, financial mismanagement and sexual assault — that critics are using to question his fitness for the post. At the same time, he has also been dogged by concerns that he lacks the management experience needed to manage a Defense Department with a budget of more than $800 billion and nearly three million employees.</p><p>Mr. Trump has so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/pete-hegseth-trump-defense-secretary.html" title="">stood by</a> Mr. Hegseth, encouraging him to fight the allegations over his past conduct. Mr. Hegseth has denied that he committed sexual assault, saying the encounter with the complainant in 2017, was consensual. He said he was a victim of a smear campaign. A phalanx of well-financed groups that back Mr. Trump and his cabinet picks, including popular podcasters and political advocacy groups, say Mr. Hegseth is the right person for the job and have helped make his political survival a cause célèbre.</p><p>Some of those efforts are being coordinated with senior advisers to Mr. Trump, according to several people who are involved and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss strategy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A Trump transition official did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The concerted push is a sharp departure from Mr. Trump’s first administration, when his outside supporters’ efforts were often scattershot and underfunded.</p><p>This time around, backers of Mr. Trump and his agenda are “pretty coordinated,” said Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump White House adviser whose podcast, “War Room,” has talked up Mr. Hegseth and other cabinet picks.</p><p>“We know that one of the mistakes from the first time around was that we didn’t really have any outside groups, and the ones that were around weren’t really on board with the Trump agenda,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview. “This time, it’s more sophisticated, it’s got more money, it’s got a whole media and influencer ecosystem, and it started earlier, because a lot of it came out of the campaign.”</p><p>Outside groups are promoting Mr. Hegseth in myriad ways.</p><p>Officials from a conservative advocacy group called Article III Project have appeared on television and on podcasts, <a href="https://x.com/lucasiowa/status/1867649770359312462" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including Mr. Bannon’s</a>, to encourage listeners to use their website to contact senators in support of Mr. Hegseth. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and a linked advocacy group, are <a href="https://www.heritage.org/press/heritage-launches-1-million-campaign-support-expediting-president-trumps-cabinet-appointments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spending $1 million</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sntbZ_Shf7g" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ads and other efforts</a> supporting the potential defense secretary and other Trump nominees.</p><p>Building America’s Future, a nonprofit group that spent $45 million supporting Mr. Trump’s campaign directly and through allied super PACs, has aired <a href="https://x.com/bldgUSAfuture/status/1865124725204111486" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than $500,000 in ads</a> on Fox News and elsewhere, saying Mr. Hegseth is the victim of a “deep state” campaign to sink his nomination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And on Tuesday, just before Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation hearing, a group of Navy SEALs and other veterans plan to rally in support of Mr. Hegseth at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington — an effort promoted by Mr. Bannon.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth is not the only cabinet pick of Mr. Trump’s to face questions about his past behavior. Kash Patel, Mr. Trump’s choice for F.B.I. director, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/kash-patel-bravado-baggage-fbi.html" title="">accused by a former defense secretary</a> of endangering the rescue in 2020 of a kidnapped American citizen in Africa by fabricating information. Tulsi Gabbard, the presumed nominee for director of national intelligence, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-trump-russia.html" title="">expressed sympathy for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, a U.S. ally, and in 2017 visited Syria’s authoritarian president</a>, Bashar al-Assad, when she was serving in Congress.</p><p>But the closest Trump-era parallel to Mr. Hegseth’s case may be the confirmation process in 2018 for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who contended with claims of sexual assault and excessive alcohol consumption in his high school and college years. Mr. Kavanaugh, who was nominated by Mr. Trump, denied those accusations during a fractious Senate committee hearing. A brief follow-up investigation by the F.B.I. appeared not to support them, and he was quickly confirmed by the Senate by two votes.</p><p>Now, six years and one electoral comeback for Mr. Trump later, supporters of the president-elect’s agenda believe they can be much more aggressive in supporting his cabinet choices and agenda.</p><p>“Our job is to represent the grass-roots MAGA movement and help Republican senators find and keep their backbones,” said Mike Davis, the founder and president of Article III Project and a former chief counsel for nominations to the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Kavanaugh confirmation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In November, Mr. Davis <a href="https://x.com/mrddmia/status/1854200785975775609" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> of Mr. Trump’s past legal and political opponents that he wanted “to drag their dead political bodies through the streets, burn them, and throw them off the wall. (Legally, politically, and financially, of course.)”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mike Davis has used his conservative advocacy group called the Article III Project to promote Mr. Hegseth in myriad ways, including television and podcast appearances.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The groups bolstering Mr. Hegseth and other cabinet picks are deeper-pocketed and better connected to the president-elect than last time around.</p><p>“I think they are playing hardball, in a much more focused, targeted and calculated way,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat and longtime member of the Judiciary Committee. “You know, they’ve learned from experience.”</p><p>He added, “That’s putting a lot of pressure on my Republican colleagues.”</p><p>Building America’s Future has named Chris LaCivita, who helped run Mr. Trump’s campaign, and Tony Fabrizio, the campaign’s top pollster, as advisers; it has also taken in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/elections/trump-money-building-americas-future.html" title="">contributions from the billionaire Elon Musk</a>, whom Mr. Trump has named to lead a new enterprise focused on slashing government spending. Mr. Davis, who was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/09/20/mike-davis-trump-potential-attorney-general-profile-00179358" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">briefly floated as an attorney general candidate</a>, is in regular touch with Mr. Trump and is preparing several of his cabinet nominees for Senate hearings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Charlie Kirk, the founder of the grass-roots youth organization Turning Point USA, is also in regular contact with Mr. Trump’s inner circle as well as key Republican senators whose “no” votes could sink a Hegseth confirmation — a fact he has used to pressure them into supporting the potential nominee.</p><p>A super PAC called American Leadership PAC last week launched a $1 million advertising campaign calling on residents of five states to urge their senators to back Mr. Hegseth, according to a person familiar with it who requested anonymity and was not authorized to disclose financial details. The super PAC, which bills itself as “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/09/exclusive-anti-woke-super-pac-launching-7-figure-ad-blitz-supporting-secdef-nominee-hegseth-in-5-states/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anti-woke</a>,” is airing a <a href="https://x.com/Surabees/status/1877521716479476077" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television ad</a> predicting Mr. Hegseth will “ban woke nonsense from our armed forces,” and “make our military great again.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Charlie Kirk, the founder of the grass-roots youth organization Turning Point USA.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Watts for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The bare-knuckled approach appears to be gaining traction.</p><p>Last month, as Mr. Hegseth’s prospects for confirmation appeared to be dimming, Mr. Trump’s supporters targeted Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican and combat veteran who serves on the Armed Services Committee that will hold the confirmation hearings. Ms. Ernst initially <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ernst-hegseth-nominee-trump-vetting-assault-pentagon-138c79c9199c8525d43b77417674d81e" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seemed unconvinced that Mr. Hegseth should lead the Pentagon</a>. But under intensifying pressure — including a digital ad buy from Building America’s Future and a threat of a primary challenge in 2026 <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1864776462710247886?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed by Mr. Kirk</a> — she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/us/politics/ernst-hegseth-defense-trump.html" title="">signaled that she would be receptive</a> to supporting the nomination.</p><p>Article III Project officials say Republican senators are <a href="https://x.com/lucasiowa/status/1867649770359312462" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pleading with them to make the phones stop ringing</a> after an initiative in support of Mr. Hegseth that generated nearly 31,000 calls, emails and social-media posts.
