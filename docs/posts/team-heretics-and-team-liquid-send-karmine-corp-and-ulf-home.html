</span> home in overtime at the end of a three-map series.</p>



<p>The first match of the day was held between two teams that underwent different rebuilds over the offseason. Karmine Corp underwent a three-member rebuild, looking to change its fortunes in an effort to break into the region&#39;s upper echelon of teams. Meanwhile, Team Heretics made one change in the offseason in an attempt to become marginally better, having been one of the more prominent teams in EMEA over the past two years, with five international LANs reached in the past two years.</p>

<p>The series opened on KC&#39;s pick of Abyss, and immediately, it seemed like KC had identified a weakness in TH&#39;s approach to the map. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/20144/lewn">
		LewN	</a>
</span> spearheaded a dominant start to the map, finding 18 kills on attack to get things started on the right foot for KC.</p>

<p>KC&#39;s double-Controller comp proved to be tough to play against on both sides of the map, as <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/2858/suygetsu">
		SUYGETSU	</a>
</span>, on Astra, found strong lurk timings to open up the map, while the likes of LewN and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/16215/dos9">
		dos9	</a>
</span> wreaked havoc on-site. Team Heretics struggled to put up much of a fight in the map, falling 13-2 after a 10-2 first half.</p>

<p>The series then moved into TH&#39;s pick of Haven, a map that KC has gained some attention for its unique team comp in recent years, featuring a Duelist pairing of Yoru and Phoenix. A blend of playing anti-flash and moving in coordination during retakes helped Team Heretics disrupt KC&#39;s attack side, resulting in a 6-6 scoreline at halftime. TH claimed the opening pistol round of the second half to begin on a roll, and while KC shut down the would-be bonus, TH moved forward with four straight rounds, reaching match point and converting soon after to win 13-8.</p>


<p><em>Clean 1v2 from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29873/benjyfishy">
		benjyfishy	</a>
</span> with time running low.</em></p>

<p>The decider map of Corrode promised intrigue, as it was set to be the first time both teams played it in 2026. Both squads entered the map with their own twist on double-Controller, double-Initiator comps, with Tejo a central piece. While Team Heretics went for Brimstone and Viper with <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/40591/comeback">
		ComeBack	</a>
</span>&#39;s Jett as Waylay, KC went for Astra and Omen with LewN on Waylay.</p>

<p>Both teams went with a Tejo-Fade Initiator pairing, which provided plenty of post-plant utility on both sides. Armed with plenty of delay utility, TH opened the map on a strong run, winning the first four rounds. An &#34;in your face&#34; approach from KC saw the team pick off the defending TH players one by one as part of a run of five straight rounds, helping even the score at 6-6 at halftime.</p>

<p>The second half opened with all sorts of chaos, as Team Heretics converted a thrifty after a KC pistol round to turn the half upside down, and eventually go up 11-8. However, KC didn&#39;t go down without a fight. The likes of <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/1428/sheydos">
		sheydos	</a>
</span> thrived in the chaos, as he found 12 of his 15 kills on defense, to help mount a comeback of sorts, but KC could only get as far as 11 rounds before falling.</p>


<p><em>TH wins the battle of fine margins to flush the idea of overtime.</em></p>

<p>After having a map one to forget as a team, <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/29873/benjyfishy">
		benjyfishy	</a>
</span> led TH to the 2-1 win with a team-high 46 kills and 1.04 rating. Initiator player <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/10971/riens">
		RieNs	</a>
</span> had Team Heretics&#39; highest ACS on the day at 206, and also went 9-3 in first duels. KC Duelist LewN impressed in the loss, dropping 54 kills.</p>



<p>In a similar fashion to the first series of the day, ULF looked impressive to open on its map pick, threatening to pull off what could be a big lower bracket upset for the squad playing with two substitutes. Team Liquid, which was consistently a podium finisher in EMEA last year, was sent to the lower bracket after being arguably unlucky in its draw in the bracket, going up against <span data-ref-id="12">

<p>The series opened on ULF&#39;s pick of Split. Play was back-and-forth to start, with a three-round run from ULF being responded to with four straight from Liquid. The score was knotted at 6 apiece at halftime, but ULF thrived once it entered its attack side. ULF began by picking up its second pistol round of the map, and with a double-Initiator comp built around Breach and Fade, complementing Waylay, ULF was disruptive on its attack side.</p>


<p><em>Flashy 4K from <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/41720/favian">
		Favian	</a>
</span> to start the second half.</em></p>

<p>While Team Liquid shut down a would-be bonus, <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/12670/nekky">
		nekky	</a>
</span> led ULF to wrap up a strong attack half, closing out the map in a comfortable 13-8 fashion. nekky&#39;s 23 kills were the highest in the entire lobby on Split.</p>

<p>The series moved to Liquid&#39;s pick of Breeze, a map that it has won once and lost once with its double-Duelist, Jett-Yoru comp. Early on, everything was falling into place for Liquid. Heroic plays from the hands of <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/457/nats">
		nAts	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/24628/wayne">
		wayne	</a>
</span> fueled a 6-0 start to the map, and while ULF found five straight rounds before the end of the first half, Liquid was clinical on its attack side. </p>

<p>With the large map stretching defense numbers thin, Liquid played the numbers game to near-perfection. Almost every death on Liquid&#39;s attack half was promptly traded, as shown by four members finishing with 100% KAST on that side of the map. With no utility to punish grouped up players, Liquid thrived moving together along the sandy map, cruising to a 13-5 win to force a third map.</p>

<p>While it was set to be ULF&#39;s first time playing Pearl at the VCT level, Liquid had already played the map once before at Kickoff, finding a 14-12 win on it over Team Vitality. Liquid fielded a Waylay-Yoru double-Duelist comp, with nAts Killjoy. ULF opted for a KAY/O-Sova double-Initiator comp, with <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/12226/sturnn">
		sturNN	</a>
</span> on Chamber.</p>

<p>On ULF&#39;s attacking half, <span data-ref-id="20">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/18350/miniboo">
		MiniBoo	</a>
</span>&#39;s Operator put in work, contributing heavily in his four first bloods in that half of the map. The map was streaky and back-and-forth, ending in a 6-6 deadlock by halftime. The second half was more of the same, if not more chaotic, with both teams racing to close out the series. A run of three straight rounds from ULF threatened to close the series out, but the two teams went into overtime.</p>

<p>After picking up a round on defense thanks to MiniBoo&#39;s Operator and later a 1v1 conversion from wayne, Team Liquid marked its footprints all over the A site on attack to stamp its dominance over that half of the map to close things out.</p>


<p><em>Liquid finds the edge over ULF in a map that seemed like it may never end.</em></p>

<p>wayne and <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/14681/kamo">
