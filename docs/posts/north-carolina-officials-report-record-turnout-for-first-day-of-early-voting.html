    <h1>North Carolina Officials Report Record Turnout for First Day of Early Voting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than 353,000 ballots were cast in North Carolina on Thursday, a state record for the first day of early voting, signaling intense enthusiasm in a battleground state still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Helene and where 16 presidential electoral votes are up for grabs. But early insights into the significance of such high voter turnout were unclear.</p><p>Christopher A. Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, N.C., and Michael Bitzer, an expert on North Carolina politics at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., cautioned <a href="https://www.oldnorthstatepolitics.com/2024/10/what-can-NC-early-voting-tell-us.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a blog post</a> against reading too much into the data.</p><p>Using early voting data as a way to gauge who will win or lose the election, they said, is “like bringing a fishing pole to a home run derby — it’s just the wrong tool for the job.”</p><p>Still, Mr. Cooper said on X that the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina may significantly affect turnout. For example, in Buncombe County, which includes the large liberal city of Asheville, more than 33,000 ballots were cast on the first day of early voting in 2020. On Thursday, however, there were only about 8,200 cast in the county.</p></div></div>
