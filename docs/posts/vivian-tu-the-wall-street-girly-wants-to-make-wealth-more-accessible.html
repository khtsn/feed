Powell, the institution’s chair. “Pros: When the Fed lowers interest rates, we’ll see mortgages, car loans, personal and business loans, those rates will come down too.”</p><p>Then in a clip in October, Ms. Tu — who bills herself on social media as “Your Rich BFF” — explained how to know whether to refinance a home loan, walking tens of thousands of viewers through a mortgage calculator. That clip is nestled in her feed next to a photo of Ms. Tu slapping high fives with the former pro basketball player Shaquille O’Neal, giving travel advice pulled from her European vacations, offering tips on shopping for designer handbags and sharing her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourrichbff/video/7410413721610128683" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thoughts on</a> prenups.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Ms. Tu, 30, is creating what is often serious finance and economic content — it just doesn’t always look like it. She has mastered a candy-coated version of financial advice, with videos that embrace familiar TikTok formats like sassy <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourrichbff/video/6922656310026603782" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clap-backs</a> and makeup demonstrations, frequently delivered in on-point lash extensions and Instagrammable outfits.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In doing so, Ms. Tu has turned herself into something of a money role model for the TikTok generation, particularly the women whom she calls “besties.” On her podcast, “<a href="https://www.yourrichbff.com/networthandchill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Networth and Chill</a>,” which had more than two million downloads in its first season, she <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/651Wo289D5DpX6RG8Pv7px" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promises</a> “no dry economics lessons, though I will teach you about economics, and how it affects you.”</p><p>Ms. Tu has adopted the highly personal style of a modern TikTok influencer. She speaks passionately into the camera, outraged at a company ripping people off or excited about a new saving trick she’s found to share. She pulls her content from her own life. And as she does it, she embraces the style of speech that a millennial woman in traditional broadcast might be scolded for: voice modulation, hand flicks, hair flips.</p><p>She sounds, in a word, girly.</p><p>“At first, I was like: ‘Wow, I’m so lucky to be succeeding in spite of the fact that I’m a young woman who loves to wear a pink dress to an interview,’” she said during one at a SoHo events space, which she arrived to wearing sky-high wedge heels and a flowing maxi dress the hue of bubble gum. “But over time, I kind of came to the realization that like, I wasn’t succeeding in spite of that. I was succeeding because of that.”</p><p>Ms. Tu is one of several people pioneering a new model of personal economic and financial advice — and where the plain-English pros of the past often popped up on places like CNBC and daytime television, this new generation is taking to TikTok and other social media to spread its message. While several of the most prominent accounts are run by men, many are by and for women.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It’s like a small army of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/style/suze-orman-advice.html" title="">Suze Ormans</a>, the TV-famous financial guru, for a new generation.</p><p>And even among a crowd of people who are professionally influential, Ms. Tu stands out. Besides her millions of followers and more than 30 million likes on TikTok, she has three million followers on Instagram and has been invited to the White House to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and other administration officials about the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, a piece of legislation meant to encourage investments in green energy technologies and cap prescription costs. (Ms. Tu <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ0XMNdP0Ek" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a video</a> explaining the law and “what the heck that actually means for you.”)</p><p>She has interviewed celebrities like the tennis player Venus Williams and the author and former “Top Chef” host Padma Lakshmi on career growth and female mentorship. She’s been featured on Forbes’s 30 Under 30 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2023/social-media" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media list</a>. Soon after her book, “Rich AF,” was published early this year, she was one of only two female authors on The New York Times’s Top 10 Business Bestsellers list. The other was Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>“Your Favorite Wall Street Girly,” as Ms. Tu describes herself, has also attracted the backing of financial heavy-hitters eager to reach her audience. Her sponsors include financial services companies including SoFi, along with consumer product firms like Marshalls and Instacart. Between her platforms and book deals, she said she is booked to make $7 million this year.</p><h2 id="link-2417e99c">‘They Want to Hear From a Peer’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I don’t have any get-rich-quick schemes here,” Ms. Tu said in her first TikTok, “but I will help you with practical tips and knowledge on how to level up your financial literacy.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Ms. Tu is the daughter of Chinese immigrants (her father worked in computer programming at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center; her mother in consulting and chemistry) who live just outside Washington, D.C.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Her entry onto Wall Street was a conventional one: She decided to angle for finance in college because it seemed like a secure way to make a living. “I didn’t read fast enough to be a lawyer,” she said. “When I paper-cut my hand, I almost feel like I’m going to pass out, so I wasn’t going to be a doctor.”</p><p>After graduating from the University of Chicago in 2016 with a dual degree in environmental studies and public policy concentrated in finance, she started out as a trader at J.P. Morgan, initially focused on industrial and energy companies. Her energy and her Excel skills attracted the attention of mentors like Jean Mah, her first manager, whom Ms. Tu would later call the “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourrichbff/video/6913909386402450694?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">baddest chick</a> in the room.”</p><p>But two years into her job, the ground began to shift. She was moved into a different role, and her new manager seemed to discount her abilities because of her identity. According to Ms. Tu, he complained about how her nails click-clacked on the computer keyboard. At one point, he told her that she was “too girly” for the job. On another day, when she wore a long Ann Taylor cardigan to the office, he asked her if it was a kimono.</p><p>She wanted to quit on the spot.</p><p>Instead, she sought out Ms. Mah, who persuaded her not to do anything rash and to wait until the market closed that day, when they could talk about it in private. Ms. Mah then persuaded her to hang in until she could find a new job outside the firm, and helped her to land a sales position at BuzzFeed. “I thought she could do anything, because she was so hungry,” Ms. Mah said recently. J.P. Morgan declined to comment on Ms. Tu’s allegations about her manager.</p><p>The transition worked out. Ms. Tu is an extrovert who had worked as a club promoter in college, and her personality immediately clicked in sales. Within a few years, she said, she was earning more than $600,000 — far more than she had ever made in finance. But by then, she began to sense that another career path might beckon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Colleagues who knew about her Wall Street background began to seek her out for financial advice. She realized that she liked explaining 401(k)s and index funds in ways that her young colleagues found entertaining and relatable. “My work best friend said: I think you need to put this on the internet,” Ms. Tu recalled. That friend, Allison Kim, helped her to edit a script for an initial video.</p><p>That’s how she came to post her first TikTok, on New Year’s Day in 2021.</p><p>“Welcome to RichTok,” she said into the camera, introducing herself to the world in a clip that made fun of “sketchy” all-in-on-Bitcoin strategies and day trading. “I don’t have any get-rich-quick schemes here, but I will help you with practical tips and knowledge on how to level up your financial literacy.”</p><p>It quickly racked up <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourrichbff/video/6912857127002311941?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands</a> of views.</p><p>“Neither of us was expecting it to go as viral as it did,” Ms. Kim said. “It was like: This is the beginning of something huge.”</p><p>And as Ms. Tu watched the numbers climb, she quickly noticed that she was attracting a diverse audience.</p><p>“It became very clear to me just based on the profile pictures of people commenting that it was a large swath of women,” she said. “It was a large swath of people of color, members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, people who grew up low income, immigrants.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>She could, she thought, potentially speak to a crowd of people who “feel like the financial services industry has never, ever served them in the past.”</p><p>It was a niche, and she began to lean into it.</p><p>“They want to hear from a peer; they want to hear from someone who looks like they could be anybody’s college best friend,” she said. “No one has talked to these audiences about money. And certainly not this generation.”</p><p>A year and three months later, she quit BuzzFeed to become a full-time financial influencer.</p><h2 id="link-206dd931">The Rise of the ‘Finfluencer’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Suze Orman, right, in an interview with Ann Curry on the “Today” show in 2001.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Peter Kramer/NBCU</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Tu is not alone. She is part of a cottage industry of content creators who have begun to pump out economic, business and personal finance updates that are chatty and TikTok friendly. And while several of the most famous finance content creators are men, many of the largest accounts are both from and for women.</p><p>What Ms. Tu and her counterparts are doing isn’t entirely new. For as long as there have been markets and modern economies, there have been what you might call finfluencers — guides who broke down the wonky ways of high finance and macroeconomics for mass consumption.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>And it has often been women who have tried to make nerdy financial ideas interesting and relatable to other women.</p><p>In the early 1800s, a British author named <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jane-Marcet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jane Marcet</a> explained the lessons of Adam Smith and David Ricardo through a set of “conversations” between two fictional women (one character convinced the other that political economy touched everything, including fashion). Starting from the 1980s, a group of Illinois women — mostly in their 60s and 70s and called the “Beardstown Ladies” — sold folksy investment books that featured trading advice alongside dinner recipes. Though they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/01/us/beardstown-ladies-case-ends-in-offer-to-trade.html" title="">eventually sued</a> for mistakenly overstating their investment returns, their popularity <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2003/may/24/womenandmoney.jobsandmoney1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kicked off</a> a burst of interest in female investment clubs.</p><p>In the late 1990s, Suze Orman became a celebrity with best-selling books and a highly rated show on CNBC by marketing what The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17orman-t.html" title="">described in 2009</a> as very basic advice: “Track your spending. Stay out of debt. Take care of your car. Look into a Roth I.R.A.”</p><p>Midway through the 2020s, it is perhaps no surprise that the modern version of nerd-to-table finance comes in heavily edited clips and snappy posts. And given that women — who gained the ability to open a bank account independently in the United States only in 1974 — make up a growing force on Wall Street, many of the topics they are tackling are increasingly more sophisticated.</p><p>Creators on TikTok and Instagram churn out videos on everything from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-VwQQQhO8r/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">why stocks are selling off</a> to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-V73XvSdgW/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bank of Japan’s interest rate</a> setting to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-Vb4uOAcfP/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weighted average cost of capital</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But even as the topics take a turn for the serious, it has become almost a meme for some personal finance and economics accounts to lean into loud femininity. One is run <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nikitadumptruck?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by a woman</a> who strolls around New York City in bright pink makeup, explaining topics like foreign exchange and inflation in a delivery style that would make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clueless" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cher Horowitz</a> proud. (Others, including those with the biggest followings, are more focused on news-you-can-use personal finance issues, like flight discounts.)</p><p>It fits in with a broader online trend: Girl-coded media has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/10/opinion/girl-dinner-girlhood-tiktok.html" title="">been everywhere</a> in recent years, from “girl dinners” to “hot girl walks.” But female-targeting financial content could also have consequences if it continues to take off, because the gap that people like Ms. Tu are trying to fill is a real one. Women make up half the population but <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial%20Services/Our%20Insights/Women%20as%20the%20next%20wave%20of%20growth%20in%20US%20wealth%20management/Women-as-the-next-wave-of-growth-in-US-wealth-management.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">control just a third</a> of America’s wealth.</p><p>And it has long remained the case that women — and especially women of color — have been less educated in money management than men. In <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/financial-literacy-gender-gap/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one recent study</a>, men overall scored 25 percent better than women on financial literacy questions, and Black and Hispanic men scored 40 percent better than women in those groups. </p><p>And that comes alongside a lack of financial news consumption: Women are also less likely to follow financial news. Men accounted for about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/business/media/emma-tucker-wall-street-journal.html" title="">three in four</a> Wall Street Journal readers in 2023, for instance, and The Financial Times’s reader base has also <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/04/if-the-financial-times-were-a-person-it-would-be-a-man-heres-how-the-paper-is-trying-to-change-that/#:~:text=That&#39;s%20when%20we%20discovered%20that,mean%20is%20%E2%80%9Cpaying%20subscribers.%E2%80%9D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">historically</a> leaned toward men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Berna Anat, a fellow financial influencer, regularly refers to most financial content as “male, pale and stale.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amy Sussman/Instagram</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“Women have been at a disadvantage when it comes to money for centuries,” said Berna Anat, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heyberna/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fellow financial influencer</a> and friend of Ms. Tu’s. Ms. Tu often borrows a line from Ms. Anat that criticizes financial content as “male, pale and stale.”</p><h2 id="link-2c86ad9">Meeting at the White House</h2><p>The question is whether digital platforms will help to change the tide.</p><p>New outlets could spread information differently. It is unquestionably the case that young people are increasingly turning to social media platforms as a key news source.</p><p>Nearly half of 18- to 29-year-olds who use TikTok treat it as a source of political news, based on a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/20/about-half-of-tiktok-users-under-30-say-they-use-it-to-keep-up-with-politics-news/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent survey</a> by Pew Research Center, far above the more than 36 percent of users overall who use it for news. And <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram users</a> are also increasingly using that platform for news, as are those on LinkedIn and the video streaming platform Twitch.</p><p>That climbing relevance is lost on neither Washington nor Wall Street.</p><p>The Biden administration’s digital strategy office brought Ms. Tu in as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yourrichbff/video/7143284160495373611" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part of a group</a> — which also included people like the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/09/1127211983/the-white-house-is-turning-to-tiktok-stars-to-take-its-message-to-a-younger-audi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news wrap creator</a> V Spehar and the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@heyashleyrenne/video/7143690995064966446?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121351166%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.npr.org%2F2022%2F10%2F09%2F1127211983%2Fthe-white-house-is-turning-to-tiktok-stars-to-take-its-message-to-a-younger-audi&amp;referer_video_id=7143690995064966446" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vegan TikTokker</a> Ashley Renne — to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act. That move came as part of a push to step up outreach to influencers in general. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Christian Tom, the director of digital strategy for the White House, said that over the past four years, administration officials have invited creators in for briefings much the way they would invite the press, hoping to make sure they know what is happening and why it might matter for ordinary people.</p><p>“There is enormous value in working with digital creators who are able to help synthesize and share some of the pieces of legislation that otherwise can be complex for people,” he said. “The way that people engage with content online has evolved.”</p><h2 id="link-223516b3">The Risks of Misinformation</h2><p>Finance companies are also aware of the clout influencers hold as tastemakers, and they regularly pay business-focused influencers like Ms. Tu.</p><p>But the heavy presence of sponsorships underscores a risk to this new model of news dissemination. While it is accessible and made to be appealing, it can be tied to for-profit companies — and meant to sell a product — in nontransparent ways. (When asked if she always discloses her sponsored content, Ms. Tu’s spokespeople said she always does.)</p><p>Plus, it can be tough to distinguish facts from outright misinformation on social media. Many of the markers of legitimacy on a more traditional news website, like a well-known brand name and a professional interface, are stripped away. And misinformation can be especially hard to spot when it comes to complicated economy or finance claims that are tough to fact-check with a simple Google search.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Last year, for instance, a misleading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/business/economy/tiktok-biden-economy.html" title="">set of posts</a> arguing that America’s economy was in worse shape than it was in the Great Depression went viral on TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>“People don’t necessarily make the distinction between reliable news media and everything else,” said Peter Adams, senior vice president of research and design at the News Literacy Project, explaining that people getting news from social media should be particularly wary of anything meant to play on their emotions. They should also distinguish between influencers and journalists who operate according to strict newsroom standards guides, he said.</p><p>Ms. Tu said she has tried to position herself as an alternative to less scrupulous accounts, and says she fact-checks and researches her posts.</p><p>“If there’s anything that I even have an inkling of doubt about, I’ll then go do a deep dive, and make sure that I can find at a minimum three reputable sources that back up my claims,” she said.</p><p>She said she realized that there were limits to how much someone can become informed about complicated financial topics in a 45-second video. And the goal is not to step in for a financial adviser — it is to draw a set of viewers who might not otherwise be getting that beneficial financial content, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>The way to do that, she thinks, is by recognizing that making financial information fun for a heavily female audience is not equivalent to dumbing it down. Ms. Tu said femininity and financial understanding are often portrayed as two things that do not go together.
