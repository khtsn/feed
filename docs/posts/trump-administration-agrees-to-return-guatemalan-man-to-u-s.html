Murphy of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts. </p><p>Late last week, Judge Murphy ordered the government to “facilitate” O.C.G.’s return to the United States, finding that he was likely to “succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The government’s agreement to return O.C.G. represents a substantial de-escalation in a case that is shaping up to be one of the key courtroom battles over President Trump’s attempts to conduct mass deportations.</p><p>It also marks a departure from the more defiant stance that the administration has taken in other immigration matters, including the case of<strong> </strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. Mr. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador despite an order from an immigration court that he not be sent there, a mistake the government has called an “administrative error.”</p><p>In response to an order upheld by the Supreme Court requiring the government to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return, the Trump administration has said that it cannot bring him back because he is now imprisoned in El Salvador.</p><p>In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the government would continue to fight for more expansive deportation powers.</p><p>“This federal activist judge is ordering us to bring him back, so he can have an opportunity to prove why he should be granted asylum to a country that he has had no past connection to,” she said, referring to Judge Murphy. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. McLaughlin added: “America’s asylum system was never intended to be used as a de facto amnesty program or a catchall, get-out-of-deportation-free card.”</p><p>In 2024, when passing through Mexico on his way to the U.S. border, O.C.G. was kidnapped and raped by a group of men who released him only after his sister sent them money, he has said.</p><p>An immigration judge who barred authorities from deporting O.C.G. to Guatemala also assured him that he would not be deported to Mexico without further due process. U.S. authorities sent him there anyway. In Mexico, the authorities gave him a choice to be detained for months or return to Guatemala. He chose to return to his home country.</p><p>He lives alone there, in a house owned by his sister. He avoids going outside and rarely sees his family members. “Anything could happen to me in the street,” he told the court. “I am constantly afraid.”</p><p>He said he lives “in constant panic and constant fear” of persecution for being gay. “I can’t be gay here, which means I cannot be myself,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We are happy to see that D.H.S. is making the necessary arrangements to comply with the court’s order,” said Matt Adams, legal director for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, an immigrant advocacy group that represents O.C.G. “Time is of the essence as O.C.G. remains in hiding until he can be flown out.”</p><p>O.C.G.’s case is being considered as part of a larger lawsuit that deals with so-called third-country deportations, in which migrants are sent to places other than their home countries, where they do not have legal status.</p><p>The Trump administration has been negotiating with foreign governments over accepting U.S. deportees, including war-torn nations like Libya and South Sudan, as well as El Salvador, where more than 200 migrants were deported and then detained in a maximum-security prison.</p><p>Experts say third-country deportations to such countries are part of a larger strategy to scare other immigrants into self-deporting or avoiding the United States altogether.</p><p>As part of the same case, Judge Murphy is also grappling with the status of six detainees who have been held at an American military base in Djibouti. The men were given less than 24 hours’ notice that they were being deported to South Sudan, after an order from Judge Murphy that they be given at least 15 days. All have been convicted by U.S. courts of violent crimes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last week, Judge Murphy ordered the government to maintain custody of the men so they could have a “meaningful opportunity” to object to their deportation to the country, which is on the brink of civil war.</p><p>The conditions of their detention remain unclear. As of Wednesday afternoon, the deportees had not been given the chance to contact their lawyers by phone, as ordered by Judge Murphy last week, according to Trina Realmuto, one of their attorneys.</p><p>On Tuesday, the government asked the Supreme Court to intervene and pause Judge Murphy’s order, which would allow them to send the deportees on to South Sudan. The Supreme Court did not act immediately, and instead gave the deportees’ legal team until June 4 to reply.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>ICE Detains High School Student:</strong> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/nyregion/new-york-student-arrested-ice.html">detention of a 20-year-old Venezuelan at an N.Y.C. courthouse</a> appears to be the first reported instance of immigration officials apprehending a student in the city this year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Countering ICE in Nashville:</strong> With little official recourse in the liberal enclave, several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/americas/ice-nashville-volunteers.html">Nashville residents and immigration advocacy groups are now acting as an unofficial warning system</a> when Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE agents have been spotted together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crackdown on Aid</strong>: Republicans&#39; aggressive attempt to curb immigrant families’ use of safety net programs would largely be felt by children who are U.S. citizens but whose parents are undocumented or immigrants, say immigration experts and advocates for immigrant rights.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Decision to Leave</strong>: Yessica Rojas, a Venezuelan mother, risked everything to seek a better future for her two children in the United States. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/americas/mother-self-deportation-trump.html">This spring, they left Missouri because she feared losing them.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Seeking Return of Guatemalan Man to U.S.:</strong> A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of the man, known by the initials O.C.G., who had been deported to Mexico, despite fearing persecution and having told U.S. authorities about the violence he had experienced there. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/politics/trump-deportation-court-mexico.html">O.C.G. is gay and is now living in hiding in Guatemala</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Sanctuary’ Policies:</strong> The Justice Department has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/new-jersey-sanctuary-city-lawsuit.html">sued four New Jersey cities and their leaders</a> over the policies, which federal lawyers say are hindering the Trump administration’s enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia:</strong> Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador set off a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-abrego-garcia-el-salvador-deportation.html">fierce debate among officials in three cabinet agencies</a>, despite agreement there had been a mistake.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
