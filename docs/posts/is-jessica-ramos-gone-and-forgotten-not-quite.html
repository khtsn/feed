But on Sunday, the parade through Manhattan was a stage for Cuomo and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the two leading Democratic candidates, to showcase their latest endorsement prizes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For Cuomo, that meant walking with Ramos, a state senator, who somehow got past her long-held disdain of Cuomo to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/nyregion/jessica-ramos-endorse-cuomo.html" title="">throw her support behind him</a> days earlier. She released a <a href="https://x.com/jessicaramosqns/status/1931857071299035386?s=61" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign-style video</a> after the parade, but not on her own behalf. Instead, she told viewers that “we’re going to have a great summer with a brand-new mayor,” as the video cut to images of Cuomo.</p><p>For Mamdani, it meant appearing with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who gave him her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/nyregion/aoc-endorse-mamdani-mayor.html" title="">coveted top endorsement</a>, and Representative Nydia Velázquez, who <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1932137501512147004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsed him as well</a>. Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez rode atop a float decked out with palm trees, the two enthusiastically waving Puerto Rican flags.</p><p>With the start of early voting just four days away, the crowded Democratic primary seems to be narrowing to a two-person contest between Cuomo and Mamdani. Their rivals have one last debate, on Thursday, to try to flip the script, or at least widen it to allow for an alternate ending.</p><p>It likely won’t be easy. But some potential attack lines may be found in some of our recent coverage. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/mamdani-age-mayor-young.html" title="">we delved</a> into how Mamdani’s youth appeals to some voters, but his inexperience concerns others.

If so, hopefully he’ll arrive at a better fate than his would-be historical predecessor. Nick Fandos has more.</em></p><p>In 1913, as the world slid toward war, New York City elected the second-youngest mayor in its history. At 34 years and 5 months, John Purroy Mitchel was considered so youthful his fellow New Yorkers called him the “boy mayor.”</p><p>Mamdani, who would be almost three months younger on Inauguration Day, would probably prefer to skip the moniker. But he could do worse than emulating Mitchel — up to a point.</p><p>Like this year’s candidate, Mitchel was educated in the Bronx (Fordham Prep vs. Mamdani’s alma mater, the Bronx High School of Science), ran as an anti-establishment reformer (against Tammany Hall) and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1913/02/06/archives/mitchel-hailed-as-the-next-mayor-but-president-of-aldermen-says.html" title="">highly focused on transit</a> issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Some historians consider Mitchel the city’s first Hispanic mayor because he descended from Spanish nobility. Mamdani is hoping to be its first South Asian mayor.</p><p>The city’s youngest mayor, Hugh J. Grant, was believed to be 30 when he took the oath of office in 1889, though historians have struggled to pin down his exact birth date.</p><p>Cuomo would also make history, if elected, but for the opposite reason. He would be <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook-pm/2025/02/28/zohran-mamdani-is-surging-for-mayor-cuomo-poll-second-00206735" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the oldest man</a> known to take the oath of office as mayor of New York, besting Abraham D. Beame by a few months.</p><p>As for Mitchel, his life took a tragic turn. After losing re-election in 1917, he signed up as an officer in the Army Air Service as the war raged in Europe. He was flying a training mission in Louisiana in July 1918 when <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/07/07/98268429.html?pageNumber=1" title="">he fell 500 feet to his death</a>.</p><p>Authorities blamed an unfastened seatbelt.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ramos criticized the Working Families Party, which she said had strayed from its mission of representing the working class.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Cenicola/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-31ef38b1">A few questions with Jessica Ramos</h2><p>So this is awkward.</p><p>We invited the nine leading Democratic candidates to be interviewed at The Times. We’ve run five of the interviews so far, and the exchanges have offered broad insight on everything from the candidates’ views about the most important issues facing New York City to their favorite breakfast orders. (Yes, Cuomo did say bacon, cheese and egg on an English muffin. It’s not a B.E.C. Maybe it’s a B-CEEM. Who knows.)</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-interview.html" title="">latest installment appeared this morning</a>, with Mamdani explaining why his favorite mayor of his lifetime was Bill de Blasio.</p><p>We interviewed Ramos before her bombshell decision to endorse Cuomo. The move essentially eliminated her from contention, making the interview both less relevant and outdated. (She told us that she couldn’t think of any issue where she’s changed her mind. Days later, she changed her mind on Cuomo.)</p><p>We still appreciate that she spent time with us, so we’re excerpting her responses here.</p><p><strong>Why has it been so difficult to qualify for matching funds?</strong></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>I don’t have a rich network. I have constituents, friends and community that are also struggling to get by in New York City, and so without institutional support from any party or any particular industry, it’s increasingly difficult.</p><p><strong>Could you talk about your relationship with the Working Families Party? You said you didn’t really feel welcome at one of their rallies.</strong></p><p>I have given the Working Families Party many of my years and lots of my activism and my volunteer hours, and it was disappointing to me not to be supported by the Working Families Party. I work for people who clock in and clock out every day. That’s who I legislate for. I don’t know that that’s who they represent.</p><p><strong>What’s your bagel order or favorite breakfast sandwich?</strong></p><p>An everything bagel with cream cheese, lox, capers and red onions.</p><p><strong>Why don’t you seem to like or support Assemblyman Mamdani?</strong></p><p>I appreciate his voice. I wish he was a harder worker. I believe in the last four years in the Senate, I’ve delivered a tremendous body of legislation, and I believe that anybody who should be mayor of the City of New York should have a legislative record to match. What good is it to be there everyday and accomplish so little?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>I don’t think anybody who went to prep school is my savior.

Now, he said he was looking for a “barrier” to protect New York City from President Trump.</p><p>“My view is that it is especially important to have a strong person who can lead the public and resist whatever demands are made of us,” he said. “I think that is Governor Cuomo.”</p><p>He said he believed Cuomo would be the opposite of Mayor Eric Adams, who “owes his freedom to President Trump.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>Abrams, 88, grew up in Queens and lives on the Upper East Side.
