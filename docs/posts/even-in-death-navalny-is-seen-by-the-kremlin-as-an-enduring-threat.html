Navalny died in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/world/europe/navalny-health-prison-death.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">a Russian prison</a> above the Arctic Circle, Konstantin A. Kotov woke up to find his Moscow apartment under siege.</p><p>After breaking down the door, Russian officers set about confiscating everything to do with Mr. Navalny, down to a campaign button from the activist’s 2018 presidential run and a book written by his brother. Then, they arrested Mr. Kotov and took him away.</p><p>His alleged crime: donating approximately $30 three years earlier to Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund, which the Kremlin considers an extremist group.</p><p>The death one year ago of Mr. Navalny, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/world/europe/thousands-protest-in-moscow-russia-in-defiance-of-putin.html" title="">who once led tens of thousands of Russians against the Kremlin on the streets of Moscow</a>, dealt a serious blow to Russia’s already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/world/europe/navalny-russia-opposition-divided.html" title="">beleaguered opposition</a>. Much of that movement has fled abroad amid a crackdown on dissent that began before President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but escalated with the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Even with Mr. Navalny dead and his movement in tatters, the authorities have been going after people with links to him and his organization inside Russia. Some see the continued prosecutions as a repressive Russian machine operating on autopilot. Others see a Moscow that views the opposition figure’s legacy as an enduring threat.</p><p>“They seem to be doing it more out of habit, rather than as a new campaign,” said Sergei S. Smirnov, the editor in chief of the exiled media outlet Mediazona.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 2021 march in Moscow in support of Mr. Navalny, who then was in prison.

The court ruled that it was tantamount to “participating” in Mr. Navalny’s illegal movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Navalny’s lawyers insisted they were being tried for routine legal work that includes passing on communications on behalf of imprisoned clients.</p><p>Cases seeking to punish ordinary Russians for making donations to Mr. Navalny’s team, some of them as paltry as $3, have also cropped up in courts.</p><p>Russian authorities have prosecuted at least 15 people on charges of funding an extremist organization for sending donations to Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund. In the past few months, local media reported such charges against a physician from Biysk, an IT engineer from a St. Petersburg suburb and a political activist from Ufa.</p><p>“These are simply people who maybe just transferred 500 rubles a long time ago to the Anti-Corruption Fund,” Mr. Kotov, a wiry 39-year-old activist who works for a human rights organization, said, referring to a sum that is a little over $5. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>By the time a donation case was opened against him, Mr. Kotov had long been on the radar of Russian authorities for rallying against Kremlin abuses.</p><p>In 2019, he was one of the first people to be arrested under a new Russian law restricting freedom of assembly at “unsanctioned protests.” (The law laid the groundwork for a near total protest ban that later helped pacify wartime Russia.)</p><p>He spent 18 months in prison, most of it at a harsh facility in Russia’s Vladimir region, about 60 miles east of Moscow.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Kotov’s release, Mr. Navalny returned to Russia, having recovered abroad in Germany from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-poisoning-water-bottle-russia.html" title="">a near-fatal poisoning</a>. Within weeks, Mr. Navalny would end up in the same prison where Mr. Kotov had been jailed.</p><p>That year, a Russian court outlawed and liquidated Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund, labeling it extremist. The ruling criminalized fund-raising from ordinary Russians that for years had kept the group afloat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Navalny’s top aides took to YouTube and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynyeletJwsM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made an urgent plea</a> for donations to keep the organization alive, saying they had worked out a secure system for supporters to transfer funds to a bank account outside Russia.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Konstantin A.

He signed up to give a 500 ruble donation per month, believing the new platform was secure.</p><p>“It was my gesture to show that I didn’t agree with the liquidation of the Anti-Corruption Fund and that I supported Aleksei Navalny, who was in prison,” Mr. Kotov said. “I wanted his activities to continue.”</p><p>Half a year later, in January 2022, Mr. Kotov got nervous and stopped the donations. But by then, it was too late. Some of the transactions had revealed the Anti-Corruption Fund’s foreign bank information to Russian authorities by including a reference to the group’s name in the transfer data. The donations had not been secure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The following month, Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine, prompting Mr. Kotov to go out in the streets of Moscow and protest the war. He was quickly arrested and spent the next month in jail. Two and a half years later, the authorities came to his apartment and arrested him for the six 500 ruble donations he made to the Mr. Navalny’s fund. He pleaded guilty.</p><p>A court released him under house arrest. At first, he thought he would stay in Russia. Other donors charged with the same crime had gotten away with fines.</p><p>But then, in December, a court in Moscow <a href="https://t.me/moscowcourts/5570" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> Ivan S. Tishchenko, a 46-year-old heart surgeon, guilty for sending 3,500 rubles in donations to Mr. Navalny’s foundation. His sentence: four years in prison.</p><p>Dr. Tishchenko had subscribed to recurring donations to the Anti-Corruption Fund well before Russian authorities outlawed it as extremist in 2021.</p><p>Dr. Tishchenko’s lawyer, Natalya Tikhonova, <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/24/12/2024/676ae45b9a79473aa5f787c3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> the verdict as “too harsh for a person who saved thousands of lives and definitely never intended to cause any harm to Russia’s constitutional order.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Kotov, wary of a return to Russian prison, fled to Lithuania this year.</p><p>In an interview from there, Mr. Kotov described how Mr. Navalny had represented hope “that Putin isn’t immortal, that at some point this regime will come to an end.”</p><p>“Aleksei Navalny was the symbol of a beautiful Russia of the future, a happy Russia of the future,” he said. “When that symbol was gone, I started to feel much worse.”</p><p>“But we’re still living,” he added. “We can’t give up.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Paul Sonne is an international correspondent, focusing on Russia and the varied impacts of President Vladimir V.
