It was not clear on Thursday whether the Israeli delegation was playing for time or had a serious mandate to bridge the yawning gaps between the two sides.</p><p>The uncertainty has left both Israelis and Palestinians in limbo about the fate of more hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and whether fighting could soon restart.</p><p>“Our only hope is that the cease-fire continues,” said Shamekh al-Dibs, a 36-year-old living in a school-turned-shelter since his home in northern Gaza was destroyed. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For now, the first six-week phase of the cease-fire is set to conclude without a clear framework to take its place. That does not necessarily mean an immediate return to war: The agreement says the truce can continue as long as negotiators are working on the next steps. But it makes the already fragile deal more precarious.</p><p>Israeli government officials did not provide details about the delegation’s trip to Cairo, and extending the deal would entail tackling much thornier issues than hostage and prisoner releases, such as a permanent end to the war and the reconstruction of Gaza.</p><p>Under the terms of the phased agreement, Israel would effectively have to declare an end to its war against Hamas in order to secure the release of some two dozen hostages believed to still be alive.</p><p>For the families of Israeli captives, the prospect of their loved ones’ release is both closer than ever before and agonizingly distant. They are well aware that formidable obstacles remain to securing their freedom given the lack of an agreement on the future of the deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“By Sunday, we’ll be in no man’s land,” said Adi Alexander, whose American-Israeli son, Edan Alexander, has been held in Gaza for more than 500 days. “It was left blurry on purpose, and it’s still blurry,” he said of this element of the cease-fire agreement.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adi and Yael Alexander, the parents of Edan Alexander, at home in Tenafly, N.J., last year.

Instead, they committed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-what-we-know.html" title="">a complex, multiphase plan</a> meant to slowly build momentum toward a comprehensive cease-fire after more than a year of devastating fighting in Gaza.</p><p>The first stage was intended to stop the fighting while the two sides hashed out a larger settlement.</p><p>Hamas released 30 Israeli and foreign hostages and handed over the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel. It was a rocky process, involving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-bodies.html" title="">staged hostage transfers</a> that Israel described as humiliating, and that almost derailed the entire deal.</p><p>Israel and Hamas remain as distant as ever on their core demands.</p><p>Israel has vowed it will not end the war permanently until Hamas is no longer in control of Gaza and the territory is demilitarized. Hamas has mostly refused to consider disbanding its armed battalions or sending its leaders into exile.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy, has floated the idea of extending the first phase by continuing to swap hostages for prisoners.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Welcoming a released Palestinian prisoners in Ramallah in the West Bank this month.

He said Israel had dragged its feet on opening negotiations for the second phase.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu faces considerable pressure from within his own government not to conclusively end the war. His political allies say they want to keep fighting Hamas and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers.html" title="">build Jewish settlements in Gaza</a>.</p><p>Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel is set to begin withdrawing forces from Gaza’s border with Egypt over the weekend. But Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he views Israeli control of the area as a core security interest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Both Israel and Hamas have reasons to avoid a resumption of the war.</p><p>Hamas wants to give its forces a chance to recuperate and begin rebuilding Gaza. Israel wants to bring home the remaining hostages. Of the roughly 250 taken during the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023, the Israeli government believes about 25 are still alive. Israel also wants to recover the bodies of roughly 30 others.</p><p>But the prospect of renewed fighting has never really gone away. Many Israelis, particularly on the right, say they cannot countenance ending the war with Hamas still ruling Gaza. For now, Hamas appears to have given little ground on the question.</p><p>Mr. Alexander, whose son was abducted from an Israeli military post, said he was optimistic the truce could hold.</p><p>“Nobody wants this war to restart again — not Israel, not the United States. I definitely don’t think Hamas wants it,” he said.</p><p>But the Israeli government should “put the hostages up front, let this country heal, and think about Hamas later,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinians have been welcoming home prisoners freed by Israel as part of the agreement. Scores were serving life sentences for involvement in planning and carrying out militant attacks, including bombings that killed Israeli civilians. Many others were detained during Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza and held without any formal charges. </p><p>Some Palestinians were also expelled abroad as part of the agreement and not allowed to return to their homes in the West Bank. Their families hope to meet them in Egypt, but at least some say that Israel has not allowed them to leave the West Bank in the meantime. </p><p>Alaa Abu Hmeid, whose husband, Nasr, was sentenced to five life terms for carrying out attacks against Israelis during the Second Intifada, said she tried to travel to Jordan to see her freed husband, only to be turned back by the Israeli authorities. </p><p>“Their dream of breathing fresh air is finally coming true, at least in part,” she said. “But we still feel stuck in limbo.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
