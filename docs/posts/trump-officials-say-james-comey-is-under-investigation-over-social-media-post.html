Weeks before the 2020 election, Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/10/19/8645-meaning-whitmer-trump/3708927001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seized on a pin that said “86 45”</a> that could be seen on a table behind Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan during a TV interview. Asserting that “86 can be shorthand for killing someone,” the Trump campaign accused Ms. Whitmer of <a href="https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1317887947304280071" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“encouraging assassination attempts against President Trump.”</a></p><p>After President Joseph R. Biden Jr. took office, clothing and signs with “86 46,” referring to Mr. Biden, soon began to appear and <a href="https://www.dukesdecals.com/products/86-46-done-with-joe-biden-t-shirt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continue to be sold online.</a> During the 2024 campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/30/us/politics/trump-biden-image.html" title="">Mr. Trump posted a video featuring an image of Mr. Biden hog-tied on the back of a truck</a>, imagery that had spread among Mr. Trump’s followers.
