They deserve to get rest.”</p><p>The skulls were taken in the summer of 1873 by three researchers working for the Karolinska Institute, a medical university in Sweden, who dug up graves in four communities in Finland. They returned to Sweden with human remains from the exhumations and measured and studied them. For decades until 2015, human remains taken by researchers were housed in <a href="https://ki.se/en/about-ki/history-and-cultural-heritage/ki-and-the-legacy-of-anders-and-gustaf-retzius" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">various Swedish institutions</a> before being returned to Karolinska.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Since then, the university has been researching the origins of some of the remains and repatriating them.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“This is a handshake with the past,” the local cultural coordinator said of the remains’ return.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juho Kuva for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Sunday, under clear blue skies and balmy temperatures, residents of Palkane gathered to watch the return of the skulls to the church — which has been in ruins for centuries — from which they had been taken in 1873.</p><p>As a military band played, the skulls arrived in a horse-drawn carriage driven by people in old-fashioned clothing. Four men carried each coffin before lowering it into a grave. Some community members cast dirt and sand over the graves.</p><p>“People feel that they are participating in something meaningful,” said Marketta Pyysalo, the cultural coordinator for Palkane. “This is a handshake with the past.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Most of the skulls brought back to Palkane were probably buried between the 1500s and the 1800s, said Ulla Moilanen, an archaeologist at the University of Turku. But their identities remain unknown, and she hopes to analyze DNA samples she had taken from the skulls to find out more about them.</p><p>“When we find out more about these people, their lives, they really become part of history, not just as skulls, but as human beings,” she said.</p><p>Hanna-Liisa Anttila, 90, whose family is from elsewhere in Finland and who came to the ceremony dressed in a national costume, said it was possible the ancestors of her husband, who is from Palkane, might be among the taken skulls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hanna-Liisa Anttila, whose husband is from Palkane, said she wondered whether his ancestors might be among the remains that were taken.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juho Kuva for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>She said the remains’ removal was a “desecration” of the graves.</p><p>The Swedish researchers who exhumed the graves wondered whether Finns were a different race from Swedes, noting that the Finnish language is more closely related to Estonian and Hungarian than Swedish, and believed that an examination of the skulls would answer their questions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>For many people in Finland, those questions about whether they are a different race sounded a lot like an effort to prove that they were an inferior one.</p><p>“They kind of wanted to put us down and thought maybe that they could do whatever they like with our skulls and remains,” Ms. Pikka said, “that those people weren’t important.”</p><p>Many said the research on the Finnish skulls made them think of eugenics, a discredited scientific theory that was used to justify atrocities including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/08/arts/design/the-tainted-science-of-nazi-atrocities.html" title="">the Holocaust in Nazi Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/magazine/eugenics-movement-america.html" title="">segregation in the United States</a> and the forced sterilization of people in <a href="https://nordics.info/show/artikel/eugenics-in-the-nordic-countries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sweden and Finland</a> and other Nordic nations, and countries including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/magazine/eugenics-movement-america.html" title="">United States</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pauliina Pikka, a local official, at the reinterment ceremony on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juho Kuva for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Research developed down this rabbit hole of physical measurements to try to prove the superiority of one race over another,” said Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen, a professor of Scandinavian and comparative literature at University College London.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It had a huge international following,” added Dr. Stougaard-Nielsen, who chaired a 2021 seminar titled <a href="https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk/Play/67676" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Legacy of Eugenics in Scandinavia.”</a></p><p>In 1921, Sweden’s Parliament <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/news/2021/2021-12-13-deliberate-campaign-behind-racial-biology-in-uppsala" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">established the State Institute for Racial Biology</a>, where scientists tried to prove differences among races and track what they saw as the “degeneration” of Sweden’s gene pool.
