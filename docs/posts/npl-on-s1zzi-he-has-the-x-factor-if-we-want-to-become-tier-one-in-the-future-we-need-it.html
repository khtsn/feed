                  <p><strong>Commmiserations for being eliminated from the tournament. Can you tell me your first reaction to the result and to the run you&#39;ve had here in Cluj?</strong></p>
                  <p>I don&#39;t know what to say, actually, because we played very bad. Bad mid-round decisions, bad calls, in my opinion, so we weren&#39;t able to show our game.</p>
                  <p><strong>Does it feel like a missed opportunity after yesterday you were close to beating The MongolZ and that you had more in you in some of these matches?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think we had a chance. I can say that some players or the whole team didn&#39;t want to fix mistakes during the tournament, and every game we just played like we did before, making the same mistakes, so it was very hard to play.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Can you tell me about s1zzi? It was your first tournament with him as your new AWPer. What did you think about how he handled this kind of competition, in his first time at this level?</strong></p>
                  <p>He&#39;s a very good player. As I said before, he wasn&#39;t able to show his performance because we were making bad decisions and bad calls, and we couldn&#39;t do our strats, so it was impossible for him to do anything. But, actually, he&#39;s a very good player, and talented.</p>
                  <p><strong>How different is he to headtr1ck and how will he impact the team&#39;s playstyle in the future?</strong></p>
                  <p>Obviously, he has that X-factor. That&#39;s what every tier-one team needs, and if we want to become a tier-one team in the future, we need it.</p>
