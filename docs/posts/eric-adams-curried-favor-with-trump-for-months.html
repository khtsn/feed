    <h1>Eric Adams Curried Favor With Trump for Months</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before the Department of Justice instructed federal prosecutors to drop the charges against him, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, had spent months making overtures to President Trump, a Republican. Now Mr. Trump has helped deliver the mayor a legal reprieve less than a month into his term, a stunning gesture in a political dalliance that has confounded many Democrats and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/nyregion/adams-trump-republican.html" title="">even some Republicans</a>.</p><p>Mr. Adams has declined to criticize Mr. Trump or his policies and has signaled a desire to work with the new administration. On Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-trump-nyc-officials-cooperation.html" title="">he encouraged senior city officials to follow</a> his lead, warning that criticizing the Trump administration could jeopardize federal funding for the city.</p><p>During the presidential campaign, Mr. Adams <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/embattled-mayor-adams-says-hes-voting-for-kamala-harris-as-he-enters-polling-site-one-day-after-bizarrely-refusing-to-say-her-name/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eventually acknowledged</a> that he planned to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, but he also occasionally defended Mr. Trump, saying he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-fascist-mayor-adams.html" title="">should not be described as “fascist”</a> or likened to Hitler. Mr. Adams was a registered Republican in the 1990s.</p><p>After the election, Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/875-24/transcript-mayor-adams-holds-in-person-media-availability" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed his enthusiasm for the billionaire Elon Musk</a>, one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent boosters and the president’s pick to lead a new government cost-cutting initiative. In December, the mayor also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html" title="">met with the president’s so-called border czar</a>, Thomas D. Homan, who had been tapped to oversee a crackdown on illegal immigration. Mr. Adams said that he and Mr. Homan shared “the same desire” to detain undocumented immigrants who commit crimes in New York City.</p></div></div>
