Now Mr. Trump has helped deliver the mayor a legal reprieve less than a month into his term, a stunning gesture in a political dalliance that has confounded many Democrats and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/nyregion/adams-trump-republican.html" title="">even some Republicans</a>.</p><p>Mr. Adams has declined to criticize Mr. Trump or his policies and has signaled a desire to work with the new administration. On Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-trump-nyc-officials-cooperation.html" title="">he encouraged senior city officials to follow</a> his lead, warning that criticizing the Trump administration could jeopardize federal funding for the city.</p><p>During the presidential campaign, Mr. Adams <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/us-news/embattled-mayor-adams-says-hes-voting-for-kamala-harris-as-he-enters-polling-site-one-day-after-bizarrely-refusing-to-say-her-name/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eventually acknowledged</a> that he planned to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, but he also occasionally defended Mr. Trump, saying he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-fascist-mayor-adams.html" title="">should not be described as “fascist”</a> or likened to Hitler. Mr. Adams was a registered Republican in the 1990s.</p><p>After the election, Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/875-24/transcript-mayor-adams-holds-in-person-media-availability" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed his enthusiasm for the billionaire Elon Musk</a>, one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent boosters and the president’s pick to lead a new government cost-cutting initiative. In December, the mayor also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html" title="">met with the president’s so-called border czar</a>, Thomas D. Homan, who had been tapped to oversee a crackdown on illegal immigration. Mr. Adams said that he and Mr. Homan shared “the same desire” to detain undocumented immigrants who commit crimes in New York City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And then, just days before the president’s inauguration, Mr. Adams made a surprise visit to Florida, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/nyregion/adams-trump-mar-a-lago.html" title="">dining with Mr. Trump</a> near his Mar-a-Lago compound. The mayor described the meeting as “productive.” He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/nyregion/adams-trump-inauguration.html" title="">accepted an 11th-hour invitation</a> to attend the inauguration, skipping two events he had been scheduled to attend in New York City to honor Martin Luther King’s Birthday. At one of the events, Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, called Mr. Adams’s decision “disturbing.”</p><p>For his part, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/nyregion/trump-pardon-eric-adams.html?smid=url-share" title="">said that Mr. Adams was being treated “pretty unfairly”</a> in his criminal case and likened the mayor’s legal woes to his own. When Mr. Adams was indicted in September, Mr. Trump came to his defense almost immediately, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/trump-adams-indictments-analysis.html" title="">suggesting without evidence</a> that the mayor had been <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-claims-predicted-adams-indicted-comments-migrants/story?id=114221281" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">targeted because he criticized the Biden administration</a> and its immigration policies.</p><p>The two men found themselves ringside at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event at Madison Square Garden less than two weeks after Mr. Trump’s election. They “exchanged pleasantries” for less than 30 seconds, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/19/eric-adams-donald-trump-discussion-00190516" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Adams said at a news conference</a> a few days later.</p><p>According to Mr. Adams’s account of the interaction, Mr. Trump also praised his leadership and described him as “one of the greatest mayors the city has ever had.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
