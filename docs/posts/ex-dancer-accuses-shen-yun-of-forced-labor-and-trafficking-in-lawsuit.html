She performed with the group until she left in 2020, when she was 24.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Chang sued under a federal law that allows victims of forced labor to bring lawsuits against their traffickers.</p><p>The lawsuit comes three months after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/shen-yun-dance-abuse.html" title="">The New York Times revealed that Shen Yun’s performers</a> had been working in abusive conditions for years. Ms. Chang, now 28, was among the former performers and instructors quoted in the article.</p><p>The New York State Department of Labor has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/nyregion/shen-yun-child-labor-regulator.html" title="">opened an inquiry</a> into the company’s labor practices, including its use of child performers, The Times reported last week.</p><p>The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. Ms. Chang is the only named plaintiff, but she is seeking to certify the lawsuit as a class action.</p><p>Shen Yun, which performed more than 800 times on five continents in its most recent tour, puts on a two-hour dance and music show that spreads the message of Falun Gong, a religious movement that is banned in China and has been persecuted by the Chinese government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Representatives of Shen Yun and Falun Gong did not immediately provide a comment on Monday. They have previously denied violating any laws and said labor laws did not apply to their underage performers because they are students who tour with Shen Yun as a learning opportunity, not employees. Every student participates in Shen Yun voluntarily, they have said.</p><p>“Sure, some people leave because it’s not for them, and that’s perfectly fine,” Shen Yun’s representatives said in a recent statement. “But the vast majority of students will tell you this is their dream come true, and the parents rave about the positive changes in their children.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicole Hong is an investigative reporter, focused on covering New York and its surrounding regions.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicole-hong">More about Nicole Hong</a></span></p></div><div><p>Michael Rothfeld is an investigative reporter in New York, writing in-depth stories focused on the city’s government, business and personalities.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-rothfeld">More about Michael Rothfeld</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
