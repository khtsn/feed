data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Israeli airstrikes hit two buildings in a densely populated area of central Beirut on Thursday, Lebanon said, in what appeared to be the deadliest attack in the Lebanese capital in more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.</p><p>The strikes killed at least at least 22 people and wounded at least 117 others, Lebanese officials said.</p><p>Lebanon’s state-run news agency reported that one of the strikes had targeted the middle of an eight-story building in the Ras el-Nabaa neighborhood, while the other had leveled a four-story building in the Basta neighborhood. Videos verified by The New York Times showed that the building in Basta had been destroyed and adjacent buildings had been damaged. Two plumes of thick, acrid smoke could be seen rising above the city skyline.</p><p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strikes. But it has been systematically targeting Hezbollah leaders and sites in a heavy bombing campaign in areas in and around Beirut and in a ground invasion in southern Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The strikes came hours after United Nations officials said that Israeli forces had fired on U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, wounding two and touching off international criticism of the Israeli military’s offensive against Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group.</p><p>The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/world/middleeast/unifil-un-peacekeepers-lebanon.html" title="">known by its acronym, UNIFIL</a>, said the two soldiers, from Indonesia, had been injured when an Israeli tank fired toward and directly hit an observation tower at the force’s headquarters in Naqoura, Lebanon.</p><p>At a separate base nearby, the U.N. force said, Israeli soldiers fired at the entrance of a bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and communications equipment.</p><p>The U.N. mission condemned the strikes, saying in a <a href="https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-statement-10-october" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that “any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Southern Lebanon on Thursday after strikes seen from northern Israel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ammar Awad/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Israeli military said on Thursday that Israeli troops operating in the Naqoura area, next to a UNIFIL base, had instructed the U.N. forces in the area to move to “protected spaces,” and then “opened fire in the area.” The military said that Hezbollah “operates from within and near civilian areas in southern Lebanon, including areas near UNIFIL posts.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hezbollah has used southern Lebanon as a staging ground for rocket and drone attacks on Israel for more than a year, beginning right after its ally Hamas led an assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p><p>Last month, Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, blowing up pagers and walkie-talkies used by the group’s members and launching airstrikes that killed its leader and other top commanders, as well as many civilians. Israeli ground troops have since invaded southern Lebanon and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">battled</a> Hezbollah’s fighters in deadly, <a href="https://t.me/idfofficial/11051" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close-range combat</a>.</p><p>Since 1978, UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which has more than <a href="https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-troop-contributing-countries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10,000</a> civilian and military personnel from 50 countries, has had the task of maintaining peace along a volatile 75-mile stretch of territory called the Blue Line, the de facto border to which Israel withdrew after ending its occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000.</p><p>Although the peacekeepers are armed, their mission is largely observational, and they are generally restricted to using force only when their safety or the safety of civilians is immediately threatened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The United States and Israel have argued that the peacekeepers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/world/middleeast/united-nations-security-council-peacekeepers-lebanon-hezbollah-israel.html?timespastHighlight=UNIFIL" title="">largely ineffective at preventing Hezbollah</a> from stockpiling weapons and firing into Israel.

Iranian state television footage showed the structure had been destroyed and firefighters were hosing down the flames. The hospital had 56 beds, state television said, adding that Iranian Red Crescent workers were safe.</p><p>Amid anticipation of an Israeli response to an Iranian barrage of nearly 200 missiles last week, Israel’s security cabinet met on Thursday night, officials said. The cabinet was expected to authorize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, to initiate the response at their discretion, the officials said.</p><p>Mr. Gallant posted a video on Wednesday saying that Israel’s attack against Iran would be “deadly, precise and, above all, surprising.” He added: “They will not understand what happened and how it happened. They will see the results.”</p><p>President Biden has urged Mr. Netanyahu not to hit Iran’s nuclear or energy sites, which the White House fears could lead to an escalating cycle of Iranian missile strikes and Israeli reprisals.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- -->, <!-- -->Elisabetta Povoledo<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aurelien Breeden<!-- -->, <!-- -->Farnaz Fassihi<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ephrat Livni<!-- -->, <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> and <!-- -->Eve Sampson<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 10, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed the source of a statement about the nature of two peacekeepers’ injuries.
