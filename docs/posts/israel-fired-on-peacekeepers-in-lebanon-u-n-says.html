While other troops have been injured since last October, when Hezbollah and the Israeli military started increasingly trading cross-border fire, the recent cases have been more serious and have raised alarm.</p><p>Hezbollah exercises de facto control over much of southern Lebanon, and Israeli officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/12/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war-news?smid=url-share#un-peacekeepers-are-facing-increased-attacks-along-the-israel-lebanon-border" title="">repeatedly criticized UNIFIL</a> for failing to deter the group’s operations in that part of the country. The U.N. force has said that its <a href="https://unifil.unmissions.org/faqs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">powers as a peacekeeping operation</a> are inherently limited.</p><p>Hezbollah has been sending rockets into Israel since last October in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza.

The country’s defense minister, Guido Crosetto, said at a news conference on Thursday that “the hostile acts committed and repeated by Israeli forces” against the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force “could constitute war crimes.” He called the acts “serious violations of the norms of international law, not justified by any military reason.”</p><p>Mr. Crosetto also said in a <a href="https://www.difesa.it/eng/primo-piano/lebanon-italian-soldiers-are-safe-minister-crosetto-protests-to-israeli-defence-minister-gallant-israeli-ambassador-to-italy-summoned/57189.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> that he had summoned the Israeli ambassador to protest what is happening in southern Lebanon, particularly at the Italian bases, and called it “totally unacceptable.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Spain said that firing at U.N. peacekeepers was a “grave violation” of international law. France, which last month put forward a proposal for a 21-day pause in the fighting, condemned “any threat to UNIFIL’s security.”</p><p>“The protection of peacekeepers is an obligation imposed on all parties to a conflict,” the French foreign ministry said in a statement. “France calls on the parties to respect this obligation.”</p><p>Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, said in a statement from his office on Thursday: “Our recommendation is that UNIFIL relocate five kilometers north to avoid danger as fighting intensifies and while the situation along the Blue Line remains volatile as a result of Hezbollah’s aggression.”</p><p>He added that “Israel has no desire to be in Lebanon, but it will do what is necessary” to force Hezbollah away from its northern border so that some 70,000 residents could return to their homes in northern Israel.</p><p>The strike in central Beirut on Thursday hit a densely populated area that houses people recently displaced from south Lebanon and the Dahiya and Bekaa. At least one building was destroyed, according to news reports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>An Israeli strike also killed at least five members of the country’s civil defense agency overnight, according to Lebanon’s health ministry and state news media. The strike hit a base of operations where the emergency workers were waiting to respond to relief calls, said Elie Khairallah, a spokesman for the agency.</p><p>He said the agency’s regional chief was among those killed and that the building, near a church in the southern Lebanese town of Derdghaiya, was leveled in the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescuers searching for survivors at a civil defense base in southern Lebanon early on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Kashmar/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Lebanon’s health ministry condemned the killings, accusing the Israeli military of targeting ambulance crews and rescue teams.
