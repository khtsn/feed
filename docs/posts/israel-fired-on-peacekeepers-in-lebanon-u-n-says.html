Israeli ground troops have since invaded southern Lebanon and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">battled its</a> fighters in deadly and <a href="https://t.me/idfofficial/11051" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close combat</a>.</p><p>More than 2,000 people have been killed since the conflict has escalated, according to the Lebanese health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.</p><p>On Thursday, Israeli airstrikes hit central Beirut, the Lebanese capital, the health ministry said, killing at least 22 people and wounding 117 others. The strikes hit a densely populated area that also houses people recently displaced from south Lebanon, other neighborhoods near the capital and the Bekaa Valley. At least one building was destroyed, videos verified by The New York Times showed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Iran’s Red Crescent Society said that Israel had bombed its field hospital on the border between Lebanon and Syria. Iranian state television footage showed the structure had been completely destroyed and firefighters were hosing down the flames. The hospital had 56 beds, state television said, adding that Iranian Red Crescent workers were safe.</p><p>The Israeli attacks occurred at the same time as Israeli military activity in the Gaza Strip has appeared to intensify, prompting alarm from U.N. officials about the worsening humanitarian situation in the enclave and the danger to civilians. The death toll in Gaza has passed 42,000, the Gazan health ministry says, and 98,000 others have been injured.</p><p>On Thursday, the United Nations agency for children, UNICEF, said that an airstrike on a school in central Gaza killed women and children who were lining up for malnutrition treatment.</p><p>“This attack serves as yet another stark reminder of the immense toll being inflicted on children and mothers in Gaza,” Adele Khodr, UNICEF’s director for the Middle East and North Africa, <a href="https://x.com/AdeleKhodr/status/1844413428489748962" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>, noting that two health workers from a partner agency had also been killed in the strike.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians searching for missing people under the rubble of a destroyed school building on Thursday in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohammed Saber/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The Israeli military said on Thursday that its troops and Air Force had struck militants operating a command center in a former school compound in Gaza and that “numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk to civilians.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Amid anticipation of an Israeli response to an Iranian barrage of nearly 200 ballistic missiles last week that sent nearly the entire country into shelters, Israel’s security cabinet was set to convene on Thursday night, officials said.</p><p>Senior ministers, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, planned to discuss the overall plan for Israel’s retaliation, said two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. The cabinet was expected to authorize Mr. Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, to initiate the response at their discretion, the officials said.</p><p>Mr. Gallant posted a video on Wednesday saying that Israel’s attack against Iran would be “deadly, precise and, above all, surprising.” He added: “They will not understand what happened and how it happened. They will see the results.”</p><p>President Biden has urged Mr. Netanyahu not to hit Iran’s nuclear or energy sites, which the White House fears could lead to an escalating cycle of Iranian missile strikes and Israeli reprisals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Since 1978, UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which has more than <a href="https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-troop-contributing-countries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10,000</a> civilian and military personnel from 50 countries, has had the task of maintaining peace along a volatile 75-mile stretch of territory called the Blue Line, the de facto border to which Israel withdrew after ending its occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000.</p><p>Although the peacekeepers are armed, their mission is largely observational and they are generally restricted to using force only when their safety or the safety of civilians are in immediate danger. The United States and Israel have argued, however, that the peacekeepers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/world/middleeast/united-nations-security-council-peacekeepers-lebanon-hezbollah-israel.html?timespastHighlight=UNIFIL" title="">largely ineffective at preventing Hezbollah</a> from stockpiling weapons in southern Lebanon and firing rockets and drones into Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>United Nations peacekeepers vehicles in southern Lebanon in August.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Karamallah Daher/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The U.N. peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon along the border with Israel have been faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/12/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war-news/un-peacekeepers-are-facing-increased-attacks-along-the-israel-lebanon-border?ogrp=ctr&amp;smid=url-share" title="">increasing attacks</a> since the conflict escalated, U.N. officials say, including Israeli machine gun fire and shelling from tanks.</p><p>The strike on Thursday deepened a rift between Israel and many U.N. member states. Several countries that contribute troops to the force, including France, Italy and Spain, criticized the Israeli military’s firing on peacekeepers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Italian defense minister, Guido Crosetto, called the actions “very serious violations of the norms of international law, not justified by any military reason.”<em> </em>Italy has one of the largest contingent of soldiers in UNIFIL.</p><p>France also expressed “its deep concern,” the foreign ministry said, adding that it was “awaiting explanations from the Israeli authorities.”</p><p>“The protection of peacekeepers is an obligation imposed on all parties to a conflict,” the ministry added in a statement. “France calls on the parties to respect this obligation.”</p><p>Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, issued a statement on Thursday calling on U.N. peacekeepers to move five kilometers north “to avoid danger as fighting intensifies” while “the situation along the Blue Line remains volatile as a result of Hezbollah’s aggression.”</p><p>He added that “Israel has no desire to be in Lebanon, but it will do what is necessary” to force Hezbollah away from its northern border so that some 70,000 residents could return to their homes in northern Israel.</p><p>Asked about the request to move, Farhan Haq, a spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said: “While we continue to assess the safety and security of our peacekeeping forces, it’s important that they also fulfill their mandate, and they are, at present, staying in their positions.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Hwaida Saad<!-- -->, <!-- -->Elisabetta Povoledo<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aurelien Breeden<!-- -->, <!-- -->Farnaz Fassihi<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ephrat Livni<!-- -->, <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- -->, <!-- -->Aric Toler<!-- --> and <!-- -->Eve Sampson<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 10, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed the source of a statement about the nature of two peacekeepers’ injuries.
