Putin over ending the war in Ukraine and re-establishing the bilateral relationship between Russia and the United States. Mr. Putin has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trump.html" title="">cast aside Mr. Trump’s calls</a> for a quick peace in Ukraine, and Russia’s airstrikes on civilian targets appear to be increasing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Video circulating on social media and verified by The New York Times showed a car exploding and catching fire outside an apartment block, sending a thick plume of smoke into the air.
