</span>&#39;s qualification, although they will continue to fight for seeding. </p>



<p>From the beginning, GIANTX&#39;s path to Paris has been simple but daunting: make the grand final or go home. Now in the lower bracket after a narrow loss to Liquid, this is the first of the three consecutive wins they need. On the other hand, an early exit for FNATIC means that while they&#39;re still guaranteed to make Champions, they&#39;ll do so as either the third or fourth seed. </p>

<p>The series kicked off on FNATIC&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530930/giantx-vs-fnatic-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr2/?game=231406&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>, where both teams opted into the standard Viper-Fade archetype that FNATIC pioneered in 2023. GIANTX got off to a hot start, forcing FNATIC&#39;s first timeout at 3-1 and their second one at 7-2 with better-laid plans in key ultimate rounds. </p>

<p>FNATIC managed to recover after the second timeout, bouncing back to a 7-5 half and drawing even at 7-7 after winning the pistol. However, GIANTX continued to outwit the kings, pulling ahead to 12-8 after a 2v3 from <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/6959/flickless">
		Flickless	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="6">

</span>&#39;s Killjoy ultimate with an aggressive Viper&#39;s Pit play. </p>

<p><em>GIANTX expertly handles Alfajer&#39;s Lockdown to win Lotus.</em></p>

<p>Flickless dominated on Viper, putting up a 26/13/12 KDA and 202 ADR to outdo an in-form Alfajer, who trailed behind at 23/15/0. </p>

<p>The second map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530930/giantx-vs-fnatic-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr2/?game=231407&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Sunset</a>, where it was FNATIC&#39;s first time showing the map in Stage 2. Once again, GIANTX led from the start, this time converting the bonus to go up 6-0. FNATIC attempted to mount a recovery, pulling it back to 6-3 and forcing a GIANTX timeout, but GIANTX maintained control to end the first half at 8-4. </p>

<p>GIANTX held fast to their advantage, winning the second pistol to take a 10-4 lead. They almost converted a second bonus, but were narrowly thwarted by <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4/crashies">
		crashies	</a>
</span> winning a 1v2 postplant. From there, FNATIC fought back to 10-7, but GIANTX continued to call confident set pieces and coordinated retakes to close out Sunset 13-10. </p>

<p><span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/9554/kaajak">
		kaajak	</a>
</span> was in good form on the map, scoring 26 kills and 213 ADR, but the members of GIANTX surpassed the rest of their opponents across the board to deny FNATIC the chance to defend their domestic trophy and now stand two wins away from turning their season around. </p>



<p>For Heretics, the game seemed simple on the surface. Win, and you&#39;re in, against a team that their current roster was 8-0 against in maps over the past two years. But much like GIANTX did against FNATIC, NAVI demonstrated superior individual form and plans to overcome the past, taking themselves one win closer to Champions and guaranteeing Team Liquid&#39;s qualification. </p>

<p>Now out of playoffs, Heretics&#39; fate is out of their hands; they must pray that Liquid wins at least one more match in order for them to qualify.</p>

<p>The fateful match began on NAVI&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530931/team-heretics-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr2/?game=231409&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Icebox</a>, a map Heretics lost <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530928/team-heretics-vs-bbl-esports-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-ubsf/?game=231400&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">13-6</a> to <span data-ref-id="10">

</span> earlier this week. A 3v5 pistol in favor of NAVI set the tone for the rest of the match, where NAVI would consistently come out on top in man disadvantage and clutch situations. NAVI snowballed from there, reading and dismantling Heretics&#39; defensive setups to cruise to a 9-3 lead at the half.</p>

<p>The second pistol was another 2v5 win for NAVI, promising a mercifully quick end to the one-sided affair as NAVI closed out the map 13-3. <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/18677/ruxic">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="12">

</span> continued to show outstanding form, the former ending with a 18 kills, a 1.76 rating, and 195 ADR and the latter putting up 20 kills, a 1.73 rating, and 187 ADR.</p>

<p>The next map was <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530931/team-heretics-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr2/?game=231410&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>, which had been a comfort pick for Heretics all year. This time, however, they looked off-kilter, and NAVI pounced on the opportunity with a 4-0 start led by <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/384/shao">

</span>, who found his first ace of the partnerships era in round 4 and went 14-2 in the first five rounds.</p>

<p><em>The first ace in VCT EMEA for one of the region&#39;s veterans.</em></p>

<p>The trend of man advantage fumbles continued, this time for both sides as a 2v4 from <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/1144/boo">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="15">

	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/109/ange1">
		ANGE1	</a>
</span> in round 6, putting the score at 6-1 in favor of NAVI. Heretics ultimately rallied to a 7-5 half, but it came at the hefty price of both of their timeouts. </p>

<p>Heretics won the second pistol to tie things up at 7-7, but those two rounds wins turned out to be their last. Without a timeout to stop NAVI&#39;s momentum, NAVI won out the rest of Haven in impressive fashion, capping off the statement 13-7 win with an ace from Ruxic in the final round. </p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXHfTBpbe9A?si=-UeZbiC_MyDYbTEb&amp;clip=UgkxkqNqK80fIXXVa_msOzVgKs_ijej-qodg&amp;clipt=ELWDmggY98qbCA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>Ruxic seals Heretics&#39; fate with an ace of his own.</em></p>

<p>Shao and Ruxic ended at the top of the scoreboard for both the map and the series as a whole with 37 kills apiece and respective ratings of 1.47 and 1.46 on the series. Ruxic now sits at the top of the standings for the entire league with a first-in-class 1.26 rating, 252 ACS, and an unbelievable 0.93 KPR playing only Omen and Viper.</p>

<p>VCT EMEA will return on Aug. 29 as Liquid and BBL will fight in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530932/bbl-esports-vs-team-liquid-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-ubf" target="_blank">upper bracket final</a> for the first grand final spot, while GIANTX and NAVI&#39;s Cinderella runs will collide head-on in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530933/giantx-vs-natus-vincere-vct-2025-emea-stage-2-lr3" target="_blank">lower bracket</a>.</p>
