Trump’s campaign, stars Brett Favre, the former N.F.L. quarterback who won a Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers. It began appearing in Pennsylvania over the past few days. Mr. Newlin said he expected to spend $2.5 million to $3 million on the ad as part of a $10 million television advertising buy in the state. The Favre ad will run frequently during weekend sports and news programs, he said.</em></p><p><em>Here’s a look at the ad, its accuracy and its major takeaway.</em></p><h2 id="link-2c6436f">On the Screen</h2><p>This ad is roughly what you would expect if your friend who does not work on Madison Avenue decided to moonlight in presidential advertising — with the exception that it features one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.</p><p>Mr. Favre, wearing a serious expression, a buzz cut and a sky-blue polo shirt, speaks directly to the camera in what could be his living room. Over his right shoulder are shelves holding family photos and pottery; over his left is a glimpse of trees and possibly a patio. The only graphic that appears identifies him as “Professional Football Hall of Fame QB.”</p><p>The most interesting part of the spot is at the end. Viewers are shown a huge blue image reading “Trump 2024” and informed that “Dan Newlin is responsible for the content of this advertisement.” Dan who? The viewer is given no information about Mr. Newlin, save for the toll-free number of his law firm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-23ca93f8">The Script</h2><p>Brett Favre</p><p>“I’m Brett Favre, and I’m endorsing Donald Trump in this election. Just look at the situation today. The bloodshed in the Middle East is relentless. Conflicts around the globe are escalating. And President Putin is threatening nuclear action.”</p><p>“Pennsylvania, we can’t take a chance. We need a strong leader, and I believe Donald Trump is the right choice to protect our families and restore world peace. So join me and vote Trump.”</p><h2 id="link-249eb87a">Accuracy</h2><p>There is indeed blood being spilled in the Middle East, and the conflict there is escalating. Mr. Putin has indeed spoken threateningly of nuclear war.</p><h2 id="link-6991c40e">The Takeaway</h2><p>Mr. Favre is not an inexperienced pitchman: He has been active in Republican politics for years, most memorably starring in an ad in the 2014 Republican Senate primary in Mississippi, his home state. Since retiring from football, he has frequently talked up his support for Mr. Trump.</p><p>The ad is aimed primarily at male voters, with an intimate feel: Mr. Favre is not throwing passes or basking in a crowd, but speaking directly to viewers. Despite his celebrity and wealth, the scene is domestic, much like familiar kitchen-table ads in which ordinary citizens discuss pocketbook issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Favre has no particular national security expertise. His notable experience with government was most recently his connection to an explosive scandal in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3499764/2022/05/10/brett-favre-among-those-sued-by-mississippi-department-of-human-services-for-squandering-welfare-funds/" title="">the State of Mississippi sued him and others</a>, accusing them of misspending public welfare funds.</p><p>He makes a plain-spoken, broad-strokes appeal for Mr. Trump’s noninterventionist philosophy. He never mentions Vice President Kamala Harris by name. He also never specifies how Mr. Trump might address the problems he identifies.</p><p>But it is not clear that of any that really matters — the ad is about Mr. Favre and his celebrity. Still, in selecting his pitchman, Mr. Newlin might have considered that, even now, more than 13 years later, the Packers remain hated by some Pennsylvanians for beating the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/theodore-schleifer">More about Theodore Schleifer</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
