In 2020, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/us/politics/wisconsin-georgia-trump-election.html" title="">narrowly rejected</a> the president’s efforts to overturn the state’s election results.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2023, when Wisconsin liberals took control of the court for the first time in 15 years, they were powered by a gusher of money and grass-roots anger over the abolition of abortion rights in the state after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade the previous summer.</p><p>But now Republicans are the ones with the most money, thanks to $6.2 million and counting from Elon Musk’s super PAC — and millions more from another group with ties to Mr. Musk. Democrats have found themselves playing defense to hold a seat they view as crucial to their political strength in the state.</p><p>Judge Schimel’s liberal opponent, Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge, and Wisconsin Democrats have zeroed in on Mr. Musk’s spending. The state’s Democratic Party is airing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jstxats3eCY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television ads tying Mr. Musk to Judge Schimel</a>, and it has branded a series of town-hall gatherings as “The People v.

A <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll conducted last month by Marquette University Law School</a> found that 97 percent of Democrats viewed Mr. Musk unfavorably.</p><p>“Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-cpac-chainsaw.html" title="">waving his chain saw around</a> and provoking debates over whether the Nazi salute and the Roman salute are the same thing has provoked an explosive level of fury,” said Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. “There is white-hot rage.”</p><p>Wisconsin Democrats have in recent years enjoyed an advantage in off-year and midterm elections. Their voters tend to be more attuned to political news than Republicans, and more likely to vote in contests other than presidential elections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At the same time, Mr. Musk’s super PAC is targeting Trump voters with a clear message: Help Mr. Trump by voting for Judge Schimel.</p><p>“President Trump needs your vote,” reads <a href="https://mailchi.mp/minttdata/mintts-freshest-badger-state-of-play?e=ef8ba43055" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">direct mail from the group</a> to Wisconsin Republicans. “Liberal Susan Crawford will stop President Trump’s agenda.”</p><p>Judge Schimel’s loyalty to Mr. Trump may wind up helping him even if it energizes Democrats. Brian Schimming, the chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-money.html" title="">if Judge Schimel could turn out 60 percent of Mr. Trump’s voters</a> from November, he would win.</p><p>“People who supported Donald Trump need to know this is not a guy who’s stiff-arming Trump,” said Mr. Walker, the state’s former governor, who added that he had personally appealed to the White House to have Mr. Trump hold a rally for Judge Schimel.
