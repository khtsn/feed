over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/world/americas/mexico-water-boquilla-dam.html" title="">a long-running water dispute</a> in a potential escalation of tensions with one of America’s biggest trading partners.</p><p>In a social media post, Mr. Trump accused Mexico of failing to provide 1.3 million acre-feet of water — or more than 420 billion gallons — under <a href="https://www.ibwc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1944Treaty.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 1944 treaty</a> mediating the distribution of water from three rivers, the Rio Grande, the Colorado and the Tijuana.</p><p>“Mexico has been stealing the water from Texas farmers,” Mr. Trump said, adding that “we will keep escalating consequences, including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!”</p><p>Responding to Mr. Trump’s post, Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, acknowledged that her country had fallen short of its treaty commitments, saying that a yearslong drought had significantly hindered its<span>  </span>ability to provide the full amount of water the agreement called for. She said that her government had sent “a comprehensive proposal” to U.S. diplomats to deliver water to Texas and find a solution satisfactory to both countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“To the extent of water availability, Mexico has been complying,” she wrote on social media. “I am sure that, as in other matters, an agreement will be reached.”</p><p>Mexico has struck a conciliatory tone in negotiations with the Trump administration, prioritizing dialogue over threats and a cool-headed approach over retaliatory measures. The strategy seems to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/americas/sheinbaum-trump-mexico-tariffs.html" title="">earned Ms. Sheinbaum some respect</a> from Mr. Trump, who earlier on Thursday called her “a terrific person” and “a fantastic woman.”</p><p>There have been longstanding tensions over water between Mexico and the United States. In 2020, those tensions exploded into violence, with Mexican farmers <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-c5feb6170aa6bd7c81cf3d41300fbee0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seizing control of a dam in the border region</a> in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the United States.</p><p>Rising temperatures and long droughts have made water more scarce, making the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable.</p><p>According to data provided by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which mediates water disputes between the two countries, Mexico has <a href="https://ibwcsftpstg.blob.core.windows.net/wad/WeeklyReports/Current_Cycle.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fallen well short</a> of its treaty commitments on water delivery in the last five years. Between October 2020 and October 2024, Mexico provided just over 400,000 acre-feet of water, far less than the roughly 1.4 million acre-feet called for under treaty stipulations. The debt has only grown since.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Cameron is a Times reporter covering Washington, focusing on breaking news and the Trump administration.</p></div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/claudia-sheinbaum-en">Claudia Sheinbaum</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Stock Market Comments: </strong>President Trump urged his social media audience to invest in the stock market just hours before pausing most of his reciprocal tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-stock-market.html">raising questions among government ethics experts</a> about market manipulation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robert F.
