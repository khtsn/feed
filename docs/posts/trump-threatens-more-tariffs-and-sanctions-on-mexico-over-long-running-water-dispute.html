She said that her government had sent “a comprehensive proposal” to U.S. diplomats to deliver water to Texas and find a solution satisfactory to both countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“To the extent of water availability, Mexico has been complying,” she wrote on social media. “I am sure that, as in other matters, an agreement will be reached.”</p><p>Mexico has struck a conciliatory tone in negotiations with the Trump administration, prioritizing dialogue over threats and a cool-headed approach over retaliatory measures. The strategy seems to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/americas/sheinbaum-trump-mexico-tariffs.html" title="">earned Ms. Sheinbaum some respect</a> from Mr. Trump, who earlier on Thursday called her “a terrific person” and “a fantastic woman.”</p><p>There have been longstanding tensions over water between Mexico and the United States. In 2020, those tensions exploded into violence, with Mexican farmers <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-c5feb6170aa6bd7c81cf3d41300fbee0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seizing control of a dam in the border region</a> in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the United States.</p><p>Rising temperatures and long droughts have made water more scarce, making the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable.</p><p>According to data provided by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which mediates water disputes between the two countries, Mexico has <a href="https://ibwcsftpstg.blob.core.windows.net/wad/WeeklyReports/Current_Cycle.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fallen well short</a> of its treaty commitments on water delivery in the last five years. Between October 2020 and October 2024, Mexico provided just over 400,000 acre-feet of water, far less than the roughly 1.4 million acre-feet called for under treaty stipulations. The debt has only grown since.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Cameron is a Times reporter covering Washington, focusing on breaking news and the Trump administration.</p></div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
