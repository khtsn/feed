One asked: “Does this program promote gender ideology?” Another sought to ascertain if the program was sending money overseas. A third questioned if the program could “impose an undue burden” on the exploitation of domestic energy sources.</p><p>While that review is continuing, the budget office directed federal agencies to pause any programs that could violate a series of executive orders related to those areas issued by Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Democrats called the move an abuse of executive power, saying it trampled on Congress’s authority over federal spending. On Tuesday afternoon, the freeze was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/28/us/trump-news-executive-orders/c3ae108f-1532-5cef-9e48-5cfba4bb7a9c?smid=url-share" title="">temporarily halted</a> by a federal judge in the District of Columbia in response to a lawsuit filed by a liberal advocacy group.</p><p>The announcement of the spending pause late Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/28/us/trump-news-executive-orders/trump-freeze-funding?smid=url-share" title="">threw the federal government into chaos</a> as agencies and nonprofits sought to determine whether they could continue carrying out basic functions. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, defended what she described as a review of federal spending and promised that direct aid to individuals, such as Social Security and Medicare, would not be affected.</p><p>Still, the budget office appears to be scrutinizing a wide variety of federal grant programs, including some that no longer seem to be active such as Covid-era assistance efforts, according to a 52-page list of instructions distributed to federal agencies that included 2,600 programs. A spokeswoman for the budget office did not answer questions about how the agency selected which programs would be included in the list.</p><p>The office’s requests for information range from Defense Department research on chemical and biological weapons defense to a Justice Department project on preventing the trafficking of young women. They also include a program meant to install broadband internet around the nation and another that provides free groceries to low-income women and children.</p><p>The Appalachian Regional Commission — which was created to spur economic growth in one of the United States’ poorest areas — was told to provide information about its grant programs. So was the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Fund, which was established by Congress in 1986 and named after the conservative former senator and presidential candidate from Arizona.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The office also instructed the Department of Homeland Security to answer questions about a grant that reimburses state and local law enforcement offices for guarding the president’s private residences.</p><p>Agencies were told to reply by Feb. 7.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Madeleine Ngo<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ana Swanson<!-- -->, <!-- -->John Ismay<!-- --> and <!-- -->Linda Qiu<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Times political reporter covering the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The First 100 Days of the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Military Changes:</strong> President Trump moved toward pushing openly transgender people out of the military and directed the Pentagon to end diversity programs as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-military-transgender-dei-orders.html">sought to reshape America’s armed forces</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Firing Prosecutors:</strong> The acting attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/justice-department-firings-trump-jack-smith.html">fired more than a dozen prosecutors</a> who worked on the investigations into Trump for the special counsel Jack Smith, saying they could not be trusted to “faithfully implement” the president’s agenda.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> When Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, refused military planes carrying deportees, infuriating Trump, he revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/americas/colombia-trump-deportation-flights-migrants.html">how heated the question of deportations has become</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health:</strong> Conservative Christian moms believe in home-schooling and distrust food and drug companies.
