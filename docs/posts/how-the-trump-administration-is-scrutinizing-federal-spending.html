    <h1>How the Trump Administration Is Scrutinizing Federal Spending</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Democrats called the move an abuse of executive power, saying it trampled on Congress’s authority over federal spending. On Tuesday afternoon, the freeze was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/28/us/trump-news-executive-orders/c3ae108f-1532-5cef-9e48-5cfba4bb7a9c?smid=url-share" title="">temporarily halted</a> by a federal judge in the District of Columbia in response to a lawsuit filed by a liberal advocacy group.</p><p>The announcement of the spending pause late Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/28/us/trump-news-executive-orders/trump-freeze-funding?smid=url-share" title="">threw the federal government into chaos</a> as agencies and nonprofits sought to determine whether they could continue carrying out basic functions. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, defended what she described as a review of federal spending and promised that direct aid to individuals, such as Social Security and Medicare, would not be affected.</p><p>Still, the budget office appears to be scrutinizing a wide variety of federal grant programs, including some that no longer seem to be active such as Covid-era assistance efforts, according to a 52-page list of instructions distributed to federal agencies that included 2,600 programs. A spokeswoman for the budget office did not answer questions about how the agency selected which programs would be included in the list.</p><p>The office’s requests for information range from Defense Department research on chemical and biological weapons defense to a Justice Department project on preventing the trafficking of young women. They also include a program meant to install broadband internet around the nation and another that provides free groceries to low-income women and children.</p><p>The Appalachian Regional Commission — which was created to spur economic growth in one of the United States’ poorest areas — was told to provide information about its grant programs. So was the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Fund, which was established by Congress in 1986 and named after the conservative former senator and presidential candidate from Arizona.</p></div></div>
