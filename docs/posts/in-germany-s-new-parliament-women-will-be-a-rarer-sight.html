The only apparent concession to modern sensibilities was that half of them are not wearing neckties.</p><p>Three-and-a-half years after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/world/europe/angela-merkel-farewell-germany.html" title="">only woman to serve as chancellor</a> retired, German national politics seems to be backsliding when it comes to diversity and gender parity. While in the United States the new administration has been actively scuttling D.E.I. programs, in Germany the change appears to be less deliberate. But it is no less striking.</p><p>The German Parliament has always been more male and less diverse than the population it represents, and the new one that will be sworn in on Tuesday will be more male and — compared with the society as a whole — less diverse than the one before it. Only 32 percent of the 630 new lawmakers are women, a drop from 35 percent when the last Parliament was formed in 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a country where society has appeared at times reluctant to turn away from traditional gender roles, the number of women in the highest elected body has been stagnating since 2013, when it hit a high of 36 percent. The president of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, pointed to this at a recent Women’s Day celebration.</p><p>“When our democracy has a problem with women, then our country has a problem with democracy,” Mr. Steinmeier said. In a speech, he noted that even if every elected woman from all of the country’s parties voted together as a bloc, they would not reach the one-third minority needed to block changes to the Constitution.</p><p>One reason for the erosion of women’s presence in the halls of power is Germany’s political drift to the right, where parties tend to have fewer female lawmakers.</p><p>In the Parliament, the Bundestag, women make up only 12 percent of the hard-right Alternative for Germany (known as the AfD); 23 percent of Mr. Merz’s conservative Christian Democratic Union; 25 percent of its Bavarian-only sister party, the Christian Social Union; and 42 percent among center-left Social Democrats.</p><p>Only among the smallest parties in Parliament — the Greens and Die Linke, both on the left — are female parliamentarians in the majority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/world/europe/germany-olaf-scholz-cabinet-women.html" title="">Olaf Scholz formed his cabinet</a> in 2021, he vowed that he would name as many women to be ministers as men. That balance stayed in place until Christine Lambrecht, the defense minister, was forced to resign after several missteps, and was replaced by a man.</p><p>Mr. Merz has cited Ms. Lambrecht’s mistakes to explain why, when he names a new, conservative-led government, he will not be striving for parity.</p><p>“With it, we wouldn’t be doing women any favors either,” he said in a <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/der_tag/Ein-Mann-von-gestern-Das-sagt-Friedrich-Merz-dazu-article25293641.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">television interview</a> late last year. The government is weeks away from being announced.</p><p>Mechthild Heil, who leads a group of women in Mr. Merz’s party, disagrees.</p><p>After taking note of the dearth of women’s voices in coalition talks, she went public with her concerns about the subordinate role women play in the party, writing a letter to Mr. Merz and demanding that women hold 50 percent of the leadership roles in Parliament.</p><p>“I can give you many examples of really competent women who are not being heard, who are not even sitting on the negotiating teams now,” Ms. Heil said. Without women present during negotiations, she said, important issues could be missed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Heil later explained why she had decided to go public.</p><p>“We are always being told to stay quiet, that they’ll fix these issues — but we have heard these arguments for years and years and nothing changes,” she said.</p><p>Andrea Römmele, a political scientist at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin and a keen watcher of German politics, says that one reason so few women are represented is that the pool of candidates is relatively small. Many women, she said, have to deal with dual pressures of work and raising a family.</p><p>“You can’t underestimate how work-intensive political work is,” she said.</p><p>Another problem, she says, is that many networks within political parties — especially when it comes to the Christian Democratic Union — formed years ago, when even fewer women were in position of power.</p><p>“It is striking when we now notice is how far behind we are all of a sudden,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christopher F.
