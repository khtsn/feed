The Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, said online on Thursday that he had been in Washington to meet with Trump administration officials.</p><p>Mr. Dmitriev’s visit is the first time in years that a senior Russian official was known to have traveled to the United States for talks with American counterparts. </p><p>Mr. Dmitriev is the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and President Vladimir V. Putin’s special representative for investment and economic cooperation. His counterpart, Mr. Witkoff, a real estate businessman who is also Mr. Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, traveled late last month to Moscow, where he met with Mr. Putin.</p><p>Mr. Dmitriev arrived in Washington with two aides on Tuesday, and he and Mr. Witkoff met in the White House on Wednesday afternoon, said the person in Washington familiar with the events. The two officials continued talking in the evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The talks appeared to be the latest step in Russia’s effort to improve ties with the United States. The rapprochement appeared to be hanging in the balance after Mr. Trump said last weekend that he was “very angry” at Mr. Putin for remarks that the Russian president had made on Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Dmitriev’s visit came despite sanctions imposed by the Biden administration that <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0612" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described him as “a known Putin ally.”</a> The meeting also took place as Mr. Trump excluded Russia from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/economy/trump-tariffs-chart.html" title="">roster of countries hit by the steep tariffs</a> unveiled on Wednesday.</p><p>The Treasury Department suspended sanctions on Mr. Dmitriev for seven days to allow him to visit, and the State Department then granted him a travel waiver and a visa, said the person in Washington. Mr. Dmitriev was still in Washington on Thursday. </p><p>Mr. Dmitriev said on Telegram on Thursday that he had met with “representatives of the administration of President Donald Trump” on Wednesday and would do so again on Thursday.</p><p>The White House National Security Council referred questions to the State Department on Thursday morning, and the State Department then referred questions to the White House.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Dmitriev, a 49-year-old former banker who studied at Stanford and Harvard and worked at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, has emerged as a key emissary for Mr. Putin in the Kremlin’s efforts to build a close relationship with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Dmitriev’s message, tailored to Mr. Trump’s pecuniary mind-set, has been that the United States stands to profit from closer ties with Russia.</p><p>In February, Mr. Dmitriev worked with Mr. Witkoff to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/russia-us-prisoner-exchange-marc-fogel.html" title="">help broker a prisoner exchange that led to the release of Marc Fogel</a>, an American teacher imprisoned in Moscow. </p><p>In talks with Mr. Witkoff and other American officials in Saudi Arabia days later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-putin-trump.html" title="">Mr. Dmitriev claimed that U.S. companies had incurred $324 billion in losses</a> by pulling out of Russia after Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Dmitriev <a href="https://t.me/kadmitriev/49" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in his social media post</a> on Thursday that his meetings were about restoring the U.S.-Russian dialogue. The relationship had been “completely destroyed under the Biden administration,” he wrote,<span>  </span>and the United States could benefit from cooperation “in international affairs and in the economy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“A real understanding of the Russian position opens up new opportunities for constructive interaction, including in the investment and economic sphere,” Mr. Dmitriev said.</p><p>He made no mention of the negotiations over the war in Ukraine between Moscow and Washington. Those talks appear to have run aground in recent days, after Mr. Putin<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-ukraine.html" title=""> rebuffed the proposal by Mr. Trump and Ukraine for a 30-day cease-fire</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump said last weekend that he was “very angry” over some of Mr. Putin’s comments about Ukraine, raising the possibility that the American president could drop his efforts to rebuild ties with Russia. </p><p>But Mr. Dmitriev’s visit indicated that the Trump administration was continuing to reverse the Biden administration’s isolation of Russia on the diplomatic stage.</p><p>In another sign of continuing engagement between Washington and Moscow, Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said this week that preparations were underway for a second round of talks aimed at easing the work of American and Russian diplomats operating in each other’s countries. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>U.S. and Russian officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-us.html" title="">first met in Istanbul on Feb. 27</a> for talks on unwinding years of tit-for-tat restrictions that reduced the American mission in Russia and the Russian mission in the United States to skeleton staffs.</p><p>“We can see signs of progress and our U.S. partners’ willingness to lift these obstacles to the normal work of diplomats in our respective capitals,” Mr. Lavrov said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anton Troianovski is the Moscow bureau chief for The Times.
