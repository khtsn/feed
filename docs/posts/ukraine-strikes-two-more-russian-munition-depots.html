It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/europe/ukraine-russia-strikes.html" title="">the second such attack</a> in less than a week as Kyiv seeks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/card/2024/09/19/world/europe/ukraine-attack-russia-munitions-depot" title="">escalate hits on Russian military bases</a> and warehouses to try to disrupt Moscow’s military logistics and slow its troops’ advance on the battlefield.</p><p>The strikes announced on Saturday targeted ammunition depots near the towns of Toropets, in northwestern Russia, and Tikhoretsk, in the country’s southwest. The facilities are both more than 200 miles from Ukrainian-controlled territory, and one has been identified as a major storage facility for munitions Russia has acquired from North Korea.</p><p>The General Staff of the Ukrainian Army <a href="https://t.me/GeneralStaffZSU/17385" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that its forces had struck both depots, but it stopped short of specifying the types of weapons used in the attack, saying only that the arsenals had been “hit by fire,” raising the possibility that it had used a new kind of weapon.</p><p>The attack came as Kyiv has been pressing its allies for weeks to let it use powerful, Western-delivered missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia. That authorization has yet to be granted, <a href="https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1015417.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky</a>, and in the meantime his country has sought to modify missiles and drones already in its arsenal for long-range use.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Moscow has not directly acknowledged the strikes on the depots, but regional authorities <a href="https://t.me/kondratyevvi/7787" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that a drone attack on Tikhoretsk</a> had “caused a fire that spread to explosive objects” and triggered detonations. Some 1,200 residents were <a href="https://t.me/kondratyevvi/7788" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evacuated from the area</a>. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that a drone attack near Toropets had forced the <a href="https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/21922011" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evacuation of a train station</a> and the <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/21922217" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspension of traffic on a highway</a>.</p><p>NASA satellites detected <a href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:2024-09-21;@31.65,56.36,13.00z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multiple</a> <a href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:2024-09-21;@40.08,45.88,13.00z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fires</a> at the two depots on Saturday. The attack came four days after another ammunition depot near Toropets was hit by Ukrainian drones, causing a huge explosion, with videos showing large fireballs lighting up the night sky.</p><p>Strikes on weapons arsenals are crucial for Ukraine to weaken Russia’s overwhelming fire superiority on the battlefield, military experts have said. Every week, Moscow bombards Ukrainian frontline positions and cities with missiles, guided bombs and artillery shells. Ukrainian soldiers have long been outgunned at the front, with Mr. Zelensky saying in April that Russia fires 10 shells for every Ukrainian one.</p><p>Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group, said, “The only way to defeat the Russian Army is to defeat its logistics,” most specifically by destroying its ammunition depots.</p><p>“This is the destruction of the most key component of warfare,” he added. “Tanks and guns without ammunition will not fire and will simply be ineffective.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The earlier attack on an ammunition depot this week took place on Wednesday, just outside Toropets, and appears to have caused serious damage. <a href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:2024-09-21;@31.71,56.50,14.00z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA satellites</a> continued to detect fires at that depot on Saturday, and <a href="https://x.com/DefenceHQ/status/1837410156629377094" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">satellite imagery released by the British Defense Ministry</a> showed destroyed storage bunkers and 280-foot-wide craters.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A satellite image showing ammunition bunkers on fire after an explosion at a weapons depot on Wednesday in Toropets, Russia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maxar Technologies, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The British ministry said that the depot “almost certainly housed munitions of varying calibers for frontline use, as well as missiles and glide bombs used by nearby airfields.”</p><p>Col. Ants Kiviselg, head of Estonia’s military intelligence center, <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609466482/edf-colonel-russia-s-naval-training-exercise-was-smaller-than-announced" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told journalists</a> on Friday that “30,000 tons of explosive ordnance were detonated” in the attack, the equivalent of about 750,000 shells.</p><p>“That’s two to three months’ supply of ammunition” for Russian forces in Ukraine, he noted. “As a result of this attack, Russia has suffered losses in ammunition and we will see the impact of these losses on the front in the coming weeks.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>His assessment could not be immediately confirmed.</p><p>It is unclear whether Saturday’s attacks had a similar impact. But one of the two depots that was targeted, the one near Tikhoretsk, has been used as a storage site for North Korean munitions shipped to Russia, as documented by several think tanks and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/us/politics/north-korea-weapons-russia-ukraine.html" title="">confirmed by the White House last fall</a>.</p><p>Since late 2022, Russia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/us/politics/north-korea-weapons-russia-ukraine.html" title="">turned to buying shells and missiles from North Korea</a>, which has a vast supply of Soviet-era weaponry, U.S. officials and independent analysts have said.</p><p>Many of those weapons arrived at the Tikhoretsk depot, whose storage capacity has recently been increased, according to reports by the Washington-based <a href="https://beyondparallel.csis.org/major-munitions-transfers-from-north-korea-to-russia/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a> and the London-based <a href="https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/report-orient-express-north-koreas-clandestine-supply-route-russia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Royal United Services Institute</a>.</p><p>Imagery from late September 2023 “shows trains arriving at the facility, delivering dozens of containers of the same size and colors as those being loaded in North Korea,” the institute’s report said. </p><p>The Ukrainian Army said that 2,000 tons of ammunition, including some from North Korea, had been delivered to the depot shortly before Saturday’s strike. The claim could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ukrainian officials have said that the injection of North Korean weapons into the battlefield, particularly artillery shells, has helped Russian forces maintain an edge.</p><p>“Of all Russia’s allies, our biggest problem is North Korea,” Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said at a security conference last week in Kyiv. “Because with the volume of military products that they supply, they actually affect the intensity of the fighting.”</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1837359410479268180" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Analysts say</a> that the Tikhoretsk depot has also been an important nexus in supplying Russian forces. It is roughly equidistant from the combat zone in southeastern Ukraine and from Crimea, the Russian-occupied peninsula that has been an important logistics hub for funneling ammunition to the rest of the southern front.</p><p>It also remains unclear what type of weapons Ukraine used to attack the depots.</p><p>Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow for air power and technology at the Royal United Services Institute, said it was “entirely possible to set off ammunition stored in the open even with relatively small warheads” carried by attack drones “if they hit the right place.”</p><p>But Mr. Kuzan said that the ammunition depots were often protected with earth berms and underground concrete shelters that made them difficult to attack with drones.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“To do this you need not just a missile, it must be a heavy missile,” he said, pointing to long-range weapons supplied to Ukraine by Western allies, such as the British-French Storm Shadow missiles.</p><p>But Ukraine has so far been barred by its allies from using those weapons inside Russia. Mr. Zelensky told journalists on Friday that the White House was afraid that such an authorization would escalate the war. He said he would use a trip to the United States next week to try to persuade President Biden to lift the ban.</p><p>To circumvent it for now, at least partially, Ukraine has begun developing its own weapons, such as anti-ship missiles modified for land attacks, which it says it has already used to target Russia’s oil infrastructure. Kyiv also says it has developed long-range rocket drones that carry large warheads and can strike targets hundreds of miles away.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
