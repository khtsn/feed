Large-scale paintings of the Danish flag and slaughtered pigs hung on the walls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The pigs, which were given water but no food, were expected to live up to five days. Evaristti said he also would not eat or drink until the exhibition came to an end.</p><p>But the pigs did not die. They disappeared.</p><p>Evaristti, who was born in Chile, said that while the exhibition space was being cleaned on Saturday morning, members of an animal rights organization came to check on the piglets. Shortly after they left, the theft occurred.</p><p>“They closed the door while the cleaning people were cleaning the toilet,” he said, adding that the door was unlocked. “After four minutes, they come out and it was no pigs.”</p><p>A spokesman for the Copenhagen Police said that it was notified about the theft just before noon on Saturday and that nobody had been charged. Evaristti, who said he and his family had received numerous threats, does not expect the piglets to be returned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Evaristti said his exhibition was meant to “wake up the Danish society” to the mistreatment of pigs in the country, which is one of the world’s largest pork exporters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emil Nicolai Helms/Ritzau Scanpix, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The use of animals in artwork is frequently criticized. In 2017, the Guggenheim in New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/arts/design/guggenheim-dog-fighting-exhibit.html" title="">pulled three works involving animals</a> from an exhibition by Chinese conceptual artists after protests and an online petition signed by more than half a million people. In 2000, Evaristti <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/arts/animals-have-taken-over-art-art-wonders-why-metaphors-run-wild-but-sometimes-cow.html" title="">displayed 10 goldfish in individual blenders</a> in a Danish museum and allowed visitors to turn on the machines. Some did.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Animal rights groups were divided over Evaristti’s latest exhibition, with some agreeing with his message but not his method and presentation. A review from a Danish newspaper slammed the exhibition as <a href="https://politiken.dk/kultur/kunst/art10311567/Er-Marco-Evaristti-kunstens-svar-p%C3%A5-en-airfryer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“old-fashioned avant-garde.”</a></p><p>Mathias Madsen, a campaign manager for Anima International Denmark, said in a statement that the organization had reported Evaristti to the police when he announced his plans to starve the piglets to death.</p><p>“This would violate multiple sections of the Danish Animal Welfare Act, and we wanted authorities prepared to intervene,” Madsen said, adding that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGvqMBSMg4p/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the strong public reaction to the exhibition</a> was a reminder that people find animal suffering unacceptable.</p><p>There are about 5,000 pig farms in Denmark that produce approximately 28 million pigs annually, <a href="https://agricultureandfood.dk/danish-agriculture/agriculture/livestock/pigs/#:~:text=Around%205%2C000%20pig%20farms%20in,abattoirs%20Danish%20Crown%20and%20Tican." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Danish Agriculture and Food Council</a>. Many are slaughtered, with more than 70 percent of the pig meat exported to countries within the European Union.</p><p>Birgitte Damm, the chief consultant for farm animals and mink for Animal Protection Denmark, said about 25,000 piglets die each day in Danish stables, some from starvation, because the country’s sows are bred to birth 20 piglets but have only 14 teats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We completely understand the indignation, frustration and even anger over the continued abuse of millions of pigs in the Danish pig industry,” Damm said about Evaristti’s exhibition. “This has been going on for decades, and it is completely unacceptable. However, we cannot allow three individual piglets to suffer in order to make our point.”</p><p>Evaristti said his idea for the exhibition came from reading a newspaper article about the topic around October. “I knew that something was wrong in Denmark, but I didn’t know that it was so bad,” he said.</p><p>On Monday night, he faced a critical question: What now? He said that an exhibition without the piglets would be “boring” and “plastic,” before he shut it down altogether on Tuesday.</p><p>“If you take your heart from your body, you cannot exist, only as the body without soul,” he said. “My exhibition doesn’t have a soul anymore. It’s only a body and I’m not interested in representing a body. I want the soul with the body.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
