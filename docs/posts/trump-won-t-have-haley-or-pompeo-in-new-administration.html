    <h1>Trump Won’t Have Haley or Pompeo in New Administration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Saturday that he would not invite Nikki Haley, his former ambassador to the United Nations, or Mike Pompeo, his former secretary of state, to join his incoming administration.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s announcement on Truth Social, his social media platform, was an early indication of the decision-making process of the president-elect as he navigates the ideologic differences within the Republican Party.</p><p>Days after his election win over Vice President Kamala Harris, Mr. Trump’s team has already started his first formal transition meetings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/trump-personnel-cabinet-candidates.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">ramped up the process for building his new cabinet.</a></p><p>By ruling out Mr. Pompeo and Ms. Haley, Mr. Trump was rejecting two Republicans who had backed U.S. support for Ukraine at a time when Mr. Trump and many of his allies have pushed to curtail American aid for allies and military involvement overseas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,” Mr. Trump said in the post. “I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country.”</p><p>Mr. Trump was also turning away two top officials in his first administration who in recent years had shared criticism of him.</p><p>Many in Mr. Trump’s orbit, including David Sacks, a major Trump donor, viewed Mr. Pompeo as being too eager to use the military overseas. Mr. Trump also likely did not forget that, in 2023, Mr. Pompeo <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/03/pompeo-trump-cpac/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned during the Conservative Political Action Conference</a> that Republicans should not follow “celebrity leaders with their own brand of identity politics — those with fragile egos who refuse to acknowledge reality.”</p><p>Days later, during an interview with Fox News, Mr. Pompeo claimed he was not talking about Mr. Trump, while also <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/05/mike-pompeo-trump-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticizing his former boss’s fiscal policy.</a></p><p>Mr. Pompeo in 2022 also criticized Mr. Trump’s handling of classified documents after the F.B.I. raided his home in Mar-a-Lago.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“No one gets to keep classified information outside of a place classified information should be. That is certainly true,” Mr. Pompeo said, while also denouncing the Justice Department for its handling of the case.</p><p>Ms. Haley was also Mr. Trump’s last rival to drop out of the race for the Republican nomination. Just days before the election, Ms. Haley said the Trump campaign’s rhetoric was driving away women and minorities, citing the racist and misogynistic remarks by speakers at a Trump rally held at Madison Square Garden in October.</p><p>“This bromance and this masculinity stuff, it borders on edgy to the point that it’s going to make women uncomfortable,” Ms. Haley said. Despite repeated offers to provide advice to the campaign, Mr. Trump mostly kept her at a distance during his presidential run. Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html" title="">gamble to mobilize men</a>, despite them historically voting less than women, would end up paying off.</p><p>Both Mr. Pompeo and Ms. Haley did eventually vocally support Mr. Trump and endorse his nomination.</p></div></div></div>
