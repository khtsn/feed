Manbij has been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-kurds.html" title="">focal point of violence</a> between armed groups, one backed by the United States and the other by Turkey. The blast on Monday was one of the deadliest such attacks since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/syria-civil-war-rebels.html" title="">the fall of Bashar al-Assad in December</a>.</p><p>The Turkish-backed fighters wrested control of the city in December from Kurdish-led forces, who are supported by the United States, and there has since been a spate of car bombings, according to the White Helmets, the Syrian civil defense force.</p><p>The agricultural workers were being transported in the back of a truck when a car bomb exploded alongside them on the outskirts of the city, which lies about 55 miles northeast of Aleppo, the White Helmets said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Most of the dead were women.

To that end, the new authorities have announced the dissolution of all armed factions in the rebel coalition that toppled Mr. Assad, the country’s longtime dictator.</p><p>It remains unclear, however, whether armed groups that have so far refused to give up their weapons — including the Kurdish-led forces who control most of northeastern Syria — will eventually accept that mandate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Unifying Syria’s complex web of armed groups under a single umbrella, experts say, is among the most pressing challenges facing the new government.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
