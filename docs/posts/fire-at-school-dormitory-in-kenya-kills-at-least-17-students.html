An additional 15 children were being treated for injuries. </p><p>“This is devastating news,” President William Ruto <a href="https://x.com/WilliamsRuto/status/1831936091093348487" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>. “Those responsible will be held to account.”</p><p>Kenya has a legacy of boarding schools, dating to the country’s colonial period. Public and private schools are popular with parents, sometimes as a form of prestige or, in rural areas, to spare children from commuting long distances to receive an education.</p><p>But there have been long-running concerns about the safety record of the schools. The government appointed a task force in late 2016, in response to a series of arson attacks related to student unrest. </p><p>But in 2017, just weeks after the investigation into safety standards had concluded, 10 students died in a fire at a prestigious girls’ school in Nairobi.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The report laid out a set of requirements intended to prevent overcrowding and requiring better building standards. </p><p>Rigathi Gachagu, Mr. Ruto’s deputy, urged schools on Friday to enforce the safety and security measures imposed by the education ministry and other agencies in order to “avert such incidences.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lynsey Chutel covers South Africa and the countries that make up southern Africa from Johannesburg.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lynsey-chutel">More about Lynsey Chutel</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
