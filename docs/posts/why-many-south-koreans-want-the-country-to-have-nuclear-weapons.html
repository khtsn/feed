President Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/us/politics/biden-south-korea-state-visit.html" title="">emphatically reiterated</a> that commitment last year, vowing that any nuclear attack by North Korea would lead to the destruction of its government.</p><p>But decades of American assurances have failed to deter North Korea from building a nuclear arsenal and then expanding it. Led by Kim Jong-un, North Korea has also become more provocative, testing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/17/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-icbm.html" title="">missiles</a> powerful enough to reach the United States. And it has rattled South Korea by reviving a Cold War-era defense agreement with Russia, another nuclear-armed state.</p><p>The South has long considered it a taboo to pursue atomic weapons in defiance of Washington’s nonproliferation policy. But jitters about security here have been intensified by the possible re-election of former President Donald J. Trump, whose commitment to the alliance between Washington and Seoul appears to be shaky at best.</p><p>Now, a growing majority of South Koreans say their country needs its own nuclear weapons instead of relying on the United States for protection. The idea, although still disavowed by the South Korean government, is increasingly becoming part of mainstream political debate.</p></div></div><div><p>Polls show that many South Koreans say they can no longer trust the American nuclear umbrella to guard them from North Korea. They doubt that Washington would come to their aid in the event of a conflict with North Korea now that Pyongyang is racing to develop the ability to attack American cities with nuclear warheads.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A news broadcast in May in Seoul with file footage of a North Korean missile launch.

Tens of thousands of American troops have been garrisoned for decades in the South, which for many years also hosted U.S. nuclear weapons. Washington withdrew those arms in 1991, hoping the disarmament would incentivize Pyongyang to stop pursuing its own nuclear weapons.</p><p>For a while, Washington had two important partners in that effort: China and Russia. But in recent years, it has found itself increasingly at odds with both of those countries on issues such as trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine. Now, neither <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/26/asia/us-north-korea-united-nations-intl-hnk/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cooperates</a> in American-led efforts to roll back North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Kim’s regime has tested both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-test.html" title="">atomic weapons</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/17/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-icbm.html" title="">intercontinental ballistic missiles</a>. It is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test.html" title="">developing</a> technology to deliver multiple nuclear warheads with a single missile. It is also escalating its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/09/world/asia/north-korea-kim-weapons-law.html" title="">threat</a> to target South Korea with a fleet of nuclear-capable, short-range ballistic missiles, which Mr. Kim said this month he would deploy near the border with South Korea.</p><p>In June, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated that North Korea had built roughly 50 nuclear warheads and had enough fissile material to build another 40 or so. It was also focusing on tactical nuclear weapons, which have a smaller payload.</p><p>“There is a growing concern that North Korea might intend to use these weapons very early in a conflict,” wrote Matt Korda, a researcher at the institute.</p><p>It was fears such as these that President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea tried to address when he met Mr. Biden at the White House last year. The two leaders deepened their alliance and signed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/29/world/asia/yoon-biden-south-korea.html" title="">Washington Declaration</a> to show that the American defense commitment was ironclad. Last month, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/11/joint-statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-of-the-united-states-of-america-and-president-yoon-suk-yeol-of-the-republic-of-korea-on-u-s-rok-guidelines-for-nuclear-deterrence-and-nuclear-operations-o/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they reaffirmed</a> that any nuclear attack by North Korea would be met with “a swift, overwhelming and decisive response.”</p><p>“For the first time, it has been written down in a document that American nuclear assets will be tasked with deterring and countering North Korea’s nuclear force,” said Kim Tae-hyo, Mr. Yoon’s deputy national security adviser.</p></div></div><div><p>But that has done little to tamp down misgivings in South Korea about the American nuclear umbrella, which also covers Japan.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea and President Biden, who met at the White House last year, agreed in April to new provisions meant to deter North Korean nuclear attacks.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt was anchored in Busan, South Korea, in June.

And while Mr. Yoon has been more antagonistic toward the North than his recent predecessors and briefly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-weapons.html" title="">warmed to the idea</a> of going nuclear, there is little political will in the South to pursue atomic weapons.</p><p>Strengthening reconnaissance and missile abilities, analysts say, would serve South Korea better and give it the ability to launch pre-emptive strikes against the North.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers standing guard last year at the DMZ, the border between North Korea and South Korea.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W.

He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy.html" title="">once said</a> he would be open to allowing Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear arsenals rather than depend on the American nuclear umbrella.</p><p>“It could open a window of opportunity,” said Mr. Cheong, the pro-nuclear analyst.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Honoring African Soldiers: </strong>Two months after D-Day, an Allied force dominated by soldiers conscripted from French colonies swept into southern France. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/france-african-soldiers-world-war-ii.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">It’s a chapter of its history that France has long obscured</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Afghanistan’s Anniversary of the Taliban Takeover: </strong>Celebrations marking the third year since the U.S. withdrawal and the Taliban’s return to power are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-anniversary.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">amplifying a divide in Afghanistan</a> over what principles it should be governed by.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brazil’s Maid Rooms: </strong>The tiny rooms, a vestige of the country’s history of slavery, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/americas/brazil-maid-rooms-racist-past.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">disappearing or being transformed</a> as Brazil confronts deeply ingrained inequities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Living in China’s Military Shadow: </strong>More than 200 Filipino civilian settlers on a contested island in the South China Sea find themselves on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/asia/spratlys-thitu-philippines-china.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">the frontier of a possible conflict with China</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>What to Do With a Nazi Villa: </strong>Owned by the State of Berlin, the former estate of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/world/europe/joseph-goebbels-germany-nazi-house.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-international-general&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">too expensive to keep and perilous to sell</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
