But the talks and the frenetic swirl of diplomatic activity leading up to them did nothing to bring the two sides closer to negotiating an end to the war and easing the daily carnage, with soldiers on both sides being killed and injured on the front every day, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">the civilian toll</a> steadily rising.</p><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, called the attack on Saturday “a deliberate and barbaric war crime.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Instead of putting an end to the killing already now, as the US, Europe, Ukraine, and others propose, Putin continues to wage a war against civilians,” he said in a statement, referring to Russia’s leader, Vladimir V.
