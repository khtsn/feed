(The government recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/world/europe/italy-citizenship-rules.html" title="">narrowed that eligibility</a>.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On the other hand, Italy has made it hard for immigrants to obtain citizenship. Immigrants from countries outside the European Union with sufficient income and no criminal record can apply for citizenship only after 10 years of uninterrupted residency in Italy. That is longer than other European countries such as France or Germany, where under some conditions immigrants can apply for citizenship after five years.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Migrants waiting to request residence permits in Turin, Italy, in January.

That would include nearly 300,000 minors, who would obtain citizenship if their parents do.</p><p>Among those affected is Meriem Khaldoun, a Moroccan architect in the northern Italian city of Genoa. Ms. Khaldoun has lived in Italy her whole adult life. But because she formally registered her residency only five years ago, she must wait five more years to apply for Italian citizenship. In the meantime, she is working with the city’s authorities on an urban regeneration project.</p><p>Progressive parties have largely supported the referendum, but the right has opposed it.</p><p>The referendum is “dangerous” and would extend access to citizenship “indiscriminately,” Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s far-right League Party and Italy’s deputy prime minister, said last month.</p><h2 id="link-520aa75b">Will it pass?</h2><p>It won’t be clear whether enough voters cast ballots until polls close Monday afternoon.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, voters flocked to the polls for referendums to uphold the legalization of divorce and abortion. But in Italy’s last referendum, held in 2022, which focused on judicial questions, only 20 percent of eligible voters turned out.</p><p>“The citizens have stopped voting,” said Michele Ainis, a constitutional expert at Roma Tre university, making it much harder for referendums to pass.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>This referendum also includes four additional questions on Italian labor law.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Posters in Milan on Wednesday calling for a yes vote on the referendum.
