    <h1>Big Tech’s Troubles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><div id="top-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-top">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p><div></div></div><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Yesterday, the Justice Department asked a federal judge to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/technology/google-search-remedies-hearing.html" title="">break up Google</a>. The judge had already declared that the company has a monopoly in online search, and the government argues that the solution is to take apart one of the biggest corporations in the world.</p><p>The government’s position reflects its increasingly aggressive approach toward Big Tech. In a separate case on Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Google had acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online advertising. And a federal trial against Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, began last week. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg took the stand to defend the company, and more executives are expected to testify in the coming months.</p><p>Not so long ago, Washington was smitten with Silicon Valley. But then tech companies consolidated power, and lawmakers grew skeptical. Over time, members of both parties decided they had to dismantle what they felt were monopolies.</p><p>Now Big Tech faces two important issues in these cases: a broader policy debate over monopolies, and President Trump’s personal feelings toward the companies. Today’s newsletter explains both.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-8ad10ca">Bigger business</h2><p>First, the policy debate. The federal lawsuits argue that tech companies use their size to stifle competition. (My colleague David McCabe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/technology/trump-tech-antitrust-cases.html" title="">broke down the major cases here</a>.)</p><p>Exhibit A: Google’s handling of online search. The company has made itself the default search option on its products, such as the Chrome web browser and the Android operating system. It also pays Apple and others to use its search engine as the default on their phones.</p><p>Similarly, Meta has bought competitors, like Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp, to consolidate its power. Meta says that it still faces plenty of competition, including from newer apps like TikTok.</p><p>My colleague Mike Isaac pointed to a telling line from Zuckerberg’s testimony last week in which he quoted a former Intel executive: “Only the paranoid survive.” That remark acts as a sort of Rorschach test for both sides.</p><p>“For the government, it means Zuckerberg and his lieutenants were constantly monitoring the competitive landscape and were willing to quickly snuff out even the faintest threat to his business,” Mike said. “For Zuckerberg, it means that his position as king of the social media hill is always tenuous. One day you’re on top, like Myspace. The next you’re in the gutter — like Myspace.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>All of this reflects a broader trend, one that isn’t unique to the tech industry. Over the past several decades, big business has become bigger. The largest companies have gobbled up more of their industries, as this chart by my colleague Ashley Wu shows:</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-18-ambriefing-corporate-concentration-index" data-id="100000010119145" data-source-id="100000010119145"><div slug="2025-04-18-ambriefing-corporate-concentration-index" data-sourceid="100000010119145" id="embed-id-100000010119145">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For everyday Americans, less competition can mean lower wages, higher prices and worse products. The classic example is internet service. Across much of the country, people have only one or two options for internet. Providers get away with higher prices, spotty coverage and bad customer service because they know their users don’t have better alternatives.</p><p>Corporate consolidation across all industries costs the typical American household more than $5,000 a year, one economist estimated.</p><h2 id="link-6a6d212">Trump’s choice</h2><p>The most important factor in these cases, though, might be Trump. Yes, his administration and his supporters have advanced the antitrust cause. But Trump sometimes puts his personal opinions over policy interests. He could do the same here — and get his administration to drop the cases against Google, Meta and others.</p><p>Knowing this, tech giants have tried to gain Trump’s favor. The companies’ leaders appeared at Trump’s inauguration, smiling and clapping as the president delivered his speech. Zuckerberg stopped fact-checking at Facebook and Instagram, agreeing with Trump and other critics that it was biased against conservatives and calling it “something out of ’1984.’” Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, met recently with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to hear about Republicans’ concerns, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/17/google-republican-censorship-ted-cruz-jim-jordan-00294558" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Politico reported</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>So far, the overtures haven’t persuaded Trump to drop the lawsuits or settle them. But the cases still have weeks or months left — maybe more with appeals. The tech giants hope they can change Trump’s mind by then.</p><h3 id="link-5e9232f0"><span><strong>POPE FRANCIS</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners in St. Peter’s Square, Vatican City. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gianni Cipriano for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He was, as our Rome bureau chief Jason Horowitz put it, “a pope of surprises.”</p><p>Jason — who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-new-york-times.html" title="">covered Pope Francis from the day of his election</a> a dozen years ago through his death from a stroke at age 88 yesterday morning — was on vacation in Tuscany when the news broke. He started writing from the car back to Rome and filed several dispatches throughout the day.</p><p>Francis “kept the church he led, the world he cared so much about and the reporters who followed him on their toes,” Jason wrote. “I covered him in unexpected destinations — Mongolia, Iraq, Myanmar — where he drew attention to humanitarian plights that were off the global radar.”</p><p>Among those trips was one to Bangladesh in 2017, where the pope was “visibly moved, his voice tight,” as he met with members of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority group. “That hammered home how much Francis cared about the plight of migrants, the displaced victims of war and the most forgotten and marginalized among us, no matter their religion,” Jason wrote. “For him, their suffering was real.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On the papal plane, Jason says, Francis was “an easygoing guy with a good sense of humor, better at glad-handing the news media” than most politicians. “He willingly compared notes with me on getting stuck in elevators after a week in which we had both gotten stuck in elevators,” Jason added. “I saw him accept enough sweets to feed an army.”</p><p>Jason was one of five Times journalists working on the ground in Rome yesterday, according to our Europe editor, Adrienne Carter. She said that number would likely double in coming days for Francis’ funeral and the conclave to choose his successor.</p><p>When the Vatican announced the pope’s death, it was Adrienne who set into motion a plan crafted years before and updated when Francis landed in the hospital with pneumonia in February.</p><p>“Day 1 is in many ways the straightforward part — it’s what comes next that requires the deeper thinking and the richer reporting,” she said. “How do you get behind the scenes of this secretive moment, the conclave? How do you get the inner workings of this sometimes impenetrable institution? How do you understand the politics of the moment, the different influences factions may have?”</p><p>It’s a story our global newsroom will be covering intensely over the coming days and weeks.
