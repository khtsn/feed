    <h1>The Rise of Women’s Basketball</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Attend, or even just watch, a women’s sports game these days and you’ll see the phrase splashed across the front of fans’ black T-shirts: “Everyone watches women’s sports.”</p><p>At last year’s N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament, that idea seemed truer than ever. For the first time since the inception of the N.C.A.A. women’s championship in 1982, the women’s final drew more viewers than the men’s — 18.9 million compared with 14.8.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For the women, it was a dramatic jump from the year before, when the final drew almost 10 million viewers. For the men, it continued a downward trend: Viewership was roughly half what it was in 2015, according to Nielsen.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The 2023 and 2024 finals featured Caitlin Clark, whose four years with the Iowa Hawkeyes helped push the sport to new highs. But Clark did not do it alone: Women’s basketball had been growing before her arrival.</p><h2 id="link-588cda42">A parade of superstars</h2><p>Men’s basketball had a head start.</p><p>The N.C.A.A. was created in 1906, but it did not have leagues for all women’s sports until after the 1972 passage of Title IX, a law that requires equal treatment for all students in school sports. Over those first seven decades, the men received more investment and also more airtime, which gave them greater visibility.</p><p>Over the last 30 years, though, women have narrowed the attention gap, with help from a cadre of superstars who paved the way for Clark.</p><p>Rebecca Lobo led the University of Connecticut to its first national championship in 1995; now the Huskies have a record 11 titles. Tennessee’s Candace Parker in 2006 became the first woman to dunk during the N.C.A.A. tournament. And Sabrina Ionescu finished her career at Oregon in 2020 with more than 2,000 career points, 1,000 rebounds and 1,000 assists — the first men’s or women’s collegiate player to do so.</p><h2 id="link-3e84044c">A new era</h2><p>More recently, the rivalry between Clark of Iowa and Angel Reese of Louisiana State pushed the sport forward once again. Their games attracted sellout crowds, even on the road, and broke TV viewership records.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the same time, the popularity of the W.N.B.A., women’s soccer, and even of sports like women’s rugby exploded. Women’s sports bars began opening across the country. Ad dollars <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/11/ad-spending-womens-sports-doubles.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rose sharply</a>. And the introduction of name, image and likeness programs made it so that college athletes could cash in on their celebrity.</p><p>With Clark and Reese now graduated to the W.N.B.A, women’s college basketball seems to be holding its own.</p><p>On ESPN, viewership is up 3 percent from last season, according to The <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/03/12/life-after-caitlin-womens-hoops-viewership-staying-historically-strong/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sports Business Journal</a>. More than a million people tuned in to see U.C.L.A. defeat U.S.C. in the Big 10 Conference championship last Sunday — an impressive number, though it’s two million fewer viewers than those who tuned in to the same game last year, when Clark played.</p><p>Tonight, the N.C.A.A. will announce which teams are in the women’s and men’s tournaments. The women’s field has big stars — including Paige Bueckers of UConn and JuJu Watkins of U.S.C. — and talented teams like Texas, Notre Dame and U.C.L.A. that will try to stop South Carolina from winning its second straight title.</p><h2 id="link-79caf965">More from The Athletic</h2><ul><li><p>Sabreena Merchant breaks down the women’s field: She thinks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6189807/2025/03/10/womens-college-basketball-power-rankings-ncaa-tournament/" title="">five teams have a shot at the title</a>.</p></li><li><p>Sabreena and Ben Pickman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6178737/2025/03/06/womens-college-basketball-debate-ncaa-tournament-champion-contenders/" title="">chose a few dark-horse candidates</a>, including West Virginia and Florida State.</p></li><li><p>Jordan Brenner and Peter Keating identified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6180736/2025/03/06/march-madness-2025-ncaa-tournament-potential-cinderella-teams/" title="">a few Cinderella candidates</a> on the men’s side, including Drake and Utah State.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-2f84a1ff">Immigration</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><ul><li><p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from using <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/trump-alien-enemies-act-deportations-venezuelans.html?smid=url-share" title="">an obscure wartime law from 1798</a> to deport Venezuelans without a hearing.

The pain — it felt “like being hit by a knife attached to a freight train,” she writes in her memoir — turned out to be an apt metaphor for her career at Facebook, where she worked for seven years starting in 2011. In “Careless People,” Wynn-Williams recalls her time there, first as manager of global public policy and eventually as director. This is an insider’s account — she flew on private planes with Mark Zuckerberg and navigated Davos alongside Sheryl Sandberg, then chief executive officer — and she has stories. Some are choice tidbits (Sandberg’s $13,000 lingerie bill); others are classic corporate drama (should Zuckerberg follow Big Bird in a lineup of speakers at the Global Citizen Festival?). But the real takeaway from this frank, occasionally funny book is Wynn-Williams’s disillusionment. She signed on with dreams of global connection and left convinced that, as she puts it, “Facebook is an autocracy of one.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>Our critic described “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/books/review/careless-people-sarah-wynn-williams.html" title="">Careless People</a>” as “darkly funny and genuinely shocking: an ugly, detailed portrait of one of the most powerful companies in the world.”</p></li><li><p>Looking for a novel to read this spring?
