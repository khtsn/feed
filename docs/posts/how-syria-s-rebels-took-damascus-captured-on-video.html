Children playing in the halls of a building once controlled by the former regime.</p><p>The fall of Damascus, Syria’s capital, happened quickly and dramatically, and much of what we know about the end of Bashar al-Assad’s reign in the country was captured on people’s phones for the world to see. Footage began emerging on social media at 4 a.m. local time on Sunday. It showed the rapid advance of a rebel army that took control of Damascus in just a few hours.</p><p>Despite reports that government forces were preparing to defend the capital, the Syrian army was nowhere to be found. One video from Damascus showed a military checkpoint that had been abandoned. Inside, what looked like army uniforms littered the floor of the building, which was plastered with large posters of Mr. al-Assad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/08/09vid-damascus-scenes-39146-cover/09vid-damascus-scenes-39146-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>On the northern outskirts of the city, rebel forces moved swiftly to take control of Sednaya prison, a notorious government complex known for torturing and executing political prisoners.
