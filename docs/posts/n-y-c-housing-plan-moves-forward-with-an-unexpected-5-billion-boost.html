City officials estimate the changes could make way for 80,000 additional homes.</p><p>The plan was passed by the Council’s Land Use Committee in a 8-to-2 vote with one abstention. The vote was delayed for hours as opponents — including some council members who represent neighborhoods with more single-family homes — successfully fought to slightly water down some of the original proposal.</p><p>The plan that the committee approved still left most of the initiative’s key elements intact, but softened requirements over parking mandates and tightened the ways homeowners will be allowed to add apartments on their properties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plan, which now goes to the full Council for a vote on Dec. 5, where it is expected to pass, was a top priority for Mayor Eric Adams and has been seen as a key test of his influence after his indictment in September on federal corruption charges.</p><p>It was also an opportunity for the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, to assert her own influence by adding some of <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/press/2024/11/01/2732/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her housing priorities</a>, including additional funding for affordable housing and homeownership programs.</p><p>The $5 billion — $4 billion in city money and $1 billion from the state — is not tied to any specific City of Yes proposal, but is a sign of the city’s commitment to helping people find housing, according to two people familiar with the agreement.</p><p>The politics are complicated: Many progressive City Council members support the plan despite their frosty relationship with Mr. Adams; many of the mayor’s more conservative allies in the City Council oppose the plan.</p><p>The mayor, who has record low approval ratings, has been largely absent from the push to get it approved. Instead, Mr. Adams has relied on two allies: Dan Garodnick, the director of the Department of City Planning, and Maria Torres-Springer, his first deputy mayor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We have advanced something here which meaningfully moves the needle on housing production in New York City,” <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2024/11/18/department-of-city-planning-director-talks-about-congestion-pricing---city-of-yes-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Garodnick said on NY1 this week</a>.</p><p>Lincoln Restler, a progressive council member from Brooklyn, praised Ms. Adams and Mr. Garodnick, a former council member, for working hard to advance the plan. He criticized Mr. Adams and his office for failing to line up support for his own initiative.</p><p>“It’s not just that the mayor has zero political capital — he’s toxic,” Mr. Restler said.</p><p>New York City is facing its worst housing shortage in half a century. The scarcity of homes has helped drive up rents and home prices, pushing many families out of the city.</p><p>The housing plan is the third part of a broader City of Yes proposal to update the city’s archaic zoning rules. The Council already approved two other measures to prepare the city for climate change and to create new rules to boost businesses; the housing initiative is being portrayed as a formal clap back to powerful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/13/nyregion/nimbys-pro-development-housing-league-antonio-reynoso-erik-bottcher.html" title="">“Not in My Back Yard’ neighborhood groups</a> who often decide the fate of housing developments.</p><p>The housing plan had many striking proposals: ending parking mandates for new housing in some neighborhoods; allowing “accessory dwelling units” such as backyard cottages and basement apartments; and adding housing above businesses on commercial streets in low-density areas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It would allow modest apartment buildings to be built near subway, bus and other transit stations in places where they are not currently allowed. And it would give developers an option to build bigger buildings than currently allowed if they include apartments restricted to lower- or moderate-income people or people who are struggling with homelessness.</p><p>But the Council chose to scale back some of the plan, voting to exempt single-family districts from development near transit stations. It also curtailed the backyard and basement measures, including in some flood-prone areas.</p><p>Many of the parking mandates remain in effect, but the revised proposal creates three zones with differing requirements.</p><p>Many pro-housing groups vigorously supported the plan. But it was opposed by some pro-tenant groups, who said it did nothing to improve affordability in the short term, and by people living in many low-density neighborhoods, who worried about the potential influx of new housing.</p><p>Republicans in New York City, who have been encouraged by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/trump-nyc-voters.html" title="">rightward shift among voters during the presidential election</a>, have strenuously opposed the housing plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Joseph Borelli, the Republican minority leader of the City Council, said that his district in Staten Island was not suited to high-density developments because it lacked critical infrastructure investments and transit.</p><p>“We’re going to give you more density with none of the improvements?” he said. “We’re a no.”</p><p>Some urban planning experts lamented the changes that were made to the plan.</p><p>“The City Council’s modifications evidence a preference for an incremental approach rather than the ‘everything, everywhere, all at once’ approach of the original proposal,” David J. Rosenberg, a land-use lawyer at the real estate-focused law firm Rosenberg &amp; Estis, said in a statement. “Building more housing is necessary but not sufficient. We need to build more housing in more neighborhoods.”</p><p>Many of the Democrats who are running for mayor against Mr. Adams supported the plan, including Brad Lander, the city comptroller, and Scott Stringer, the former comptroller. Still, Mr. Stringer said that the city must do much more to build housing.</p><p>“At the end of the day, this minimalist proposal is a small part of a long journey to make sure that working people can live and thrive in our city,” he said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
