The deaths, Mr. Bullock said, are the result of an “intentional denial of access to basic necessities like food, water, health care, hygiene,” in some cases combined with physical abuse.</p><p>Andrés Guzmán Caballero, the government’s human rights commissioner, rejected claims that prisoners were dying from intentional neglect or abuse, or at a higher rate than the civilian population, including from the effects of malnutrition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“That’s completely false,” he said in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Guzmán Caballero could not provide an exact number of prisoner deaths but said that there is “very low” mortality in the country’s two dozen penitentiaries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andrés Guzmán Caballero, the government’s human rights commissioner, in his office in San Salvador.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>American lawyers for the migrants sent to El Salvador by the Trump administration and several members of the U.S. Congress have pressed officials for information on the men.

They can now go out when they please, play soccer, walk dogs. They are no longer shaken down by teenage gang members, asked to turn over food or property, or their daughters. Emergency rooms that once overflowed with gang victims are calm.</p><p>“You were like a little stray animal: there one day and gone the next,” said Teresa Lemus, a street vendor. “Now we’re 100 percent safe. I can carry my cash in my bag.”</p><p>Ms. Lemus’s brother was among those imprisoned for more than a year amid the crackdown despite his disability, a spinal condition that left him reliant on leg braces.</p><p>“Sooner or later, he’ll be proved innocent,” she recalled telling people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Teresa Lemus, street vendor, in San Salvador.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>She was right. But the letter exonerating her brother came too late, after he died this year in a prison called El Penalito, at 48. When she saw him in the morgue, he was emaciated. The explanation for his death, she said, was vague — depression, anemia.</p><p>Still, Ms. Lemus does not blame Mr. Bukele.</p><p>“I’m very clear that the president hasn’t done me wrong in any way,” she said. “Just as he has hurt us in some ways, he has helped us in others.”</p><p>Her brother, she is sure, would have said the same. </p><p>Such complexity can be found all over El Salvador, with people praising Mr. Bukele’s drastic measures even as they disclose their personal toll.</p><p>Adonay García dropped out at age 12 because of warring gangs at his school, he said. Now 19, he can safely ride a rented bike downtown. Yet at the peak of the mass arrests, he said, he was detained for a month, interrogated and struck by guards.</p><p>“I thought, ‘I am never going to see my family again,’” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adonay García was detained amid mass arrests and held by the authorities for a month.

That little man is trying to play God.” </p><p>Those who have spoken out include the parents of the disappeared, who march through the capital carrying posters with their children’s photos. Among them are Mr. Vega and his wife, Marta González, who just buried their youngest son.

They were crammed three to a bunk, forced to split meager rations like watery beans or instant pasta. The man said he lost 30 pounds in a month.</p><p>Ultimately, he said, he was placed with a group of “civilians without tattoos,” people considered “collaborators, in theory.”</p><p>Then he was sent to a less restrictive prison facility north of San Salvador, known as Mariona. There, detainees could leave their cells, kick a ball and play dominoes. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>But beyond routine checks, including weigh-ins, there was no medical care, the man said.

It’s not a five-star hotel but everybody eats two, three times a day and they eat well.”</p><p>On a recent morning, outside a prison in the inland city of Santa Ana, a man sitting in the back of a van held up his cuffed hands as the vehicle idled.
