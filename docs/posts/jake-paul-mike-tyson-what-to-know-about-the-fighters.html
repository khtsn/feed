The Paul-Tyson fight will take place after three other matches that start at 8 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>The generational showdown is part of the streaming service’s growing ambitions for live programming. It will also test the knowledge of fans: Some watched Tyson dominate the heavyweight division in the 1980s, while others followed along online as Paul catapulted to fame in the late 2010s.</p><p>If you want to catch up quickly before the fight at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, home of the Dallas Cowboys, here are some key moments from Tyson’s and Paul’s careers.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-386957bd">JAKE PAUL</h2><h2 id="link-28f3dc3a">The Entertainer</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/13/tyson-paul-68710-cover/tyson-paul-68710-cover-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/13/tyson-paul-68710-cover/tyson-paul-68710-cover-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/11/13/129596_1_tyson-paul-68710_wg_mobile_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Logan Paul Via Youtube</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Paul, who was raised in Ohio and has more than 27 million Instagram followers, first became known for short videos on the now-defunct social platform Vine before switching to YouTube.

Later that year, Paul defeated Nate Robinson, a retired professional basketball player, by knocking him out in the second round.</p><p>Paul now has a 10-1 record, although the quality of his competition is mixed. Many of Paul’s opponents, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/sports/jake-paul-anderson-silva.html" title="">such as Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva</a>, were aging mixed martial arts fighters who had to adapt to the limits of boxing (mixed martial arts fights can include kicking and wrestling; boxing allows only punches).
