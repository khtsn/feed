He added that Kyiv had information that “there are many more such Chinese citizens in the enemy’s units,” without providing evidence. The claims could not be independently verified, and there was no immediate comment from the Chinese or Russian governments.</p><p>The announcement came at a fraught moment for Ukraine as the Trump administration has seemingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-ukraine.html" title="">drawn closer to Russia</a> while trying to act as a mediator in cease-fire talks.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky on Tuesday did not suggest that the Chinese fighters had been sent by China’s military, but he pointed to their presence as further evidence that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was not truly interested in peace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Russia’s involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war. He is looking for ways to continue fighting,” he wrote on social media.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said that he had instructed his foreign minister to “immediately contact Beijing and clarify how China intends to respond to this.” The foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, confirmed that he had summoned the Chinese chargé d’affaires to demand an explanation.</p><p>“Chinese citizens fighting as part of Russia’s invasion army in Ukraine puts into question China’s declared stance for peace,” Mr. Sybiha wrote on social media.</p><p>Both Russia and Ukraine have had foreign fighters in their ranks throughout the more than three years of war. In most cases they are foreign volunteers or mercenaries, though Russia’s military has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-north-korea.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">enlisted the help of North Korean soldiers</a>.</p><p>The presence of Chinese nationals on the front lines in Ukraine has never been reported in Chinese state media. However, there have been unverified reports on social media in China of mercenaries from the country fighting in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>While China has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/us/politics/biden-scholz-ukraine-china.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">claimed neutrality</a> in the war, Beijing has provided the Kremlin with both diplomatic and economic backing during the conflict, support that the Biden administration said allowed Russia to sustain its offensive.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Vladimir V.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, and Mr. Putin have met numerous times and deepened their countries’ ties to include more military cooperation.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky’s announcement about the Chinese fighters came hours after he confirmed for the first time that Ukrainian forces were operating in the Belgorod region of Russia.</p><p>The New York Times reported last month that Ukrainian troops had been making <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/ukraine-attack-russia-belgorod.html" title="">a new cross-border push</a>, into Belgorod, after being driven out of the Kursk region. Military analysts said that the aim of the operation might be to divert Russian forces away from Kursk — where Ukraine’s troops lost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/world/europe/ukraine-kursk-retreat-russia.html" title="">nearly all of the territory</a> seized in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/world/europe/ukraine-kursk-retreat-russia.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">cross-border offensive</a> last summer — or to gain a new patch of land that could serve as leverage in peace negotiations.</p><p>In his nightly address on Monday, Mr. Zelensky said that military operations in Kursk and Belgorod were aimed at protecting Ukrainian regions on the other side of the border. Calling the moves “completely justified,” he added, “The war must return to where it came from.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Varenikova covers Ukraine and its war with Russia.</p></div><div><p>David Pierson covers Chinese foreign policy and China’s economic and cultural engagement with the world.
