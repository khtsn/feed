western Kursk region, which Ukraine invaded in August, as Ukrainian forces braced for what they said could be imminent assaults involving the new troops.</p><p>The Pentagon said North Korea had now sent about 10,000 soldiers to train in eastern Russia, with many moving toward the battlefield in the Kursk region. The NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Monday confirmed that North Korean troops had been deployed in Kursk, saying it represented “a dangerous expansion” of the war.</p><p>Ukrainian and American officials said last week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/europe/north-korean-troops-arrive-kursk-russia.html" title="">several thousand North Korean troops had already arrived in the Kursk area</a>. Military experts say that is too small a number to affect the overall situation on the broader battlefield, where both sides have deployed hundreds of thousands of soldiers, but potentially enough to help Moscow reclaim its territory in the Kursk region.</p><p>“As their numbers grow, I expect their impact to be seen by the progress of a steady Russian counterattack,” said John Foreman, a former British defense attaché in Moscow and Kyiv.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is unclear, however, how exactly North Korean troops will support Russia’s counterattack in the Kursk region. Analysts say the soldiers could be used in direct attacks or to guard areas behind the combat zone, thus freeing up Russian troops for assaults, but their effectiveness in battle is untested and could be hampered by coordination issues with the Russians.</p><p>On Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/12188" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the North Korean troops were expected to enter combat operations early this week. A Ukrainian soldier fighting in the Kursk area said he had been warned by his commanders that an assault could be imminent.</p><p>“They have warned us about an attack in the near future,” Lt. Col. Artem Kholodkevych, the deputy commander of Ukraine’s 61st Mechanized Brigade said on Saturday by text message. “Probably in the next few days.”</p><p>The Ukrainian Army has also issued a <a href="https://t.me/informnapalm/23247" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian-Korean phrase book</a> for its troops to address North Korean soldiers and urge them to surrender, according to a Ukrainian officer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p><p>Russian forces have been battling to reclaim hundreds of square miles of land seized by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-offensive.html" title="">surprise cross-border offensive in August</a>. In recent weeks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion.html" title="">Russia has regained several villages</a>, and military experts say the deployment of North Korean soldiers could bolster Russian counterattacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Russia’s total recapture of the Ukrainian-occupied area would undermine one of the main goals of Kyiv’s cross-border offensive: seizing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-incursion.html" title="">land it could use as leverage to push Moscow toward negotiations to end the war</a>.</p><p>But how the North Koreans will fare on the battlefield remains to be seen, the experts say.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Viewers in Seoul watched a television news report last week showing soldiers believed to be from North Korea standing in line to receive supplies in Russia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahn Young-Joon/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>North Korean troops have not fought in a war since the 1950s and, if sent to the front line, would face battle-hardened Ukrainian soldiers. Sabrina Singh, the deputy press secretary for the U.S. Defense Department, said on Monday that she did not have details on the type of troops North Korea was sending or what kind of weapons they had.</p><p>Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian colonel now working for the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, said that coordinating them with Russian troops would also prove complex because they don’t speak the same language, have been trained differently and are not familiar with the terrain where they will fight.</p><p>“It could be a huge headache for the Russian Army, which is not used to having large foreign units under its command,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington and chairman of the Munich Security Conference.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Ukrainian military intelligence services <a href="https://t.me/DIUkraine/4725" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Russia planned to assign one interpreter for every 30 North Korean soldiers to better coordinate with Russian troops on the battlefield. That claim could not be independently verified.</p><p>Ukraine’s surprise offensive in Russia’s western Kursk region in August enabled it to quickly seize around 400 square miles of territory. Since then, the Russian Army has recaptured nearly half of that area, but its response has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/world/europe/russia-ukraine-incursion-war.html" title="">hampered by a slow deployment of troops there</a>. Military experts say this is largely attributable to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-kursk.html" title="">Kremlin’s decision to prioritize its offensive in eastern Ukraine</a> over its response to the Ukrainian assault on its own territory.</p><p>Still, the presence of Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region has been a thorn in the side of President Vladimir V. Putin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/world/europe/ukraine-russia-incursion-putin.html" title="">shattering his promise that Russia was safe from attack</a> and exposing his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/world/europe/russia-kursk-ukraine-invasion-civilians.html" title="">inability to protect civilians living in the borderlands</a>.</p><p>In recent days, Mr. Putin has <a href="https://t.me/tass_agency/281741" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hailed his troops’ success in retaking villages</a> captured by the Ukrainians. “He’s determined to evict them from Russia and it has taken too long for his liking,” Mr. Foreman said.</p><p>Mr. Kevliuk of the Center for Defense Strategies in Kyiv said he expected the North Korean troops to be used in assaults against Ukrainian positions, following Russia’s long-held strategy of overwhelming the other side with waves of ground attacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“North Korean units will storm the most fortified positions” of the Ukrainians “and Russian regular troops will consolidate the captured objects and lines,” Mr. Kevliuk said. “The Russian tactic is unchanged: to realize a numerical superiority in personnel with artillery support.”</p><p>Kyiv says that Russia has deployed roughly 50,000 troops in the Kursk region, and has not reported the number of Ukrainians deployed there. Independent military analysis suggests that Ukraine has deployed about 30,000 soldiers. An additional 10,000 North Korean troops could allow Russia to overwhelm Ukrainian forces, experts say.</p><p>“Given their numbers, it is possible that they will have an impact on the conduct of hostilities in certain areas,” Colonel Kholodkevych said of the North Korean troops.</p><p>Mr. Foreman said he expected the North Koreans instead to “remain on the defensive and shore up the front line,” leaving some Russian soldiers free for offensive operations.</p><p>If they are used for direct attacks, he added, “the reliability of North Korean troops will be doubted by the Russians and using them may expose Russian troops.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The involvement of North Korean troops in the war has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/politics/north-korea-russia-ukraine.html" title="">raised concerns in the West</a>. On Monday, a delegation of officials from South Korea, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/asia/north-korea-ukraine-russia.html" title="">which was the first to report the deployment</a>, briefed NATO on the situation at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels.</p><p>“The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security,” Mr. Rutte <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_230105.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said after the briefing</a>. “It undermines peace on the Korean Peninsula and fuels the Russian war against Ukraine.”</p><p>Eric Schmitt<!-- -->, <!-- -->Steven Erlanger<!-- --> and <!-- -->Evelina Riabenko<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>North Korean Troops:</strong> Ukraine is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/europe/ukraine-braces-for-russians-to-assault-with-north-korean-troops.html">bracing for assaults involving North Korean soldiers</a> who arrived in Russia’s western Kursk region, where they are expected to support Moscow’s efforts to dislodge Ukrainian forces who invaded in August.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russia’s Interest Rate:</strong> Russia’s central bank raised the cost of borrowing in the country to its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/europe/russia-interest-rate.html">highest level in more than two decades</a> in an effort to slow inflation that is being fueled by record military spending and recruitment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Draft-Dodging Scandal:</strong> Ukraine’s prosecutor general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/europe/ukraine-draft-scandal-conscription.html">resigned amid a scandal</a> in which hundreds of officials are accused of obtaining fake disability certificates that allowed them to avoid military service.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
