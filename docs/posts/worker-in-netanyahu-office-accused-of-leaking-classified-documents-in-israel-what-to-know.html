Key members of his governing coalition had threatened to quit if he made concessions to Hamas.</p><p>On Sunday, an Israeli court partially lifted a gag order to identify Eliezer Feldstein, who was hired last year to work as a spokesman in Mr. Netanyahu’s office, as a suspect in the case. Three other suspects in the case are members of the military and security establishment, according to the court, and have not been publicly named.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The investigation has revolved around the publication and manipulation of real and purported intelligence information in media outlets abroad, according to Israeli news reports and to an Israeli official who was not authorized to discuss sensitive information, including the case. The London-based Jewish Chronicle published — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/jewish-chronicle-uk-fabricated-stories-owner.html" title="">and then retracted</a> — a report claiming Hamas was planning to smuggle Israeli hostages from Gaza to Egypt. A classified document that was leaked to the German newspaper Bild claimed that Hamas was trying to manipulate the Israeli public and wanted to draw out the negotiations.</p><h2 id="link-28999e37">How did this all get started?</h2><p>On Sept. 1, the Israeli military announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/hersh-goldberg-polin-hostage-gaza.html?smid=url-share" title="">six Israeli hostages had been found dead</a> in a tunnel in Gaza after being fatally shot by their captors, prompting a surge of mass protests and a wave of national anger and grief.</p><p>About 100 people taken captive by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, remain in Gaza. At least a third of them have been declared dead by the Israeli authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators supporting the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza scuffle with mounted police officers as the protest blocked a main highway in Tel Aviv on Sept. 1.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Sept. 2, in a televised news conference, Mr. Netanyahu presented his arguments for a new condition for a cease-fire deal with Hamas: Israel must maintain a permanent presence in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-philadelphi-corridor-gaza.html" title="">the Philadelphi Corridor</a>, a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Without that presence, Mr. Netanyahu said, Hamas could smuggle hostages across the border into Egypt’s Sinai Desert, and from there to Iran or Yemen, where he said they could disappear forever.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He also displayed a handwritten document in Arabic that he said was the work of high-ranking Hamas members, which he said had been found in January by Israeli soldiers in an underground command post in Gaza.</p><p>The document contained instructions for increasing the psychological pressure on Israel by issuing videos and images of hostages and casting doubt on the Israeli government’s narrative that its ground operation in Gaza would help release the hostages. Mr. Netanyahu said it showed Hamas’s strategy of sowing internal discord in Israel and suggested that the popular protests against his government played into Hamas’s hands.</p><h2 id="link-614c46cf">When did the leaks happen?</h2><p>On Sept. 5, soon after Mr. Netanyahu’s news conference, The Jewish Chronicle, a British community newspaper, published a report by a freelance journalist. The journalist, Elon Perry, claimed he had obtained Israeli intelligence showing that the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, was preparing to flee Gaza, via the Philadelphi Corridor, to Iran, and to take Israeli hostages with him.</p><p>The report cited intelligence gleaned from a senior Hamas official who was interrogated by Israel and from documents seized on the day the bodies of the six hostages were recovered.</p><p>Asked about the report in The Jewish Chronicle, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, <a href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/b1iy11zr20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that he was unaware of any such intelligence or plan by Mr. Sinwar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Jewish Chronicle later removed that story and others written by Mr. Perry from its website and <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/conclusion-of-jewish-chronicle-investigation-into-elon-perry-daaqr8b9" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ended its association</a> with him. The incident cast a cloud on The Chronicle, a 180-year-old newspaper whose ownership has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/world/europe/jewish-chronicle-uk-fabricated-stories-owner.html" title="">shrouded in mystery</a>.</p><p>On Sept. 6, a day after The Jewish Chronicle article ran, Bild <a href="https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/bild-exklusiv-zum-schaudern-das-plant-der-hamas-chef-mit-den-geiseln-66d98503c0fd674dd9f5d092" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an article</a> it said was based on a Hamas document laying out its plan for psychological warfare against Israel on the hostage issue, claiming that Hamas was in no rush to reach a deal or end the war. Some of the messaging was similar to points Mr. Netanyahu made in his news conference.</p><p>The Israeli military issued a statement on Monday saying it appeared that the document cited in the Bild article was found about five months ago and was “written as a recommendation by middle ranks in Hamas, and not by Sinwar,” as the Bild headline may have suggested. The document contained information similar to that found in earlier documents, the military said, adding, “The leaking of the document constitutes a serious violation.”</p><p>Critics say the exposure of the purported intelligence appeared to be part of a disinformation campaign by Mr. Netanyahu or by his supporters, intended to dampen the campaign for the hostages’ release and influence Israeli public opinion in favor of the prime minister’s negotiating positions.</p><h2 id="link-1fecc20c">Was Netanyahu involved?</h2><p>Mr. Netanyahu has not been questioned about the allegations and his office has denied leaking information. Many details of the case remain murky because of the gag order.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In one of its first statements about the affair, Mr. Netanyahu’s office said on Friday that nobody from his office had been questioned or detained. On Saturday, the prime minister’s office offered a different version, saying that the suspect in question — later revealed to be Mr. Feldstein — had never participated in security discussions and had not seen or received classified information.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office also accused the authorities of carrying out a selective investigation, arguing that numerous reports based on leaked information had been published during the war without any consequences. It described the investigation as “aggressive and biased.”</p><h2 id="link-63ad6eb6">How has the public reacted?</h2><p>Israel has been in uproar over the revelations that seeped out during the weekend. Prof. Hagai Levine, an Israeli public health expert who is active in the campaign to bring the hostages home, <a href="https://x.com/HagaiLevine/status/1853154542206280138?t=dqMNFAcH4_brbiHKmFcnpA&amp;s=08" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a social media post on Sunday that “the hostages scam of Netanyahu’s office appears to be more serious than the Watergate affair that led to the resignation of President Nixon.” He described the allegations as a “combination of the abandonment of the abductees, breach of trust and the undermining of state security.”</p><h2 id="link-7ef25e69">What are the latest developments?</h2><p>In the first official acknowledgment of the suspected security breach, a magistrate’s court in central Israel on Friday partially lifted the gag order on the case.</p><p>The court ruling stated that several people had been detained as part of a joint investigation by the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency, the Israeli police and the military.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The judge, Menahem Mizrahi, said they were suspected of “a security breach due to the illegal transfer of classified information,” as well as putting sensitive information and sources at risk, and harming the chances of achieving the war’s objectives in Gaza.</p><p>In a subsequent ruling on Sunday allowing the publication of Mr. Feldstein’s name, the judge specified that the war objective he was referring to was the return of the hostages.</p><p>Ronen Bergman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- -->, and <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/bild-newspaper">Bild (Newspaper)</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yahya-sinwar">Yahya Sinwar</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
