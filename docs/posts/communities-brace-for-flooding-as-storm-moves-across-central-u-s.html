The heaviest rain so far, which has caused dangerous flooding, mostly fell in Arkansas and southern Missouri. Recovery efforts have been stunted in some areas by the weather, which may taper off through Sunday.</p><p>On Saturday, western Tennessee, southeastern Arkansas, western Mississippi and Louisiana will face severe risk from the storm. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Folks are going to have the potential for really all modes of severe weather, from tornadoes to damaging straight-line winds, up to large hail,” said Scott Unger, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Nashville. At times, the hail could be as large as golf balls, he said, with severe weather potentially lasting well into Saturday night.</p><p>The National Weather Service also warned of life-threatening flash flooding across the region and urged people to turn around if they came across washed-out roads, adding that most flood deaths occurred in vehicles.</p><p>Cities across the storm’s path, which include Little Rock, Ark.; Jackson, Miss.; and Memphis, are bracing for the worst. Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville, Ky., said in a news release that he expected the Ohio River to rise about 30 feet. Officials in St. Louis County, Mo., said that part of Interstate 44 would most likely be underwater by Sunday. Officials in Paducah, Ky., said they were installing floodgates and getting more pump stations.</p><p>In Louisville, Ky., the region’s sewage utility said the sewer system <a href="https://louisvillemsd.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had reached capacity</a> because of heavy rain, and asked customers to refrain from running washing machines and dishwashers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-id="100000010087644" data-source-id="100000010087644"><div slug="2025-04-02-storm-radar-embed" data-sourceid="100000010087644" id="embed-id-100000010087644">
