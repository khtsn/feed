But that move is not likely to come easy after Mr. Musk spent months backing Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and dismantling parts of the federal government, raising concerns that he had become an absentee leader at his various enterprises, including SpaceX, Tesla, the artificial intelligence company xAI and the social media platform X.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk’s time in government has been a decidedly mixed bag for his business empire. Tesla is particularly vulnerable after Mr. Musk’s popularity nose-dived when he slashed government jobs. Tesla dealerships became the target of protests as sales and profit fell. What’s more, the Republican budget bill now before the Senate would gut subsidies and policies that promote electric vehicles. Tesla’s stock has dropped about 14 percent this year, wiping around $180 billion off its market value.</p><p>Some of Mr. Musk’s companies have benefited from his proximity to the White House, with Mr. Trump at one point promoting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-buy-tesla-elon-musk.html" title="">Tesla cars on the White House lawn</a> and SpaceX harvesting more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html" title="">government tie-ups with Starlink</a>, its satellite internet service. X remains a powerful megaphone for Mr. Musk’s and Mr. Trump’s supporters. And Mr. Trump is a valuable ally with policy power who oversees agencies that regulate Mr. Musk’s businesses.</p><p>But Mr. Musk is the face of his companies, and his protracted time in Washington has raised alarms over how committed he is to his businesses. Some former workers at SpaceX and elsewhere have questioned his absence from the companies. Overall, it’s unclear if the tech billionaire’s Washington maneuvers will lead to long-term advantages for them.</p><p>“It became a mission critical thing to get the C.E.O. back in the office,” said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. “It’s not a moment too soon, quite frankly.”</p><p>How much time Mr. Musk will spend with his companies and outside of Washington now remains unclear. At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/30/us/trump-news#trump-elon-musk" title="">a news conference in the Oval Office</a> with Mr. Trump on Friday, Mr. Musk called his departure from the government “not the end of DOGE but really the beginning” and said he would continue to visit “and be a friend and an adviser to the president.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Elon’s really not leaving,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s going to be back and forth.”</p><p>Mr. Musk did not address how he would spend his time or how the change would affect his companies. He did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Tesla and SpaceX also did not respond to requests for comment. X and xAI declined to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>SpaceX’s Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas.

In May, Dylan Small, a former mechanic at the rocket company, posted on X that “morale is low” and “people are burned out.”</p><p>“Your presence used to drive a fire in the team,” Mr. Small wrote to Mr. Musk. “Please come back and walk the floor.”</p><p>In a message to The New York Times, Mr. Small said SpaceX’s work was largely the result of employees feeling “inspired,” with Mr. Musk playing “a huge role in that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since the start of Mr. Trump’s term, Mr. Musk has posted almost 1,000 times on X about SpaceX, which was half of the nearly 2,000 times he posted about DOGE, according to a tally by The Times. In that time, SpaceX has held two test launches of Starship, the rocket that Mr. Musk hopes will get humans to Mars, including one on Tuesday.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Musk gave an interview to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/27/elon-musk-spacex-starship-doge/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> — a news outlet he has typically shunned — and emphasized that he was “physically here” for SpaceX ahead of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/science/spacex-starship-launch-elon-musk-mars.html" title="">the Starship test launch</a> from the company’s Starbase rocket facility in South Texas.</p><p>The launch ended in an explosion, but Mr. Musk still made a point to declare his presence. He re-shared videos of himself in the SpaceX control center, as well as interviews with reporters and influencers talking about space travel.</p><p>At Tesla, Mr. Musk’s level of disengagement from the business became clear in April. He had seldom visited Tesla’s offices or factories since Mr. Trump’s inauguration but showed up at one of the company’s offices in Palo Alto, Calif., a few days ahead of an earnings call that month, according to two people familiar with his travel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Musk at a Tesla factory in Germany in 2022.

The timing of his question raised concerns from some attendees, since Mr. Trump had begun implementing tariffs two months earlier in February.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Days after Mr. Musk’s visit, Tesla reported that its vehicle sales fell 13 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, as profit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">plunged to its lowest level in four years</a>. New tariffs on imported auto parts have added to the financial pressures facing the company.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s political activities alienated buyers, said Matthew LaBrot, who worked in sales at Tesla in California. It became “a grind every day to sell a car when that did not used to be the case,” said Mr. LaBrot, who was fired after he set up a website critical of Mr. Musk. “A lot of it was Elon.”</p><p>Tesla executives have told people in recent months that Mr. Musk was not as involved in day-to-day details of the operations and was dialing in remotely for meetings more frequently than before his stint at DOGE, two people with knowledge of the conversations said. A Tesla board member has sometimes stepped in to help fill in the gaps for Mr. Musk, one of them said.</p><p>Tesla, which faces stiff competition from Chinese electric carmakers such as BYD, has tried to diversify more into A.I. and robotics. Mr. Musk has said the company would launch a ride-hailing service this month in Austin, Texas, with fully autonomous vehicles. The company has also aimed to start making a less expensive car, though it is unclear how different it will be from Tesla’s existing vehicles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>During his time in government, Mr. Musk appears to have kept an eye on the fast-evolving field of A.I. He talked up xAI, his start-up, and posted hundreds of times on X about Grok, the chatbot made by the start-up. He also continued waging a legal battle against Sam Altman, who leads OpenAI and is a key rival in the A.I. industry.</p><p>In March, Mr. Musk sold X to xAI, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/technology/musk-x-xai.html" title="">merging the two companies</a>. Last month, the combined company announced a tender offer, which allows employees to cash out some of their equity by selling the shares back to the company at a prearranged price, according to internal documents seen by The Times. The tender offer is tentatively scheduled for this month and valued the combined company at about $113 billion, according to the documents.</p><p>On Wednesday, Linda Yaccarino, X’s chief executive, held an employee meeting to rally workers around the idea that merging with xAI had led to the best teams and technology, two people familiar with the discussion said. That day, she posted on X to celebrate a partnership to integrate Grok into the messaging service Telegram.</p><p>Pavel Durov, Telegram’s founder, also <a href="https://t.me/durov/422" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> about the deal. “Elon Musk and I have agreed to a 1-year partnership to bring xAI’s chatbot Grok to our billion+ users and integrate it across all Telegram apps,” he wrote.</p><p>A few hours later, Mr. Musk made clear he was still the boss. “No deal has been signed,” he posted on X.</p><p>Jack Ewing<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ryan Mac covers corporate accountability across the global technology industry.</p></div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
