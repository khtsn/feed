Navarro emerged from four months in federal prison, where he’d been imprisoned for contempt of Congress. Mr. Navarro had refused to testify in an investigation of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, an action he described as a defense of the Constitution.</p><p>Just hours after his release from prison, Mr. Navarro flew to Milwaukee to speak at the Republican National Convention in support of Donald J. Trump’s re-election.</p><p>“They convicted me, they jailed me. Guess what? They did not break me,” he said that night, punctuating each word as the crowd roared. It was an exercise in loyalty to Mr. Trump that seems to have paid off.</p><p>For much of Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Navarro, a trade adviser, had been sidelined, mocked and minimized by other officials who saw his protectionist views on trade as factually wrong and dangerous for the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But in the second Trump administration, Mr. Navarro, 75, an economist and trade skeptic, has been newly empowered. He returned to government more confident in his revanchist vision for the American economy, more dismissive of his critics, and with more than a dozen trade-related executive orders already drafted, many of which the president has since signed.

But they have serious criticisms of the tariffs, believing they will backfire on the economy by raising prices and slowing growth.</p><p>Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who studies trade, said Mr. Navarro “may be the worst trade adviser any modern U.S. president has ever had.”</p><p>Mr. Alden said that many of Mr. Navarro’s analyses — like how China and other countries had adopted unfair trade policies — had merit. But he said that Mr. Navarro had reinforced the president’s worst tendencies and fueled “chaotic tariff policies that are harming the American and global economies.”</p><p>“He has enabled the president to turn the United States from the world’s economic leader into a rogue nation,” Mr. Alden said.</p><p>Mr. Navarro declined to be interviewed for this article. In a statement, he said he was carrying out Mr. Trump’s directives and vision, and that “going to jail was not just a demonstration of loyalty to the president but loyalty to the Constitution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Navarro also derided mainstream economists who opposed the Trump agenda as “the same damn fools who supported NAFTA, China’s entry into the W.T.O., and every other trade deal that was supposed to benefit America but only benefited Wall Street and the foreign nations screwing us. Those mainstream economists need to get out more often — maybe to Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin or Michigan,” he said.</p><p>Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, called him “an invaluable asset” and said,<strong> </strong>“Peter Navarro was decades ahead of mainstream ‘experts’ on how China’s unfair trade policies are undermining American workers.”</p><p>The Trump administration remains publicly unified around imposing significant tariffs, but some advisers are growing more worried about economic damage. Earlier this month, Mr. Navarro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/musk-navarro-tariffs-fight.html" title="">publicly sparred</a> over the tariffs with Elon Musk, who he dismissed as “a car assembler,” not a “car manufacturer.” Mr. Musk responded that the trade adviser was “dumber than a sack of bricks,” later adding that the comparison was “unfair to bricks.”</p><p>Mr. Navarro — part crunchy California academic, part pugnacious MAGA attack dog — is accustomed to insults. He has long been a punchline among Washington lobbyists, think tank experts and economists, who have cringed at his ideas and mocked him for his quirks, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/peter-navarro-ron-vara.html" title="">inventing a fictitious expert</a> named Ron Vara (an anagram of Navarro) he quoted in his books.</p><p>“It’s like appointing someone who believes the world is flat to be in charge of NASA,” said Bryan Riley, the director of the Free Trade Initiative at the National Taxpayers’ Union, a conservative lobbying group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But Mr. Navarro, a college professor of relatively modest means in an administration full of billionaires, seems driven purely by ideology and mission, not by a desire for money or acclaim. And he believes his ideas have already been vindicated.</p><p>“The academic community can’t be trusted to critique Trump economics,” Mr. Navarro said in an interview in January with The New York Times. “And they have a credibility problem because they’ve been crying this wolf. They did it all through the first term,” he said. “We’re right. They’re wrong.

He believed in the benefits of free trade, and in 1984, he published his first book, which featured a chapter defending it. (“I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said in the January interview.)</p><p>He taught business and economics, first in San Diego and then at the University of California, Irvine, where he became a tenured professor and worked for more than 20 years. He spent his nights lecturing and his days writing books (“Big Picture Investing” and “If It’s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks”) and appearing as a commentator on TV.</p><p>He wrote for well-regarded economic journals and coauthored a paper with someone who went on to win a Nobel Prize. A lover of fresh air and exercise, he also swam, biked and paddle-boarded, and competed in triathlons.</p><p>Mr. Navarro was also interested in politics. An environmentalist and social liberal, he ran for office repeatedly as a Democrat, and <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/peter-navarro-remarks-at-1996-dnc-convention/4639438" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke at the 1996 Democratic National Convention</a>. He also ran for San Diego mayor, in a campaign that was focused on blocking big developers.</p><p>It was China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 that flipped a switch for Mr. Navarro, on both the Democratic Party and his profession.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In the early 2000s, Mr. Navarro said, his U.C. Irvine students were starting to unexpectedly lose their jobs, and he began zeroing in on China’s effects on trade. Mr. Navarro assigned his students to research how the Chinese were able to price their products more cheaply than the rest of the world.</p><p>His <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/3063" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">key finding</a> was that it wasn’t just cheap labor driving prices, but a suite of predatory trading practices, including export subsidies, currency manipulation and a lack of protections for workers and the environment.</p><p>Those ideas fed into a trio of books he wrote on China. One of them, “Death by China,” which he wrote with Greg Autry and published in 2011, was made into a documentary narrated by Martin Sheen. In the film, Mr. Navarro interrogated corporate lobbyists from behind the camera, and commiserated with labor unions about how offshoring hurt American workers. The film was skewered in the press as hyperbolic, but it won an endorsement from Mr. Trump, who called it, “right on.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Navarro’s documentary “Death by China” found a fan in Mr. Trump. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Area 23A</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><p>Robert C.

Mr. Navarro’s “The Coming China Wars” was among them.</p><p>There are reasons to doubt whether Mr. Trump ever gave such an interview — Richard McGregor, the author of another book on that list, said he believed the blog post’s content was fake, and the original Chinese article cannot be found — but the item still prompted Mr. Navarro to exchange messages with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Navarro was an adviser to the 2016 campaign, and protectionist rhetoric resonated deeply with Mr. Trump’s base. After Mr. Trump won, Mr. Navarro was promised a prestigious position as head of the National Economic Council, he wrote in a 2022 book, “Taking Back Trump’s America.”</p><p>Instead, the position was given to Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, and, in Mr. Navarro’s description, a “globalist,” who would become his nemesis.

A strategy was deployed to stop Mr. Navarro from swooping into the Oval Office alone. Unlike other advisers, Mr. Navarro was not invited to speak at a weekly trade meeting, and would have to smuggle in his charts to give unscheduled presentations.</p><p>But Mr. Trump, who was also a trade skeptic at heart, would sometimes ask for Mr. Navarro in particular, saying, “Where’s my Peter?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-29"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Navarro said his boss was fond of saying, “Where’s my Peter?”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>Shortly after Mr. Navarro, along with Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, succeeded in getting the president to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, Mr. Cohn left the White House.

He <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/07/14/anthony-fauci-wrong-with-me-peter-navarro-editorials-debates/5439374002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sparred</a> with Anthony Fauci, the president’s former chief medical adviser, over using hydroxychloroquine for treating Covid, something Mr. Trump promoted and which Mr. Navarro continues to strongly support.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Mr. Navarro <a href="https://peternavarro.com/the-navarro-report/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">echoed</a> Mr. Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 election.

Upon his release, Mr. Navarro went directly to the campaign trail and campaigned for the president through Election Day.</p><p>There were few acts that could demonstrate Mr. Navarro’s loyalty to Mr. Trump more than serving jail time. At a rally in Greenville, N.C., in October, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Navarro, who sat in the audience, calling him “a strong voice on what you and I believe in.”</p><p>“Good job today.
