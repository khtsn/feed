Several hours later, the school district announced that the potential threat had been “neutralized.”</p><p>Damen Cooper, the interim schools superintendent, said in an email that the district became aware of the potential threat late Sunday night and could not elaborate, but that it was working with the local police to monitor the situation.</p><p>“I understand that this last-minute closure may cause inconvenience, but the safety of our students, staff, and entire school community is our highest priority,” the email said. The school district promised to provide updates to the community as they became available.</p><p>Renee Baskerville, the mayor of Montclair, said <a href="https://www.montclairnjusa.org/News-articles/News/Statement-from-Mayer-Baskerville-on-Todays-Schools-Closing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> that the school closings were a “precautionary measure” and that there was “no immediate threat.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The schools are closed so that the security concern can be investigated,” she said. “I also wanted to make clear that this security concern is isolated to Montclair schools and does not affect surrounding communities or institutions.”</p><p>Several hours later, Mr. Cooper advised the community that the potential threat had been “neutralized,” thanks to a collaboration with the Montclair Police Department. The Police Department could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>“I understand that this situation may have caused anxiety and disruption for our entire school community,” Mr. Cooper said. “Please know that every step taken was guided by our unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and families.”</p><p>Several private schools in the area remained open on Monday. Adriana LaVarco, the director of admissions at one of them, Fusion Academy, said the police had encouraged the school to stay open because the threat was to “one specific individual.”</p><p>Montclair, a township in Essex County, N.J., is about 20 miles from New York City by car. Threats to schools have become relatively common in recent years, but closures are more rare.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams’s Inner Circle: </strong>Two New Year’s Eve photos show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/eric-adams-new-years-eve.html">how much Mayor Eric Adams’s closest allies have transformed</a> after a series of scandals plunged his administration into crisis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside New York’s Migrant Shelters: </strong>A reporter and photographer spent eight months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/nyc-migrant-shelters.html">documenting life in the city’s shelter system for migrants</a>, through the eyes of those living there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Katz’s Deli’s Legal Woes: </strong>In 2011, the Zagat guide ranked the Lower East Side institution at No. 42 on its list of the city’s 50 most popular restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/nyregion/katz-deli-nyc.html">The honor would come back to bite</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Secret Weapon in the War on Rats: </strong>Katie, a 12-pound dog who’s killed nearly 500 of the pests this year, roams Brooklyn’s parks and streets in search of prey. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/katie-dog-rat-hunter.html">It’s not hard to find</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine</strong><strong>:</strong> Marina Khidekel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/marina-khidekel-hugimals.html">who founded Hugimals World</a> as an answer to her own anxiety, spends her Sundays watching “Hacks,” hanging out with other female founders and dropping in at a factory.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
