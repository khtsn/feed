Several hours later, the school district announced that the potential threat had been “neutralized.”</p><p>The teacher, Amir Doctry, was arrested in Philadelphia on Monday morning and charged with making terroristic threats, a spokesman for the Montclair Police Department, Lt. Terence Turner, said.</p><p>Mr. Doctry, a teacher at Northeast Elementary School, was put on administrative leave last week when he started showing signs of “erratic behavior,” Lieutenant Turner said. Mr. Doctry was in a “manic state” when he was apprehended and taken to a Philadelphia hospital for a psychological evaluation, Lieutenant Turner added.</p><p>The Montclair Police Department said it was increasing patrols around all schools out of an abundance of caution. The department added that there was “no further danger” to Montclair, a township in Essex County, N.J., that is about 20 miles from New York City by car. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Doctry is listed as a “long-term teacher” on the school district’s website, but he was not listed as a staff member in the Northeast Elementary School’s directory as of Monday afternoon.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-doctry-66036123b/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> for a user with his name says that he owns a business geared toward creating virtual-reality lessons for students and that he previously taught sixth-graders in Montclair and students in Newark.</p><p>Not long after the school district announced the school closure on Monday, parents began to speculate that it was connected to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPvypKksplI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a YouTube video</a> featuring Mr. Doctry. Lieutenant Turner confirmed the connection in an interview.</p><p>In the video, Mr. Doctry can be seen holding up a letterman jacket and saying that he believed he would be promoted to school superintendent and planned to get the title “superintendent” stitched onto the jacket once that happened.</p><p>“That is how confident I am that I am going to be the new superintendent of Montclair Public Schools,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He later added: “We need change. That is the whole point,” before making a series of remarks about artificial intelligence.</p><p>The video’s lengthy caption contained a string of profane, political and racist assertions. It read, in part: “Joe must die school shooting Montclair school shooting kills Dr. Joe Racsim Racist Joe is dead. He dies tonight.”</p><p>The school’s principal is listed as Dr. Joseph Putrino. Lieutenant Turner confirmed that Dr. Putrino, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the target of the threat.</p><p>Damen Cooper, the interim superintendent of Montclair Public Schools, had said in an email to parents early Monday that the district became aware of the potential threat late Sunday night and had decided to close schools to be safe.</p><p>“I understand that this last-minute closure may cause inconvenience, but the safety of our students, staff, and entire school community is our highest priority,” the email said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Several hours later, Mr. Cooper advised the community that the potential threat had been “neutralized,” thanks to a collaboration with the Police Department.</p><p>Matthew Frankel, who has two children in Montclair public schools, one of whom was tutored by Mr. Doctry during the pandemic, said the news had been a “shock to the system.”</p><p>“There was transparency within our community, and I think in a moment of crisis, that’s what we want as parents,” he said. “In terms of how we feel about this teacher, and even speculating on his mental state, I think the most important thing that we can do is to let the authorities do their job.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams’s Inner Circle: </strong>Two New Year’s Eve photos show <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/eric-adams-new-years-eve.html">how much Mayor Eric Adams’s closest allies have transformed</a> after a series of scandals plunged his administration into crisis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside New York’s Migrant Shelters: </strong>A reporter and photographer spent eight months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/nyc-migrant-shelters.html">documenting life in the city’s shelter system for migrants</a>, through the eyes of those living there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Katz’s Deli’s Legal Woes: </strong>In 2011, the Zagat guide ranked the Lower East Side institution at No. 42 on its list of the city’s 50 most popular restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/nyregion/katz-deli-nyc.html">The honor would come back to bite</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Secret Weapon in the War on Rats: </strong>Katie, a 12-pound dog who’s killed nearly 500 of the pests this year, roams Brooklyn’s parks and streets in search of prey. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/nyregion/katie-dog-rat-hunter.html">It’s not hard to find</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sunday Routine</strong><strong>:</strong> Marina Khidekel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/nyregion/marina-khidekel-hugimals.html">who founded Hugimals World</a> as an answer to her own anxiety, spends her Sundays watching “Hacks,” hanging out with other female founders and dropping in at a factory.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
