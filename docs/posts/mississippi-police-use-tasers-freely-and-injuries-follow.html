To reduce the chance of causing injury or death, they are advised to avoid shocking people who are elderly or who have heart conditions and to avoid shocking anyone for more than 15 seconds over the course of an encounter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Tasers are designed to make it easy for departments to monitor when officers violate rules like these. Each device electronically logs when it is triggered and for how long, creating a digital trail that can be used to flag excessive Taser use.</p><p>But dozens of departments across Mississippi remain in the dark about whether officers use the weapons properly because they do not examine their Taser logs, the news organizations found.</p><p>Several Mississippi agencies said they did not know they had access to the logs; at least six did not have the cable needed to extract data from a Taser, until The Times purchased a cable so those departments could provide reporters with copies of the logs.</p><p>The Times and Mississippi Today spent months gathering logs from across the state to do what these departments had not — a systematic review to identify excessive Taser incidents. Reporters analyzed more than 100,000 Taser log entries from 36 departments.</p><p>The logs alone do not show definitive cases of abuse, but they reveal serious red flags that departments could use to determine when officers fire their Tasers for longer than is considered safe. Over the past four years, Tasers across the state recorded more than 15 seconds of shock at least 600 times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The logs, combined with thousands of pages of police and court records and interviews with nearly 30 people who were shocked by the police, also<strong> </strong>revealed dozens of instances where officers shocked people in ways that violated widely accepted Taser use standards.</p><p>Some were lying on the ground or sitting in their cars at the time. At least 11 people have accused officers of shocking them while they were pinned down or handcuffed. None of them were armed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mississippi officers have often fired their Tasers for longer than is considered safe, increasing the risk of cardiac arrest and other life-threatening medical emergencies associated with the weapons.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Officers fired their Tasers — sometimes more than 10 times — at people who were slow to follow orders or who argued about why they were being arrested. They shocked at least 12 people who were in the midst of a mental health crisis and who had become irrational or unresponsive.</p><p>Often, the people they shocked had been accused of petty crimes, including trespassing and traffic violations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2021, Leake County deputies shocked 49-year-old Kevin Turner for refusing to put his hands behind his back even after he warned them that he had a defibrillator installed in his heart. He was arrested for disturbing the peace, a charge that was later dismissed.</p><p>The same year in Lee County, home to Tupelo, sheriff’s deputies fired their Tasers for more than two minutes in total while they arrested Christopher Thomas, who was hallucinating and fighting with deputies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A framed portrait of Keith Murriel at the home of his sister, Ebony Johnson, in Jackson, Miss.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Keith Murriel died in 2022 after Jackson police officers shocked him at least 40 times while they were trying to arrest him because he refused to leave a motel parking lot. He is one of at least 22 people to die in Mississippi shortly after being shocked by the police, according to news reports and state investigative records. It is unclear whether Tasers caused most of these deaths.</p><p>The actual number of excessive Taser activations is almost certainly far greater than The Times and Mississippi Today could tally. Dozens of agencies ignored public records requests for their logs or said they could not provide them. Among them were two of the state’s largest policing agencies — the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol and the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department, which includes Jackson.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In the absence of regular monitoring of the logs, many police agencies must trust accounts given by their officers.</p><p>As in many states, Mississippi law enforcement agencies generally require officers to file paperwork describing the details of any encounter where they use force. Many administrators said they do not compare those reports with the officers’ Taser logs to ensure their accuracy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cpl. Stephen Creel, with other officers in Magee, Miss., aims a Taser at a training target.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>This lack of oversight has led to serious abuse by some officers. The Times and Mississippi Today reported in 2023 that a group of Rankin County sheriff’s deputies who called themselves the Goon Squad used their Tasers to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/us/rankin-county-mississippi-sheriff.html" title=""> torture suspected drug users for decades.</a></p><p>Several former Rankin County deputies said that all they needed to do to keep their Taser use secret was to leave it out of their official reports. Department supervisors almost never compared the details in their reports to Taser logs, they said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>This lack of scrutiny also allowed deputies to invent false justifications for using their stun guns and to downplay how many times they shocked people without fear of being caught, according to the deputies.</p><p>“Nothing has ever been said to me about a Taser log, and I have never heard of anyone else being questioned about one,” said Christian Dedmon, a former deputy at the department who participated in many Goon Squad raids before being charged with the torture of two Black men in 2023.</p><p>Mr. Dedmon was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/us/dedmon-mississippi-goon-squad-sentencing.html" title="">one of six officers sent to prison</a> for shocking the two men with Tasers, beating them and shooting one of them in the mouth. He said departments could prevent similar abuses by randomly auditing their officers’ Taser logs.</p><p>Using the logs, reporters found at least 16 incidents at nine other departments where officers failed to accurately report their Taser use.</p><p>After reporters shared what they found in the logs with agencies across the state, officials in several departments said they would reconsider how they monitor Taser use. In Magee, Chief Denis Borges updated his department’s policies to require Taser log audits every six months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Top officials in many other departments, including Chief Billy McMillan of the Carthage police, whose officers shocked Ms. Burks, did not respond to requests for comment or said they were unable to explain their officers’ Taser deployments.</p><p>Some guessed that excessive Taser incidents could be officers fiddling with the weapons out of boredom or sparking them as a practical joke. Other department representatives said deputies had shocked aggressive dogs without filing a report. One deputy in Attala County said he used his Taser to kill spiders.</p><p>Rick Myers, former executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a professional organization for law enforcement leaders, said a department’s reluctance to track Taser use leaves it vulnerable to excessive force claims and misuse by officers.</p><p>“This is a massive leadership failure,” Mr. Myers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-33c81959">Taser’s Promise</h2><p>Tasers were first marketed to police departments thirty years ago as a tool that would revolutionize law enforcement. They promised to allow officers to subdue a suspect without injury, at the touch of a button. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>The devices use pressurized gas to fire two small darts connected to wires that deliver an excruciating shock that debilitates most people.</p><p>“It feels like fire running across your body,” said Seth Stoughton, a law enforcement instructor and former officer who has been voluntarily shocked by a Taser.</p><p>Taser International, which later changed its name to Axon Enterprise Inc., has become a global force in law enforcement equipment and is valued at nearly $50 billion.<strong> </strong>Today, Axon says that close to 20,000 police agencies around the world use its Tasers. The company promotes its line of weapons as a critical way to reduce deadly police encounters and has claimed credit for saving hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p>But as police agencies adopted Tasers in huge numbers in the early 2000s, doubts emerged about whether the devices were as safe as the company had claimed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Taser batteries charging at the police department in Magee, Miss. Some Taser models automatically download logs while the batteries charge.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>Several medical studies determined that repeated Taser shocks or shocks near the heart could cause cardiac arrest and other life-threatening conditions. Journalists found that a<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-links-stun-guns-to-deaths-30-11-2004/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> growing number of people were dying</a> after being shocked, and human rights groups raised concerns that the weapons could be used for torture. Because Tasers can cause a person’s muscles to spasm uncontrollably, there is also a risk of injuries caused by falling.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>In response, Axon advised police agencies in 2009 to avoid aiming at people’s chests. Two years later, the Justice Department and the Police Executive Research Forum, an influential law enforcement policy group, published more extensive recommendations for safer use.</p><p>The guidelines said officers should avoid shocking anyone who is not an immediate threat. They also advised officers to avoid shocking children and people who are elderly, pregnant or have a known heart condition.</p><p>Although the recommendations are not binding, law enforcement agencies across the country have incorporated them into their Taser policies. Federal courts in some parts of the United States have ruled that shocking someone who is not a clear threat can be a civil rights violation.</p><p>Many department policies across the country say that Tasers should be used only to incapacitate dangerous people so officers can quickly handcuff them while they’re down, and that officers should avoid shocking people for longer than 15 seconds over the course of an entire incident.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>Unsafe Taser use occurs in many places, but Mississippi has fallen behind because many police agencies in the state have not adopted these guidelines, and because its courts have been less stringent. In 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, whose rulings govern Mississippi, contradicted rulings handed down by other courts and decided that officers can shock someone simply for walking away against an officer’s orders.</p><h2 id="link-5f057cbe">The Scale of Abuse</h2><p>What happened to Vivian Burks is exactly the kind of incident that law enforcement officers are supposed to avoid.</p><p>Two experts who reviewed the encounter said that when Ms. Burks — an unarmed woman suspected of nonviolent offenses — did not put her hands behind her back, officers should not have escalated the confrontation, especially after she said she was ill.</p><p>“Because the Taser is a relatively high-level use of force, it has to correspond with a relatively significant threat or significant interference with a law enforcement objective,” said Ashley Heiberger, a former officer and use of force expert.</p><p>Mr. Stoughton, a professor at the University of South Carolina’s Excellence in Policing &amp; Public Safety Program, said that when Ms. Burks tried to climb into her car, the officers may have been concerned about her grabbing a weapon, but they should have stopped shocking her once she was on the ground.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><p>Instead, the officers used the Taser like a cattle prod to force Ms. Burks to comply,<span>  </span>Mr. Stoughton said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-35"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Burks was suspected of marijuana possession when officers used a Taser to subdue her.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><div><p>Ms. Burks, who was charged with driving under intoxication, marijuana possession and resisting arrest, exemplifies a troubling pattern of officers firing Tasers when their authority was challenged. The Times and Mississippi Today found similar cases across the state.</p><p>Because Taser incidents seldom cause major injury, the public rarely learns about them, but the allegations have occasionally shown up in lawsuits.</p><p>In 2021, Darius Harris argued with Lexington police officers when they threatened to arrest him for lighting fireworks on New Year’s Eve, so they shocked him in the chest with a Taser, according to a lawsuit he filed in federal court.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>The same year, a Jackson police officer shocked Aquinta Palmer three times while she was handcuffed after she argued with him, Ms. Palmer claimed in a federal lawsuit.</p><p>In 2016, a Lamar County sheriff’s deputy testified in court that he handcuffed Rusty Holloway and then shocked him repeatedly after he walked away from a car accident against the deputy’s orders.</p><p>In court filings, the three agencies denied wrongdoing by their officers. Two of the lawsuits have not been resolved; Mr. Holloway’s claim was eventually dropped.</p><p>Reporters identified 44 allegations of Taser abuse over the past decade from lawsuits and department records. They found hundreds more incidents that raise red flags by examining Taser logs across the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>On their own, the logs cannot show whether a Taser incident violated safety protocols. But the time stamps in the logs can help determine if an officer fired excessively and can flag suspicious events that deserve closer scrutiny.</p><p>The logs led reporters to the case of Dyquavis Graham, who was<span>  </span>shocked in the chest by a Magee police officer in 2020 after Mr. Graham argued with him about a traffic ticket, a police report shows. That same year, Simpson County sheriff’s deputies triggered their Taser for at least 35 seconds when Joshua Hall fought with them during his arrest, the logs showed.<span>  </span></p><p>Denis Borges, who was not Magee’s police chief at the time of the incident, said Mr. Graham’s arrest would have prompted an internal investigation under his watch. The Simpson County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to numerous requests for comment.</p><p>One of the most extreme Taser events captured in the logs involved the 2020 arrest of a former Army medic in Pearl, just outside Jackson.</p><p>Skylor Pruitt said he took drugs one night and began hallucinating that he was being chased. During the episode, he smashed his neighbor’s window, and she called the police.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-21"><div><p>Pearl police reports show that the officers arrived to find Mr. Pruitt screaming and slamming his head into the asphalt.</p><p>After Mr. Pruitt failed to obey commands to stay put, five officers fought with him as Mr. Pruitt thrashed on the ground. Logs obtained from the department show that<strong> </strong>three officers triggered their Tasers a total of 24 times, for a combined 136 seconds — nine times the generally accepted limit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-44"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marc Brown, lead instructor at the University of South Carolina Excellence in Policing &amp; Public Safety Program, urged restraint in the use of Tasers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Travis Dove for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-22"><div><p>Chief Nick McLendon of the Pearl police declined to say whether he considered the officers’ Taser use reasonable because he could not be sure how many times they successfully shocked Mr. Pruitt. In their reports, the officers stated that their first deployment misfired.</p><p>Mr. McLendon, who was not chief at the time of the incident, said limiting how many times his officers can deploy their Tasers could hamstring them in unpredictable situations. Instead, he requires officers to “make sure it’s reasonable.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-23"><div><p>But policing experts said they struggled to imagine a scenario in which officers could justify deploying their Tasers for so long.</p><p>Marc Brown, lead instructor at the University of South Carolina Excellence in Policing &amp; Public Safety Program, said officers should be prepared to handcuff someone immediately after the first successful Taser deployment to avoid risking officer safety and shocking someone longer than necessary.</p><p>“When you’re tasing someone that many times, especially if you have multiple officers, that to me is a problem,” he said.</p><h2 id="link-7cef0e91">A Lack of Accountability</h2><p>In some states, including Massachusetts, Minnesota and Georgia, legislators have enacted laws that regulate Taser use and training for law enforcement officers statewide.</p><p>In others, state agencies or police associations have created model polices to help guide local departments in setting their own rules.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p>Mississippi has neither.</p><p>If a police department in Mississippi seeks advice from state officials, the board that oversees police training in the state refers them to Axon.</p><p>The company provides general policy guidelines on its website as well as materials that departments use to train their officers. Both incorporate some of the best practices published by the Justice Department. But a company spokesperson said Axon leaves decisions on how to use Tasers up to local agencies.</p><p>The spokesperson did not respond to requests for additional comment.</p><p>In the absence of statewide regulations, departments in Mississippi have developed a patchwork of Taser policies that vary wildly, often straying from what experts consider to be the basic legal standards. Many are outdated.</p><p>A review of policies from 44 departments showed that while a few say officers can shock someone only in response to a violent attack, most agencies rely on vague definitions that are open to interpretation. Typical language states that officers should fire their Tasers only when they meet resistance, but the level of resistance is often unclear.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-50"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ebony Johnson, Keith Murriel’s sister, said his death has devastated her family.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p>For example, many agencies do not bar officers from shocking someone for walking away against orders.</p><p>More than half of the departments also do not address whether officers can shock children or people with medical conditions. Most do not bar officers from using Tasers against someone in handcuffs.</p><p>Only two agencies have guidelines for how long officers can shock someone. The Walthall Sheriff’s Department policy defines the Taser as a type of knife.</p><p>The lack of clear rules extends to how departments monitor Taser use, leaving most of them in the dark if officers fail to mention shocking people in their reports.</p><p>There was no way to know what occurred during hundreds of the suspicious Taser triggers reporters found in the logs because department officials could not provide incident reports that explained why the Taser was fired. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><div><p>Agencies that require officers to download Taser logs do not always enforce the policy. When a Taser is fired, each device records the event on the Taser itself. To review the logs, a department must connect each device to a computer and download the information. Several said they did not have the software required to do so. Jackson police officers are supposed to connect their weapons to a computer every month. But the department, when asked for copies of all its logs, could not locate the data for more than two-thirds of its Tasers. Agency officials said they would investigate why the files were missing.</p><p>At several departments, high-ranking administrators said that while they could access their logs, they did not use them to monitor officer Taser use.</p><p>Chief McLendon, of the Pearl police, said it could undercut the morale of his staff. “We give them badges and guns,” he said, “so there’s a level of trust there.”</p><p>But among the cases reporters found of officers failing to accurately report their Taser use was an incident involving the Pearl police.</p><p>In 2021, two Pearl officers reported triggering their Tasers once each while arresting a man who had taken drugs and resisted their attempts to keep him in an ambulance, but the Taser logs show they fired their weapons a total of 10 times.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p>When presented with this information, Mr. McLendon, who was not the chief at the time, said it would have prompted further review under his watch.

These responses were often incomplete. One department supplied only two months of data, while others omitted some of their weapons or provided corrupt files that could not be processed.</p><p>About 108,000 uses of the Tasers since 2020 were extracted from the 1.4 million rows of data logged. Each use represents one instance of pulling the trigger or pressing a button to generate electricity.</p><p>Taser logs do not indicate why the weapon was used, and many of these entries represent training sessions and test firings.<span>  </span>The most modern Tasers make identifying these easier, and more than 80 percent of them were removed from the analysis. Firings that occurred within an hour of updating the weapon’s time or software, or a burst of short events in a five-minute period, were also removed. This reduced the number of firings by almost half, to 63,000.</p><p>This set was collapsed into 44,000 incidents in which one or more Tasers were triggered for at least one second each over the course of an hour. Recorded shocks of less than one second were not included because of the likelihood that they were misfires. Events that would have fallen into multiple incidents were counted in the longest one. Of those, reporters manually reviewed the nearly 1,000 cases that lasted at least 15 seconds. About 400 were either identified by the departments as training and testing, or showed patterns typical of training operations, and were removed. Once the list was edited, the review found 611 incidents that lasted at least 15 seconds.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sarah Cohen is an assistant editor for computer-assisted reporting.
