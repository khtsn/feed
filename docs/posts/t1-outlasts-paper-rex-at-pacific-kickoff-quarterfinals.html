</span> 2-1 at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/champions-tour-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> quarterfinals.</p>

<p>This win breaks an almost two-year long spell of victories from Paper Rex over T1. Since April 2023, Paper Rex have won six flawless matches against T1, coming into today&#39;s match holding a 12-0 record over the Koreans.</p>

<p>“It&#39;s so great to finally get that win for the T1 organization. Historically we lost to them 2-0. Great game indeed,” <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/804/buzz">
		BuZz	</a>
</span> said after the match.</p>

<p>The bout was expected to be one of the most promising of Kickoff due to each team&#39;s offseason. T1 had become a strong contender thanks to a number of hot pickups while Paper Rex, who have not touched their roster since <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/17086/something">
		something	</a>
</span> joined, seemed back to their true selves at the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2228/valorant-radiant-asia-invitational" target="_blank">Radiant Asia Invitational</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://owcdn.net/img/678e60fdb6435.jpg" alt="VCT Pacific Stage with T1 colors"/>

<p>The match delivered, but only heated up in the final moments of Fracture. While T1 dominantly won their Bind pick, 13-6, Fracture was much more tightly contested. f0rsakeN came online on attack, dropping 17 players in just eight rounds.</p>

<p>The highlight that guaranteed a decider was unquestionably <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9801/f0rsaken">
		f0rsakeN	</a>
</span>&#39;s chaotic three kills outside B, which included a kill through a smoke. That round put Paper Rex on map point and allowed them to swiftly bring about Split.</p>

<p>The final map swung in T1&#39;s favor, and was the closest map of the match. In the penultimate round, <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> gunned down all of Paper Rex by himself, leaving the door open for his team to win the final map 13-11.</p>

<p>And while Meteor&#39;s ace may have been the highlight of the map, he was on par with his team for frags, but had the lowest ADR and rating. It was <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/485/stax">
		stax	</a>
</span> who guided the team to victory with a 1.64 rating and 24 kills for a +11 differential. His Split performance also made him the man of the match, averaging a 1.25 rating across the three-map fight.</p>

<p><em>Those last two kills were an accident… surely…</em></p>

<p>This win is also the second for T1 this year, and the 11th for the roster overall. T1 haven&#39;t dropped a match since they beat <span data-ref-id="7">

<p>“The BOOM series was our first game, so some of the players had stage jitters. I don&#39;t think we were as well prepared as we were today,” BuzZ said in the post-match interview. “We were able to spot some holes in our plays, some things we didn&#39;t do in scrims, so we were able to tighten tights up with the extra day that we had. We&#39;re pretty satisfied with how today went down.”</p>

<p>While BuzZ also thinks the worst is behind them — the team thought Paper Rex would be their highest hurdle come Kickoff and come 2025 — now is not the time to let up. There is still a long path to Thailand.</p>

<p>With T1&#39;s victory, they are now in the upper semifinals. They will next face <span data-ref-id="8">
