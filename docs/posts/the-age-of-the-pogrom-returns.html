Today, that would include the souls of women, among many other despondent Harris-Walz supporters.</p><p>George Washington made sure Paine’s words in his pamphlet The American Crisis (a kind colonial Substack newsletter) were read aloud to his battered troops at Valley Forge before they crossed the Delaware and eventually won the Revolutionary War.</p><p>As battle-weary Kamala Harris volunteers consider whether to return to the fray after a major defeat or become mere “sunshine patriots,” they should take note, as Washington did, of smaller but highly significant victories.</p><p>A longtime rule of thumb in politics is that a superior get-out-the-vote operation does not guarantee a win but it’s usually worth a point or two in the final results. That continued to be true in 2024, where Harris’s ground game was much stronger than Donald Trump’s.</p><p>So why didn’t it produce better outcomes? Trump compensated with devastating advertising (especially on trans high school students playing girls’ sports) and effective messaging on podcasts and social media.</p><p>This worked against Harris but was less successful further down the ballot, thanks to Democratic volunteers. While overall turnout appears to be slightly lower than in 2020 (the totals aren’t in yet), it has been higher than average in battleground states, which led to smaller-than-average margins and shorter coattails there for Trump.</p><p>While Harris has lost or is losing in all the battleground states, her troops helped turn out ticket-splitters who saved Senator Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, as well as other Democratic Senate candidates including Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, and, quite likely, Ruben Gallego in Arizona and Senator Jacky Rosen in Nevada — all by only a point or two.</p><p>Right now, it looks like the Senate will have 53 Republicans, a huge difference from a potential 57, which would have put Democrats in a deep, almost filibuster-proof hole.</p><p>So all the tapped-out donors, doorbell ringers, postcard senders and phone bank-sters need to know that without their efforts, the next decade would be much worse for the country, with Trumpist judges degrading the judiciary and reams of destructive bills passing the Senate.</p><p>With only four votes to spare (JD Vance will break any ties), Republicans now have less hope of a national abortion ban. They won’t have the support of Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and at least two or three other G.O.P. senators from red states that have approved abortion rights ballot initiatives.</p><p>The same will most likely go for gutting the civil service, abandoning NATO, confirming Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a cabinet post or elevating Judge Aileen Cannon to the Supreme Court. Probably not enough Senate votes.</p><p>In a dispiriting quirk, the Senate map in 2026 offers little chance for a Democratic pickup of more than a couple of seats at best.</p><p>The 2028 election will bring hope of returned Democratic control. But it wouldn’t if Senate Republicans could now boast an eight-vote majority.</p><p>Yes, all that money and toil from Harris supporters didn’t help elect a Democratic president. But we owe those volunteers what Paine called our “love and thanks.” They helped democracy stay alive to fight another day.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Nov. 8, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the source of Thomas Paine’s saying, “These are the times that try men’s souls.” It appeared in The American Crisis, not Common Sense.</p></div></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="32" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdkMDc3YWFjLWEwZmUtNTg4ZC1iYjUwLThhYTA4OTA1YWNjMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#israeli-attack-soccer-amsterdam-pogrom" data-source-id="100000009815931"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bret-stephens"><img alt="Bret Stephens" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-08T16:51:06.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 8, 2024, 11:51 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In April 1903 an antisemitic mob rampaged through the city of Kishinev, which was then part of the Russian Empire and is now known as Chisinau, the capital of Moldova. Nearly 50 Jews were murdered, women and girls were raped, and some 1,500 homes were destroyed. Among the survivors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/04/opinion/ukraine-russia-refugees.html" title="">were my paternal great-grandparents</a> Barnet and Bessie Ehrlich, who decided then and there to emigrate to America with their children.</p><p>This week there was another pogrom in Europe, this time in Amsterdam. “Barbarians on scooters are riding through our capital city hunting Israelis and Jews,” David van Weel, the Dutch minister of justice and security, <a href="https://x.com/ministerjenv/status/1854818432862044654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854818432862044654%7Ctwgr%5Efa3c45ad345ca8fea2ef44cd2a96b4b7f6af6f71%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.haaretz.com%2Fisrael-news%2F2024-11-08%2Fty-article%2Fisraeli-soccer-fans-attacked-in-amsterdam-by-assailants-chanting-free-palestine%2F00000193-0994-de12-adbb-8bf7c8ba0000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.

They broke my face, knocked out a tooth, cut my lip,” an Israeli fan, Yaakov Masri, told Israeli media after locking himself in his hotel room, with a table to block the door. He said that he and his son were set upon “by around 15 young Arab men, some of whom were armed with knives and clubs,” <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-11-08/ty-article/israeli-soccer-fans-attacked-in-amsterdam-by-assailants-chanting-free-palestine/00000193-0994-de12-adbb-8bf7c8ba0000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz</a>.</p><p>Some news accounts have pointed to provocative behavior by rowdy Israeli fans, including taking down a Palestinian flag and chanting anti-Arab slogans (in Hebrew), for contributing to the mayhem. They also noted heightened tensions connected to the war in Gaza.</p><p>Maybe. But that explanation ignores the many years of rising and virulent antisemitism in Europe that preceded the war, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/antisemitism-among-muslim-migrants-unsettles-a-germany-haunted-by-the-holocaust-ff359e73?st=NPQ73b&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much of it within Muslim communities</a>, along with evidence that the attacks were carefully and cunningly coordinated.</p><p>“Amsterdam authorities have contacted taxi platforms such as Uber and Bolt to discuss how drivers may have used the apps to screen Israeli phone numbers during the violence,” <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/israel-rescue-mission-antisemitic-attacks-amsterdam-6p7ffv06z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Times</a> of London reported.</p><p>To their credit, Dutch and other European leaders have been outspoken in condemning the pogrom, which came on the eve of the 86th anniversary of Kristallnacht. Willem-Alexander, king of the Netherlands, compared Thursday night to the country’s failure to protect Jews in World War II, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, wrote that “Jews must be able to feel safe in Europe.”</p><p>That’s a fine thought, though whether it will make any difference to the deteriorating situation for Jews in Europe remains to be seen. “Most of those arrested were later released,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/world/europe/amsterdam-israel-soccer-fans-attacked.html" title="">The New York Times reported</a>, and El Al sent planes to bring Israelis home. If a reminder were ever needed of why Israel, for all of its travails, came into existence in the first place, this latest pogrom was it.</p><p>My advice to Europe’s besieged Jewish communities: Remember what Kishinev foreshadowed — and please get out while you still can.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzkyYTk3MTllLTMyNGYtNWYzNS04MmZkLWM2OTc3NGVjNzI5YQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#global-reaction-trump-leaders" data-source-id="100000009814824"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/serge-schmemann"><img alt="Serge Schmemann" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-07T22:19:15.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 7, 2024, 5:19 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Foreign leaders have quickly lined up in the last two days to congratulate Donald Trump on his election victory, but behind the diplomatic rituals are fears, hopes and many questions over what the return of “America first” will mean for a troubled world. The refrain, everywhere, has been: Do not try to predict Trump’s actions.</p><p>The leader with the most to worry about was among the most effusive in his congratulations: President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine wrote on X that his first call with Trump on Wednesday was “excellent”; earlier he had hailed Trump’s “peace through strength” approach, which, he said, would “undoubtedly benefit” both countries. In fact, during the presidential campaign Trump had little nice to say about Zelensky or Ukraine, and there was rampant speculation that his new administration would push for a cease-fire that could leave a fifth of Ukraine under Russian control.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the Kremlin was said to be relatively happy. A source in Vladimir Putin’s administration told the independent Meduza news site that the first Trump administration may have laid new sanctions on Russia, but Trump was still somehow “<a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/11/06/putin-administration-hoped-a-harris-win-in-the-u-s-election-would-lead-to-another-january-6-but-have-soft-spot-from-trump-kremlin-insiders-say" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our guy</a>.” Still, Putin himself did not line up to congratulate Trump. “Let’s not forget that we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in the war against our state,” said his spokesman.</p><p>Jerusalem rejoiced, or at least at the offices occupied by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing ministers. Netanyahu had just fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who shared the Biden administration’s calls for restraint in Gaza, and now saw the way open to run Israel’s wars and politics the way he and his nationalists wanted to. Netanyahu congratulated Trump on “history’s greatest comeback.”</p><p>The U.S.’s North American neighbors were less sanguine. Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, tried to reassure her citizens that “there’s nothing to worry about,” but everybody knew otherwise: Trump’s campaign promises included punishing tariffs, mass migrant deportations and more if Mexico fails to stop “the onslaught of criminals and drugs.”</p><p>Up north, feelings were also muddled. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, congratulated “Donald” on his victory and said he looked forward to working with him. But Trudeau himself is in political trouble, and in the past he has been called a “far-left lunatic” and “two-faced” by Trump. “A lot of Canadians are feeling unsettled today,” said Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.</p><p>In Europe, Germany was even more unsettled, in part because the news from Washington coincided with the (unrelated) collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition. The Berlin government had cultivated special relations with the Biden administration in the interests of trans-Atlantic relations and the NATO alliance, neither of them pet projects of Trump.</p><p>The biggest question mark was China. Trump has called the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, both “brilliant” and “dangerous,” and things could go either way. Trump pledged in his campaign to impose a devastating 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports, which would lead to a major trade war. But the Chinese also see potential for expanding their global clout in Trump’s unilateralism.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzk5YWZmODZmLTdmMGQtNTlkMy1hMTIxLTc1YTkwNzk1MWFjZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#kamala-defeat-howard-university" data-source-id="100000009813701"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessie-wender"><img alt="Jessie Wender" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-07T20:59:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 7, 2024, 3:59 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mia Butler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kamala Harris conceded the presidential election on Wednesday at her alma mater, Howard University, almost 40 years after she graduated.

But it’s not that simple.</p><p>There’s a long chain of causality from Trump’s victory to the dollar’s rise, which might seem convoluted to the average voter but is instantly recognizable to professionals in the financial markets, and it has nothing to do with betting that Trump will be a good steward of the U.S. economy (although certainly some on Wall Street do believe that he will be).</p><p>Here’s the chain: The dollar rose mainly because Trump has promised to raise tariffs sharply. Higher tariffs would raise the prices Americans pay for imported products. That would lift inflation. The Federal Reserve would then have to fight the inflation by raising interest rates, or at least cutting rates less than it would have to otherwise. And higher interest rates on U.S. debt would attract global investors, raising the demand for dollars. Because traders expect that to happen, they aren’t waiting. They’re buying dollars now.</p><p>As I said, it’s convoluted but standard economics. As Olivier Jeanne and Jeongwon Son of Johns Hopkins University wrote in an economic <a href="https://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2023/SonJW/NonThesisPapers/NonThesisPaperSonJW.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working paper</a> last month: “In theory, tariffs should be partially offset by a currency appreciation in the tariff-imposing country or by a depreciation in the country on which the tariff is imposed.” The dollar’s rise makes foreign goods less expensive, so it offsets some of the effect of the tariffs, which won’t make Trump and his economic advisers happy.</p><p>Wall Street economists put their finger on the connection between tariffs and the dollar in commentary on Wednesday. “A looming global tariff war is taking the U.S. dollar up to a one-year high,” David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research in Toronto wrote. The U.S. economics team of Nomura, the Japanese securities firm, said that higher inflation from tariffs is likely to keep the Fed from cutting rates as quickly as it would otherwise. “We now expect just one Fed cut in 2025, with policy on hold until the realized inflation shock from tariffs has passed,” they wrote.</p><p>Bottom line: The stronger dollar is not going to make America great again.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg0YWEzZGJiLTc0NWItNWY4Yi1hMGExLTRjMTc1NGFjMjYxNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#harris-concession-democracy" data-source-id="100000009812098"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-06T21:52:31.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 6, 2024, 4:52 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Less than 12 hours after the presidential election was called early Wednesday morning, Vice President Kamala Harris did what Donald Trump still can’t bring himself to do four years after his own loss: She conceded.</p><p>“Earlier today I spoke to President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory,” she said Wednesday afternoon, speaking before dejected supporters at Howard University in Washington. “I also told him that we will help him and his team with his transition, and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.” That principle, she said, is what distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny.</p><p>She performed this task with clarity and grace, a fairly low bar that used to be expected of all losing politicians in this country, and for a simple reason: When you live in a democracy, accepting your losses is what you have to do. Not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.</p><p>Especially when it’s hard. Al Gore and Hillary Clinton conceded in the wake of their own agonizing losses in 2000 and 2016, even though they both won more votes than their opponents.</p><p>And yet somehow Trump gets a pass from this most basic requirement — not simply for refusing to acknowledge his own defeat in 2020, but also for lying about a “stolen” election, violating the laws and the Constitution, and then inciting a violent insurrection at the Capitol in an effort to overturn it. Despite all this, a few minutes after noon on Jan. 20, 2025, the federal criminal prosecution of him for this abuse of trust (not to mention for stealing and hoarding quantities of highly classified documents) will vanish into thin air.</p><p>So forgive me if I scoff at the “Where is Kamala?” memes that circulated on Wednesday before she went on camera. No one in America is worse at accepting defeat than Trump and his followers. And that’s because under his tutelage, most of the Republican Party has come to believe that the only legitimate elections are the ones that it wins.</p><p>Contrast this with all the conspiracy theories you are not hearing right now about Trump’s vote totals. For example, we learned Wednesday that Nye County, Nev., a Trump-friendly rural county, <a href="https://x.com/RalstonReports/status/1854207159233602039" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">did not report</a> many thousands of votes in its initial tally. It’s a significant oversight, as those votes could end up costing Democrats a hotly contested Senate seat.</p><p>Now imagine the parties were reversed: Republicans would be raging about fraud, with neither evidence nor good faith — as Trump did Tuesday afternoon, claiming there was “massive CHEATING” in Philadelphia even before the polls closed. There was not, of course, nor was there any fraud in Nye County; minor mistakes happen all the time in elections involving hundreds of millions of people. Yet because it’s the Republican candidate who will likely benefit from this mistake, everyone is suddenly quiet.</p><p>This is the world we now live in: One party follows basic rules and norms of democratic politics and loses, and the other lies, cheats and tries to steal — and wins. It’s reverse accountability. And it can’t be sustained.</p><p>That is, it can’t be sustained in a democracy that prizes fairness and faithfulness to the law. In America, by contrast, it may be the way things are for the foreseeable future.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="23" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzlhN2MzNWU0LTQ3MDktNWFjNS1iYjE3LTEwMTU4NWNhMDQyMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#democrat-despair-trump-win" data-source-id="100000009811473"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-06T19:12:33.199Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 6, 2024, 2:12 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>I’m glad my grandchildren are too little to understand what happened on Tuesday. Like a lot of kids in liberal families, they’re probably wondering why all the grown-ups they know are walking around muttering darkly to themselves, wiping away furtive tears and forcing a smile while trying to comprehend their future in a country that seems so alien.</p><p>Eventually our family will have to discuss it. We will have to help the kids make their way through a world made more coarse and less tolerant by the re-election of Donald Trump. We can hope that the values expressed by a majority of voters in this election will not be the kids’ values, that when they come of age they will cast their vote thinking about the common good, instead of as an instrument of divisiveness, bigotry and narrow personal interests.</p><p>It will be up to their generation to somehow reconstruct a consensus of fundamental decency. And the only way they will be able to do that is if we grown-ups find a way to move past despair, defeatism and outright bewilderment to demonstrate that we haven’t given up on this country and its promise. Don’t let your kids hear you joke about moving to Canada; let them hear you talk about sticking around and finding a way to keep this disaster from happening again to the country they will inherit.</p><p>They are the ones who will have to live under the rulings of a Supreme Court and a judiciary that will probably curtail many of the freedoms that so many of us have come to take for granted. They’re the ones who will watch wide-eyed as immigrants and people of color are demonized by an ascendant white nationalist movement that now has an ally in the White House. They will see a government intended to promote the public welfare turned into a weapon against the administration’s enemies in the bureaucracy, the news media and the culture.</p><p>And it’s up to us to show them that it doesn’t have to be that way. We will have to acknowledge, in some humility, that this country has failed tens of millions of our children’s neighbors whose bitterness is so palpable that they will cling to false promises. To counter that, in small acts and large, we and our political leaders will have to demonstrate that possibilities for progress still remain.</p><p>When a judge rejects a draconian order to deport millions of families, we should celebrate that act and explain why we still need jurists with a conscience. When Ukraine and possibly other countries hold out desperately against an emboldened Vladimir Putin, we should cite them as examples of courage.</p><p>And for the next generation’s sake, we must rebuild an education system that has failed its students, leaving too many Americans ignorant of their civic culture and too susceptible to lies and manipulation.</p><p>Canada is full, anyway; let’s reassemble a United States that no one wants to escape.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FlODNhZDlhLTMwYzAtNTg0Zi1hZDJkLTAxNmQ4OGYxZDczZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#trump-voters-crude-laughter" data-source-id="100000009811482"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-l-friedman"><img alt="Thomas L.

Many Americans feel like strangers in their own homes, thanks to illegal immigration, rapidly evolving social norms and a job market increasingly unsympathetic to the less educated.</p><p>But the thing I don’t understand, and will never understand, and will forever be appalled by, is the laughing.</p><p>Every time I watched a clip where Trump was riffing to the crowd about Liz Cheney or “fake news” reporters being shot, or telling people that Kamala Harris is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/trump-vulgarity-pennsylvania-rally.html" title="">a shit vice president,</a>” or when he approved of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/trump-insult-worked-corner-rally-harris/" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/trump-insult-worked-corner-rally-harris/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">audience members</a> who referred to Harris as a “ho,” you saw crowds of people surrounding him who were laughing uproariously at his crude and violent language.</p><p>The implicit message was that the joke is on us, on the rest of us — liberals or conservatives — who still think you can succeed by adhering to norms and playing by the rules, who still think you can succeed as a politician by inspiring your followers and not by insulting your opponents.</p><p>My wife, Ann, who is from a small town in Iowa whose schoolteachers she credits to this day for pounding good fundamentals of English grammar into her, shared with me this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/11/19/donald-trump-insults-vulgarities-republicans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> article from Nov. 20, 2023, because it reflected an Iowa so unlike where she was raised that she couldn’t recognize the place:</p><blockquote><p>The next day, Trump swooped into Iowa for his own event — where he lobbed insults, made crude references and casually tossed out baseless and false claims designed to belittle his opponents and critics in vicious terms. Children wandered around in shirts and hats with the letters “FJB,” an abbreviation for an obscene jab at President Biden that other merchandise spelled out: “F— Biden.”</p></blockquote><p>The fact that Trump only seems to know how to win by denigrating others, and the fact that so many Americans knew this from his first time in office — and raucously welcomed the sequel — well, that bothers me. Because that kind of mind-set and behavior is what leads to a full-blown breakdown in norms, and when the norms go, no laws will protect you. That’s when I get scared. That’s when I feel we’ve passed through some normative membrane into a new and very dark room.</p><p>Trump could be so much more successful if he actually extended a hand to his opponents, showed them respect and shared credit. But the fact that his default option is always set on crudity or cruelty first — well, watch out.</p><p>Because he is going to discover that the problems we face as a country, from debt to competing with China to adapting to A.I. to absorbing extreme weather, are now so big and hard they can only be fixed together, not by him alone. And mocking half the country is not going to be a strategy for success.</p><p>In the end, without a change in his behavior, the joke won’t just be on the rest of us, but on his supporters as well.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNiYzlkY2JlLTg2YzItNTM5NC04ZGEwLTliYjlhMWIwOGEyZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#pandemic-mothers-trump-voters" data-source-id="100000009811377"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessica-grose"><img alt="Jessica Grose" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-06T16:22:49.110Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 6, 2024, 11:22 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Some of the angriest people I have ever interviewed were parents who lived in blue areas of the country in 2021 and 2022. I wonder if their lingering rage fueled Donald Trump’s decisive win on Tuesday.</p><p>Their schools were still closed, even after teachers had been vaccinated against Covid. Their preschoolers were still wearing masks, even though, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/10/opinion/masks-children.html" title="">as I wrote at the time</a>, there was compelling anecdotal evidence that masking was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/28/1075842341/growing-calls-to-take-masks-off-children-in-school" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creating social and emotional delays</a>. There was never any real explanation from public health authorities as to why children under 5 were masking in America, a practice that went against recommendations from the World Health Organization.</p><p>I remember these parents feeling both furious and politically adrift. They felt especially betrayed by the Democrats they had always voted for. Were they a pivotal part of the coalition that helped Trump win?</p><p>While early exit polls are almost always incomplete, I will be eager to see who pushed Trump over the edge in purple places like Bucks County, Pa., where parents sued the Pennsbury School District for <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/school-boards-mask-requirement-lawsuit/#:~:text=The%20parents%20also%20sued%20Pennsbury,mental%20health%20and%20academic%20success" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continuing mask mandates after the state had lifted the requirement</a>.</p><p>Kamala Harris and Democrats in general were the institutional candidates this cycle. If you were angry at any institution for any reason, Trump offered a more compelling argument. Some moderates would say that during the pandemic, <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/labor-teachers-union-ceasefire-gaza-israel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teachers’ unions</a> and school boards were mucking around far outside their scope while a true educational crisis was unfolding.</p><p>I spent a long evening earlier this year hearing from Michigan parents, who <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/01/17/ann-arbor-school-district-to-consider-tonight-measure-on-suspension-of-mid-east-fighting/72203112007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were livid that the school board in Ann Arbor</a> was embroiled in an argument about passing a resolution calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and Israel rather <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/opinion/covid-education-crisis-election.html" title="">than addressing chronic absenteeism</a> or falling test scores.</p><p>Trump’s K-12 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/30/opinion/thepoint#trump-education-plan" title="">education plan is totally nonsensical</a> and it involves <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/da7f3c42-76b5-42c0-9beb-475d649030ae#:~:text=Here%20is%20my%20plan%20to,to%20allow%20it%20to%20happen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the direct election of principals by parents</a>, though there is no mechanism to make that happen.

Democrats have executed an exhaustive field operation in Michigan and other battleground states. Voters in Michigan have sometimes received up to a dozen text messages and phone calls a day reminding them to vote, some including a photograph of their polling sites.</p><p>We’ll know soon whether it was enough. But if Harris wins, these field operations may be the reason.</p><p>By Election Day though, many likely voters had already cast ballots, and some volunteers were met by residents who said they didn’t plan to vote at all.</p><p>“I don’t like this male-versus-female thing,” Herbert Miles, a 36 year-old Black man, told canvassers at his door in Detroit, explaining his decision not to vote. Behind him, his three small children pressed their faces against the window and smiled and waved at the canvassers. “I have two daughters and prefer Kamala,” he said. But then he added, “We don’t need a woman president to inspire them.” Miles said he hadn’t voted in 2020 either.</p><p>The threat to democracy isn’t only Trumpism, but also disaffection among wary voters in complicated times. Listening to these voters drives home in real time the vital importance of Black women to the Democratic coalition, and, increasingly, college-educated voters of all backgrounds.</p><p>When I asked Emma Mitchell, a 73-year-old Black woman from Detroit, why she was volunteering for Harris, Mitchell told a story about growing up in the Jim Crow South. Mitchell, who was raised in Louisiana, recalled an incident during a trip to Mississippi when she and her siblings were subjected to racial slurs and attacked when they tried to visit a burger shop. “We couldn’t even get a doughnut unless we knew a white person,” she said. Mitchell said she believed Trump wants to ban abortion in part because he is concerned about the decrease in the white birthrate.</p><p>In Ann Arbor, students at the University of Michigan said they understood the added weight of their vote in an election that was too close to call. Droves of students walked through campus wearing “I voted” stickers. But the campus was unusually quiet. Many students I spoke to said they were filled with anxiety about the possibility of Donald Trump returning to office.</p><p>“We were in fifth grade when he was elected,” Allison Jackson, a 19-year-old freshman from Dallas, said of Trump. Jackson told me that she remembered that time as “very dark.” She voted for Harris, as did most students I spoke with here.</p><p>Several students here said they had considered voting for Jill Stein because they were angry about American support for Israel’s war in Gaza. But all said that after doing their research, they had ultimately chosen to vote for Harris instead, in many cases because of women’s rights.</p><p>“I decided, we just need to get Trump out of the way, then we can deal with the rest of it,” Zoe Vorwald, 18, told me.</p><p>If Harris wins, it will be because of voters like these.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="17" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzVlNTM2N2UzLWZiOTYtNWI3NS04ZjVhLThlYzFmZGI5YzcwNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#gallant-fired-israel-netanyahu" data-source-id="100000009808969"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/serge-schmemann"><img alt="Serge Schmemann" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-05T21:38:55.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 5, 2024, 4:38 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The protests in Israel began almost as soon as the word came down on Tuesday that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-fires-gallant.html" title="">Benjamin Netanyahu had fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant</a>. Crowds began to gather near the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Beersheba and other towns to protest the firing.</p><p>The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said it was an “act of madness” to sack the defense minister in the midst of a regional conflict against Hamas, Hezbollah and their Iranian patron and called on “all Zionist patriots” to take to the streets.</p><p>Netanyahu no doubt anticipated the reaction. The last time he fired Gallant, in March 2023, after the defense minister had publicly criticized Netanyahu’s legislative efforts to subvert the independence of the judiciary, huge street protests compelled the prime minister to rescind his order.</p><p>The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and the massive Israeli assault in Gaza that followed temporarily pushed the personal animosity of Netanyahu and Gallant into the background. But the defense minister’s disagreements with Netanyahu over the conduct of the war, as well as on other issues — including the drafting of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the army (which Gallant supported) — became increasingly evident and rancorous.</p><p>Especially galling for Netanyahu was that the Biden administration, fed up with the prime minister’s refusal to heed Washington’s calls for restraint in Gaza, turned instead to dealing with Gallant. The Israeli public, too, having grown tired of Netanyahu’s machinations to stay in office at any cost to avoid prosecution on corruption charges, began viewing Gallant as the antithesis of Netanyahu and his ultranationalist allies.</p><p>Gallant was the no-nonsense politician who spoke out against the judicial changes; the defense minister who insisted on the priority of bringing home the hostages over an all-out, murderous campaign; the former commando who contradicted the ultranationalist hawks with the argument that “not every goal can be achieved by military action alone.”</p><p>The breaking point was apparently a letter Gallant sent last week to the government arguing that “the war is being conducted without a compass” and proposing new war goals for Gaza, Lebanon, Iran and the West Bank. This direct challenge to Netanyahu and his far-right allies drew an icy response from the prime minister, who said he found the letter “quite puzzling.” In a video posted on his X account, Netanyahu said he had fired Gallant because of a breakdown in trust and “significant differences in managing Israel’s war.”</p><p>Less puzzling was the timing of the firing: Election Day in the United States. Netanyahu no doubt counted on political fever in the United States to drown out any reaction from the Biden administration or critics of Israel’s brutality in Gaza. Israelis are also closely watching the election, the outcome of which will strongly affect their relations with America, and thus might be slow to once again take to the streets against Netanyahu.</p><p>Gallant, for his part, had only a brief, one-sentence, response, posted on X: “The security of the state of Israel is and always will be my life’s mission.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2UzODM5OWQ2LWViM2UtNTFhYi1hMjg5LTljMzlmYWUxYTlkOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#fulton-georgia-bomb-threats" data-source-id="100000009808636"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charles-m-blow"><img alt="Charles M.

South Fulton bills itself as the “Blackest city in America.”</p><p>He said at that point, around noon, there had been seven bomb threats around the county, they had all been deemed “noncredible,” and none of them had resulted in a polling location being closed for more than 30 minutes. Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, said the source of the phony threats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/pollls-voting-bomb-threats.html" title="">was in Russia</a>.</p><p>About an hour later, the mayor texted:</p><p>“Just got word of another threat at SW Arts Ctr.” The Southwest Arts Center is where the City Council meets. He texted that the police and fire departments were on the scene.</p><p>When I asked Kamau, who is changing to the one-word name Kobi, what he made of the bomb threats, he said, “I think that there’s folks that are scared about people voting.” He continued, speaking specifically about the citizens of South Fulton:</p><p>“We’re the sons and daughters of people who have faced down lynch mobs, water cannons and canines to vote. So this isn’t going to turn us around.”</p><p>Even if there are no bombs — and we must all hope that these threats continue to ring hollow — the objective of the threats can still be achieved: the interruption of voting and an ambient danger associated with the casting of ballots.</p><p>It is impossible to know if these threats will have any measurable effect on voter turnout, but the tactic is one that many Black people remember in their bones. It represents the opponent of their enfranchisement using every available tactic to deter them from voting.</p><p>And in cases like this, you must ask yourself two questions:</p><p>If you believe your vote doesn’t matter, why would people go to such extreme lengths to keep you from casting it?</p><p>And who would benefit if people in this largely Black county had a lower turnout?</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzVmMWYwMmI1LWIyYzAtNWI4Yy1iZTJjLWMyZjJmMTMzMmM2Zg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#steelworker-indiana-vote" data-source-id="100000009807923"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-05T19:30:26.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 5, 2024, 2:30 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Like everyone else on the planet, I’ve been wondering who will win this neck-and-neck nail-biter of an election. So I called up Shannon Mulcahy to ask how she’s voting.</p><p>Mulcahy, who lives in Whitestown, Ind., and lost her job as a steelworker when her plant moved to Mexico in 2017, became my personal bellwether on the American mood when I wrote <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/591675/american-made-by-farah-stockman/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a book about her factory closing</a> and what became of all the workers in the years that followed.</p><p>I noticed during my research for that book that whenever she shrugged off some outrage like the Stormy Daniels affair, Donald Trump weathered the storm. Whenever she got angry about something Trump had done, like the child separation policy at the border, he was forced to change course. That’s because Mulcahy’s people are Trump people, the very essence of his base.</p><p>Mulcahy loved Trump in 2016 because he promised to renegotiate NAFTA, which she blamed for the loss of her job. By 2020, she had soured on him because of his behavior during the pandemic. She ended up protesting Trump at rallies and cast her ballot for Joe Biden. (It wasn’t her first time voting for a Democrat: She supported Barack Obama in 2008.)</p><p>So how is she feeling now?</p><p>Two weeks ago, she told me that she was torn about how to vote, much like the country itself. On the one hand, she likes Kamala Harris. “She’s tough,” she told me, after watching the debate. Mulcahy, a blue-collar feminist who had to fight for every opportunity she got in her male-dominated factory, believes in a woman’s right to choose and likes the idea of a female president. She doesn’t like what took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6.</p><p>On the other hand, she lost four close relatives, including a young niece, to fentanyl overdoses over these past four years. Fox News, and Trump, blamed the situation at the Mexican border for such deaths. And now groceries have become unaffordable. A family-size bag of Doritos now costs $8, she told me.</p><p>“I just feel like things were better when Republicans were in,” she said. As for Harris, Mulcahy said, “I feel like she’s had her chance,” adding: “She’s been in there four years. What’s going to be different this time?”</p><p>On Election Day, she answered my call just as she left her polling place.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be unhappy if Kamala won,” she told me. “But I just voted Republican, all the way.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzI1YjAyNGZiLTdiMTYtNTk1Ny1iNDliLWI3MzQ3MDJkNzk3MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#megyn-kelly-trump-rally" data-source-id="100000009805960"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessica-bennett"><img alt="Jessica Bennett" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/04/opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion/jessica-bennett-opinion-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-05T16:15:35.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 5, 2024, 11:15 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>There wasn’t “blood coming out of her wherever.” In fact, there wasn’t even bad blood between Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News anchor, as she campaigned for her onetime nemesis in Pittsburgh on Monday.</p><p>Kelly moderated the first Republican primary debate nine years ago and questioned Trump on a subject that a substantial portion of America now seems to care very little about: his treatment of women.</p><p>“You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,” Kelly began in the debate’s first question, before Trump interrupted her and lashed out. He later <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/629553612839124992" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> her a “bimbo” and “nasty,” and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/you-have-to-treat-em-like-shit-before-megyn-kelly-trump-dumped-wine-on-a-female-reporter/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seemed to suggest</a> she was on her period.</p><p>So it was darkly amusing — albeit not exactly unpredictable — when Kelly greeted Trump this week with a kiss on the cheek. She smooched a man who continues to denigrate women in public statements, who has been found liable for sexual assault and who, tellingly, mocked Kelly as recently as <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-shivs-megyn-kelly-for-making-a-career-by-pretending-she-likes-me/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March</a>, saying “she’s sort of making a career by pretending she likes me.”</p><p>Even so, as “a strong, intelligent woman” (as Kelly referred to herself onstage), she was there to argue that Trump is in fact a “protector of women.”</p><p>(Seriously, though, is anyone actually buying this?)</p><p>Kelly’s invitation came, she said, after she <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/megyn-kelly-savages-trumps-bro-tastic-madison-square-garden-rally/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> on her podcast that she worried the Trump campaign needed to “clean up the bro-talk” to not further alienate female voters, after a rally at Madison Square Garden that featured a comedian who made a racist joke, a retired <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hulk-hogan-spitting-gesture-prompts-speculation-he-was-making-crass-hawk-tuah-reference-to-kamala-harris/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WWE wrestler</a> (who spit when Kamala Harris’s name was mentioned) and a sanitation worker who called Harris the Antichrist.</p><p>“Do they have no women advising their campaign?” Kelly asked.</p><p>But the way Kelly chose to appeal to women when given the chance was by … talking about men. “He will close the border, he will keep the boys out of girls’ sports — and you know what else, he will look out for our boys too. Our forgotten boys and our forgotten men.”</p><p>She went on: “What I don’t want, and what I don’t think you want, is the left’s version of ‘masculinity.’ I’m not into their version of ‘toxic masculinity’ or ‘new masculinity.’ I prefer the old version.”</p><p>Interestingly, the old version is precisely what is on offer: Trump and his stooges are already dragging us backward, with misogynist rhetoric and anti-woman policy proposals. Did anyone really need Megyn Kelly to tell them that?</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I4MWQ3NjAxLWI3ZjctNTU4MC04MmI0LWU5ODY3ZmU2Nzg0Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#the-shady-gimmick-behind-elon-musks-million-dollar-game" data-source-id="100000009803355"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-05T01:41:55.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 4, 2024, 8:41 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>This article has been updated to reflect the judge’s ruling in the case.</em></p><p>Of all the things that Elon Musk has done to get Donald Trump elected — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/elon-musk-x-posts.html" title="">magnifying misinformation</a> on his social media platform, X; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/style/elon-musk-donald-trump-campaign-rally.html" title="">jumping up and down</a> onstage at rallies; and pouring eye-popping sums into pro-Trump propaganda — nothing has generated more excitement than his strange and dubious contest.</p><p>Musk announced recently that he would “randomly” award $1 million every day until the election to people in swing states who registered to vote and signed his super PAC’s petition. More than a million people have signed the petition, the PAC has claimed on social media. In court, lawyers said some 18,000 of them were owed some sort of payment for referring others to the petition, and that 17 people from across the country would receive $1 million.</p><p>It’s very on brand for allies of Trump, a reality TV star, to turn our elections into a game show. In a way, you have to admire the chutzpah. While Kamala Harris’s campaign is focused on getting out the vote through a massive door-knocking campaign fueled by volunteers, the Trump campaign had the world’s richest man handing out million-dollar checks to winners of the Trump rally lottery.</p><p>Except that on Monday in a Philadelphia court, his lawyers had to defend the giveaway against <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XITnYU90Qv8VatBq8WL0_qaDd0vsBmVu/view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a charge brought by the local district attorney</a> that it violated state consumer protection laws and constituted an illegal lottery. Musk’s lawyers were forced to describe the “winners” not as people who “won” money but as ones who “earned” money for performing a service. They weren’t randomly chosen at all, the lawyers said, but selected for their unique abilities to boost the campaign. Monday’s winner will be from Arizona, and Tuesday’s will be from Michigan. So, no, not random at all.</p><p>“We ask people to sign a petition and refer others to sign a petition. There are payments made in exchange for that,” Chris Gober, a Republican Party lawyer, explained. “We then take that pool of individuals across the country and determine which ones of those individuals would serve as effective spokesperson” for the America PAC, a super PAC that lists Gober as treasurer.</p><p>As a defense against accusations of running an illegal lottery, it worked. The judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/elon-musk-america-pac-sweepstakes-ruling.html" title="">declined to stop the giveaway</a>. But as a defense against accusations of grift and dishonesty, it was essentially an admission.</p><p>“Our case got better this morning,” Larry Krasner, Philadelphia’s district attorney, said from the stand.</p><p>It was a rare moment when the public gets to peer behind the curtain of a Trump P.R. stunt, which turned lucky winners into paid actors and transformed earnest voters signing a petition to support the Constitution into people looking for a check in the mail. (Musk’s lawyers said that anyone who signed the petition and persuaded others to sign would <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-trump-47-petition-payment-voters-1235141313/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">get paid $47</a> in addition to the chance of “earning” a million.)</p><p>Is it illegal? Maybe not. But it is disturbing. An oligarch is playing games with our democracy. It might turn out to be expensive to issue all those checks. But for the rest of us, it’s a cheap trick.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzhlMmZjNGE5LTJmNmItNTVkYS1iZTFjLWQ1Zjg4MTI5MmQ0OA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#quincy-jones-music" data-source-id="100000009803131"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brent-staples"><img alt="Brent Staples" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-04T20:40:18.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 4, 2024, 3:40 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Quincy Jones in 1959.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bob Parent/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Working variously as a writer, producer, conductor and arranger for more than half a century, Quincy Jones — who died on Sunday in Los Angeles at the age of 91 — brought a jazzy originality and sophistication to recordings across genres.</p><p>One way to grasp his extraordinary range is to listen consecutively to three disparate recordings that bear his stamp. The first is “Sinatra at the Sands,” which finds the singer at his earthiest and most relaxed, backed by Count Basie and his orchestra. The second is Michael Jackson’s iconic “Thriller,” the ’80s juggernaut that set a high bar for moneymaking and pop music freshness.</p><p>The third is “We Are the World,” performed by a super chorus of more than 40 artists — including Jackson, Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder — to raise money for famine relief.</p><p>As a young man in the 1950s, Jones studied with the renowned French composer and composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, whose students included Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and Philip Glass. Boulanger, he said, volunteered the best advice he would ever receive, telling him: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrnywDs1BMw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Your music will never be more or less than you are a human being. So I started to work on the human being</a>.”</p><p>He was already music royalty by the time he joined forces with Michael Jackson for the 1979 album “Off the Wall” and the collaboration that would transform pop music. But what started out as a fruitful and respectful collaboration ended in acrimony.</p><p>Jones sued <a href="https://apnews.com/article/7adb910007e4d705278bed1b7ecb5660" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jackson’s estate in 2013</a>, asserting that the King of Pop had cheated him of his rightful due. Later, during a now-famous interview in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/quincy-jones-in-conversation.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York magazine</a>, he described Jackson as a thief who had stolen music from others and declined to compensate them. “He was as Machiavellian as they come,” he said.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2NiZGZkNzQ1LTUwNjQtNTE3ZC04MmI0LTIyZTJjMWU4MTU4ZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#black-men-georgia-election" data-source-id="100000009802804"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charles-m-blow"><img alt="Charles M.

One would think that all Black people would have been rejoicing at the progress. Yet, a month after the Voting Rights Act became law, frustrated Black people in Watts rioted.</p><p>That’s an emotion that may explain why some Black voters, and particularly men, are not readily lining up behind Kamala Harris this year, according to one prominent Black mayor.</p><p>In the fall of 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote <a href="https://www.unz.com/PDF/PERIODICAL/SaturdayRev-1965nov13/33-35/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article</a> in the weekly magazine Saturday Review about how the civil rights movement had been “essentially regional, not national,” with Black people in the South reaping most of the benefits and creating in them a particular form of optimism.</p><p>On the other hand, King pointed out, the plight of Black people in the North — in education, housing, police brutality and employment — grew worse.</p><p>King described Black people in Northern ghettos as living in a “schizophrenic social milieu” as they watched a “role reversal” in which energy flowed South to help Black people there while “the North, heretofore vital, atrophied, and the traditionally passive South burst with dynamic vibrancy.” In King’s estimation, part of the riot’s energy came from a feeling of being left behind, a feeling of a sort of advancement envy.</p><p>That sense of being overlooked and outpaced is precisely what Khalid Kamau, mayor of South Fulton, in the battleground state of Georgia, described to me last week. South Fulton, which has roughly 111,000 people, of whom more than 90 percent are Black, bills itself as the “Blackest City in America.”</p><p>Last week I asked Kamau, who is changing to a one-word name, Kobi, what he was hearing from his constituents on the verge of the election.</p><p>He said that generally, among women and people over 50 there was definite excitement for Harris’s candidacy. But among those under 50 there was some noticeable indifference, in part because they had once before voted to elected a Black president, Barack Obama, only to decide that it didn’t make a material difference in their lives.</p><p>He says the sentiment is essentially that “we had a Black president before,” and “then fake cops in Florida, and real cops in Ferguson, like lynch our sons in front of his face.” He’s referring to the killings of Trayvon Martin in Florida and Michael Brown in Missouri.</p><p>He is particularly worried about young Black men. He says that these men have the sense that they are losing ground while other groups, including women and the L.G.B.T.Q. community, are moving up. As he put it, “they see these other constituency groups making advancements and the issues that are important to Black men just not even being in the conversation at all.”</p><p>As he put it: “There are definitely some Black men that feel like this election is all about Black women and white women. And like, you don’t need my vote.”</p><p>He says that some of these men may vote for Donald Trump, but he fears that more of them simply won’t vote at all.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg0MzdkYmRlLTRlMjktNTY1Zi04Y2I1LTBhNmEzMWViYTcxNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#tipsheet-voters-swing-states" data-source-id="100000009801625"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-04T10:04:15.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 4, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we start the week off with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><p>After Donald Trump won in 2016, his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, made a comment about voter behavior that stayed with me, and I think applies to the Trump-Harris race too. Conway said:</p><blockquote><p>I think one thing that was missed all along in this election is something we noticed early on, which is that there’s a difference to voters between what offends you and what affects you. And they were being told constantly, “stare at this; care about this; make this the deal-breaker once and for all.” And yet, they voted the way voters have always voted, on things that affect them, not just on things that offend them.</p></blockquote><p>I thought of her comment as I dug into Sunday’s final New York Times/Siena College polls of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" title="">the seven swing states</a>. Trump looks more competitive in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin than he did in 2020 and 2016 — three states that are critical for Kamala Harris. And we’ve found, in 61 focus groups by Times Opinion over the past three years, that voters in those three states and other battlegrounds have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/opinion/election-focus-groups.html" title="">complained much more</a> about inflation, grocery and gas prices, housing costs, interest rates, health care costs and other things that affect them financially than Trump’s offensive behavior and language.</p><p>In 2016, Democrats thought Trump’s “Access Hollywood” comments would sink him; today, they think voters will be offended by a Trump ally calling Puerto Rico “garbage” or Trump saying he will protect women “whether they like it or not.” But as Maureen Dowd <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/opinion/trump-madison-square-garden-private-life.html" title="">wrote</a> this weekend, this is pretty standard fare for Trump. Many undecided and late-breaking voters are casting ballots on what affects them — and Kamala Harris has never had a great argument on the economy. She has been vice president in an administration that many voters blame for their economic problems, and she has not successfully separated herself from President Biden.</p><p>But here’s the twist about Trump, Harris and what affects voters. Trump’s conduct shifted from offending people to affecting them during Covid, the aftermath of the 2020 election and on Jan. 6, 2021. He put our lives, our nation and our democracy in peril. His actions affected voters again when his conservative majority on the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Looking at Election Day, Republicans think voters will choose Trump again because of how the economy affects them. Some may — but not everyone. Will the nation really re-elect a guy who barely won in 2016, lost in 2020 and is widely unpopular now? I think the G.O.P. is underestimating how many voters feel Trump affected their lives since 2020 for the worse. On Tuesday, I’ll be watching four swing states especially closely: North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. I think we’re likely to get vote results and trending direction in those states earlier than in the other three battlegrounds. And if Harris shows strength in North Carolina, or Trump in Michigan, that will tell us a lot about how the night will go.</p><p>I’m also now keeping an eye on Iowa after J. Ann Selzer’s shock poll there this weekend showing Harris ahead and up by 20 percentage points with women. Count me among those who know Selzer as the best in the business — and that margin with women as evidence of movement away from Trump because of how he’s affected them. Joy may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/kamala-harris-democratic-convention.html" title="">not be a strategy</a>, but neither is taking away people’s rights and their place in a democracy.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2E0MjM3MDJmLWU3OGItNTI4YS05ODU0LTQ1NThmY2JmYjM5NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#georgia-harris-competitive-polls" data-source-id="100000009801468"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay"><img alt="Mara Gay" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-03T22:31:17.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 3, 2024, 5:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The 11th-hour <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" title="">New York Times/Siena poll</a> on Sunday showing Kamala Harris ahead of Donald Trump in Georgia by a single percentage point is no fluke.</p><p>Many political insiders put Georgia into the Trump column months ago. When I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/opinion/georgia-harris-trump-election.html" title="">crisscrossed the state last week</a>, though, it was clear that voters there had not given up.</p><p>Atlantans had festooned homes and businesses with “The South for Harris” signs and posters of John Lewis. “Freedom is not a state. It is an act,” one poster read, quoting Lewis, the civil rights leader and congressman who died in 2020.</p><p>Lifelong conservatives were showing up at Republicans for Harris events, where they told me they loved American democracy enough to vote for a Democrat.</p><p>“What he did on Jan. 6 is unforgivable,” Hilda Bishop, a white woman from Duluth, Ga., told me of Trump at one such event. She said she voted for Trump in 2016 but not in 2020 and would not do so again. She said his handling of the pandemic and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/whitmer-blasts-trump-s-appalling-response-her-after-feds-foil-n1243535" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his response to the foiled kidnapping plot against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</a> of Michigan had repulsed her as well.</p><p>Across Georgia, Black voters wore shirts with political slogans like “Voting is my Black job.” All year, polls have suggested Trump is gaining ground with racial minorities. But a vast majority of Black voters will almost certainly vote Democratic. In Georgia they are turning out in large numbers.</p><p>Democratic strategists said this weekend that Black voters accounted for 27 percent of the early vote in Georgia, which ended Friday. That matches turnout in 2020, when the state went for Biden by 11,779 votes, fueled largely by these voters.</p><p>On the campus of Morehouse College, a prominent historically Black institution in Atlanta, Ajani Bond, a 19-year-old sophomore, told me he didn’t know anybody who planned to vote for Trump.</p><p>“He’s a fascist. A racist. Then there’s the sexual assault cases, even how he treated his dead wife,” Bond told me. “He’s inciting white men who think they can do whatever they want.” Bond said he and his father, a U.S. Capitol Police officer, watched the Jan. 6 attack together on cable news, horrified. “Seeing my father’s face, I’ll never forget it,” Bond told me.</p><p>The South’s growing pro-democracy coalition of Black, Asian, Hispanic and now white college-educated voters is being underestimated.</p><p>Watching those voters at work these past days gave me faith as nothing else has that the project of democracy will continue, no matter the outcome of Tuesday’s election.</p><p>Nowhere did I see the ferocity and power of this commitment more strongly than in South Georgia, where Black and some white Democrats live alongside cotton fields and Trump signs. They are greatly outnumbered but play a critical role in statewide Democratic victories by shaving down Republican margins in these rural areas.</p><p>As they prepared to knock on doors last week in Albany, a small city in South Georgia, a small group of Americans, Black and white, exchanged hugs and prayed.</p><p>“We’re the heart of the old Confederacy and the cradle of the civil rights movement,” Jon Ossoff, a Democrat and the state’s first Jewish U.S. senator, told me at the event. “In the South, it is within living memory that decisions made by elected officials have had such a transformative impact on daily life, on whether schools are integrated, on, for goodness sakes, whether people are even allowed to vote.”</p><p>While many across the country wring their hands, these Americans have been hard at work. The balm for these perilous times may be to join them.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzgzMDZlYmQzLTQ4YmQtNWJlMS1hYzRmLTc1ZmQxODVlNjM4ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#pennsylvania-secret-harris-supporters" data-source-id="100000009801308"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-03T20:29:07.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 3, 2024, 3:29 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In 2016 many of Donald Trump’s supporters were so embarrassed to admit to pollsters that they were going to vote for him that his victory came as a shock. This time around, I bet that it will be the secret Kamala Harris supporters who make all the difference.</p><p>At the bustling Harris-Walz campaign headquarters in Wayne, Pa., an affluent purple community about half an hour’s drive north of Philadelphia, canvassers are advised to skip houses on their list if there is a Trump sign in the yard, to avoid outing closet Democrats to their family members. This unofficial protocol was adopted after canvassers witnessed tense moments at doorways, between husbands and wives when canvassers revealed who they were looking for and why, according to Alexandra Moncure, a volunteer who serves as events manager at that campaign field office.</p><p>“We’re trying to be delicate,” Moncure, who was a registered Republican until the Jan. 6 riot, told me.</p><p>On Sunday morning about 70 canvassers got fired up at that office with a visit from former Secretary of State John Kerry and Jim Greenwood, a Never Trump Republican from Bucks County who served in Congress from 1993 to 2005.</p><p>Greenwood, a co-chair of Pennsylvania Republicans for Harris, told the crowd that he speaks often to fellow conservatives who don’t want to vote for Trump but can’t bring themselves to cast a ballot for Harris. He tells them that Harris wouldn’t pursue a left-wing agenda and that even if she did, Republicans on Capitol Hill would stop her. Trump, on the other hand, would have no constraints.</p><p>But he went on to make a positive case for Harris, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/politics/republicans-harris-pennsylvania.html" title="">held a rally with Republican elected officials</a> in Bucks County two weeks ago.</p><p>“She’s a good person. She’s authentic. I love her,” he told the crowd. “Right in front of my wife, I said to her, ‘I’m smitten.’” (It wasn’t a problem because his wife “is smitten, too,” he told me.)</p><p>In the audience, Matthew McCaffery, a Marine Corps veteran who once served as a Republican City Council member in New Port Richey, Fla., wore a black T-shirt that read, “Republicans for Harris.”</p><p>“I’m one of the 10 percent,” he told me, referring to his prediction that 10 percent of Pennsylvania Republicans will cast ballots for Harris. He said he came up with that figure because of conversations he has had with some of his female friends and neighbors who tended to avoid talking about politics but who have recently begun to signal that they agree with him, he said.</p><p>“They’re eating the pets!” one of his neighbors joked to him, in what he described as a sign that she understood the absurdity of Trump’s claim that Haitians in Ohio were feasting on dogs and cats. And there may be many others: More than 150,000 Republicans cast protest votes for <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nikki-haley/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikki Haley</a> in the Pennsylvania primary, even though she had already dropped out of the race.</p><p>Secret Harris Republicans are elusive by definition. But given the number of loud and proud Harris Republicans frequenting that campaign office, I know the quiet supporters are out there.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2IyNGM1MTNhLTM2NGMtNWY1OS1hZDI5LTU5M2Q0NWY4YzFiNg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#dowd-harris-snl-rudolph" data-source-id="100000009801145"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maureen-dowd"><img alt="Maureen Dowd" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-03T18:35:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 3, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Electricity shot through the political press corps on Saturday night when we heard that Kamala Harris had diverted her plane to New York.</p><p>Reporters scrambled to pin down the story: On this last weekend before the election, that most guarded of politicians decided to take a risk and swing by 30 Rock for a surprise through-the-looking-glass appearance with her “Saturday Night Live” doppelgänger, Maya Rudolph.</p><p>In a cultural and mass media landscape that has been so delineated and fractured and polarized, where people are in their own little bubbles, “S.N.L.” is one of the last venues that speaks to the culture at large when it satirizes politicians.</p><p>So I was riveted, wondering if Rudolph and Harris would do their sketch face-to-face.</p><p>When I was reporting a <a href="https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2009/1/what-tina-wants" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vanity Fair cover story</a> on Tina Fey in October 2008, she was creating a sensation with her Sarah Palin impression. The key to mimicking Palin, Fey told me, was to talk as if she were “lost in a corn maze.”</p><p>In that wild political season, Palin agreed to come on the late-night show, as did her running mate, John McCain, creating skits that astounded even Lorne Michaels and the “S.N.L.” cast.</p><p>But Fey and Palin merely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0vVKZL-Z7I" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">walked past each other in identical suits in their sketch</a>.</p><p>I thought it was a lost opportunity, but Fey was adamant that she didn’t want to do what the legendary “S.N.L.” writer Jim Downey called a “classic sneaker-upper” with Palin. In the end, Palin offered her daughter Bristol as a babysitter for Fey’s 3-year-old daughter, and Fey got her husband’s parents and sister tickets to a Palin rally.</p><p>“I just didn’t want to have to do the impression at the same time with her,” Fey told me. “One, it would shine a light on the inaccuracies of the impression, and two, it’s just always — the only word I can think of is ‘sweaty.’”</p><p>Donald Trump had clowned around with two of his “S.N.L.” impersonators, Darrell Hammond and Taran Killam, during his monologue when he hosted the show in 2015 (a night that left many cast members torn about whether they were helping Trump). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL2dGTDQXVo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders once came on to do a skit</a> with his hilarious double, Larry David, and Hillary Clinton did a deft turn as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10153653357941303" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a bartender named Val</a> mocking Trump with her adoring double, Kate McKinnon.</p><p>After last night’s show, some viewers pointed out that Trump did a similar through-the-dressing-room-mirror skit with Jimmy Fallon in 2015. And Hillary had a similar line about whether her laugh was annoying in a cameo with Amy Poehler. Whatever. This is comedy on the fly.</p><p>Though conservatives never believe it, Lorne Michaels is going for the comedy, not trying to sway the election or hew to liberal values. He thought that Will Ferrell’s fumbling but affectionate impersonation of George W. Bush in 2000 made Bush more lovable and helped sway the election — even though it didn’t jibe with the politics of Ferrell and the rest of the “S.N.L.” cast. But if it helped W., so be it, Michaels said.</p><p>Kamala has privately worried about her laugh and was once so nervous at the prospect of having to dine with Washington journalists that she held a pre-dinner rehearsal with her staff pretending to be the journalists. (I can attest that dinner parties with Washington reporters are kind of hellish!)</p><p>Given that caution, she seemed nervy just for showing up to do a high-wire comedy routine live on the cusp of the election. The candidate and the comedian wore identical black suits, necklaces, earrings and flag pins.</p><p>Self-deprecation always works, and the radiant Kamala came across as appealing. She genuinely seemed to be having fun — a good avatar for her campaign of joy.</p><p>It felt like the popular Rudolph was giving the vice president a girl-power comedy benediction. “Take my palm-ala,” she told Kamala. “Kick back in our pajama-las and watch a rom-com-ala.”</p><p>And finally, Rudolph sent her off with some good advice for the nerve-racking, nail-biting, white-knuckling, goose-bumping 48 hours to come: “Keep calm-ala and carry on-ala.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2IyMTI3Y2MyLTcxY2MtNWQ4ZS1iZmJhLWI4MGZkMjYzODgzOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/07/opinion/thepoint#election-night-concerns" data-source-id="100000009799169"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-11-01T22:00:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Nov. 1, 2024, 6:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>As Election Day approaches, I’ve been having trouble sleeping.

We have already seen cases of officials refusing to certify vote totals and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michigan-county-refuses-to-certify-vote-growing-election-threat/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taking matters into their own hands</a> because they don’t like the outcome.</p><p>The good news is that there are many buffers in place, more than in 2020. First, the decentralized nature of American elections means that no one person’s actions can spread beyond a certain area.</p><p>Second, all states, including swing states, have legally binding deadlines for certification of their vote tallies, most in late November. Meeting these deadlines is not a choice; it is a requirement.</p><p>Third, Congress in 2022 passed the Electoral Count Reform Act, which, among other things, sets expedited procedures for federal courts to hear election disputes, including cases in which a local official somewhere refuses to certify a vote count.</p><p>I’m not including all the poll workers and election officials who have left or been pushed out of their jobs since 2020, in part because of harassment or threats of violence. That brings me to:</p><p><strong>What Does Concern Me: Violence</strong></p><p>The history of American elections <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/14/our-long-forgotten-history-of-election-related-violence" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is replete</a> with threats, intimidation and violence by those who apparently lacked the confidence that they could win through voting and majority rule. In recent decades, the most glaring examples of such behavior have come from Republicans.</p><p>There was the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/11/15/its-insanity-how-brooks-brothers-riot-killed-recount-miami/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brooks Brothers riot</a> in 2000 that helped shut down the recount in the Miami-Dade area, the precursor to George W. Bush’s victory; the caravan of Trump supporters who aggressively surrounded a Biden campaign bus on a Texas highway; armed militia members standing near ballot drop boxes; and, of course, the attack on the U.S. Capitol that Donald Trump incited on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn the election and install himself as president against the will of the people.</p><p>This year the threats are pouring in, putting decent Americans in fear for their lives and undermining the basic functioning of civil society. And thanks to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-america-pac-election-denial-community-x/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass disinformation peddlers</a> like Elon Musk, the threats and lies are being amplified and disseminated like never before.

The whole point of electoral politics is to resolve our differences peacefully and to accept our losses as well as our wins, knowing that there will soon be a chance to try again.</p><p>But when one party removes itself from that agreement and refuses to acknowledge defeat, bad things will inevitably happen.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
