    <h1>Supreme Court Turns Down Biden’s Appeal in Texas Abortion Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a dissent in the Idaho case, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. rued the development.</p><p>“Apparently,” he wrote, “the court has simply lost the will to decide the easy but emotional and highly politicized question that the case presents. That is regrettable.”</p><p>In the new case, Elizabeth B. Prelogar, the U.S. solicitor general, had <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1076/306458/20240401194129296_Becerra%20v.%20Texas%20final.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged the justices to decide</a> whether the federal law displaced the Texas abortion law “in the narrow but important circumstance where terminating a pregnancy is required to stabilize an emergency medical condition that would otherwise threaten serious harm to the pregnant woman’s health, but the state prohibits an emergency room physician from providing that care.”</p><p>Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1076/323066/20240821141651606_23-1076_Brief%20in%20Opposition.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the justices</a> that there was no conflict between his state’s law and the federal one.</p><p>In June, the justices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/supreme-court-idaho-abortion.html" title="">sidestepped ruling</a> on a similar clash between the federal law and Idaho’s abortion ban, dismissing an appeal in that case as improvidently granted. The ruling in the Idaho case left in place a lower court’s decision requiring emergency care there.</p><p>The court may yet return to the questions presented in the two cases, perhaps after the Ninth Circuit rules in the Idaho case.</p></div></div>
