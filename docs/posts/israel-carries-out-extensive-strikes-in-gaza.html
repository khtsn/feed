It has accused Israel of repeatedly violating the truce agreement by continuing military operations.</p><p>Israel and Hamas are supposed to be negotiating the next steps in the cease-fire agreement, which would involve a permanent end to the war that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. But mediators including the United States, Qatar and Egypt have made little headway, given the entrenched disagreements between the two sides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
