We are discussing this topic. It’s important that we raise these issues.”</p><p>His remarks came at a meeting of European leaders at a one-day summit to discuss several issues, including Europe’s relationship with the United States and the need for stability in Syria. The question of how European countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/europe/nato-ukraine-trump-peace-talks.html" title="">could step up support for Ukraine in Russia’s war</a> dominated the discussions.</p><p>That war has increasingly been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/world/europe/russia-kirillov-ukraine-general.html" title="">taking a precarious turn</a>. Ukrainian forces have been steadily losing ground and Russian troops, aided by fighters from North Korea, are advancing with better equipment and in bigger numbers. With President-elect Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/trump-congress-ukraine-aid.html" title="">potentially poised to cut back</a> U.S. assistance to Ukraine once he takes office in a month, European leaders have said they urgently need to deliver more air-defense systems and weapons to Ukraine.</p><p>On Wednesday night, Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, was host to Mr. Zelensky and several other European leaders, including from Germany, Italy and Denmark, at Mr. Rutte’s residence.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Zelensky spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France. He <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1869488618945094062" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> they discussed “the presence of forces in Ukraine that could contribute to stabilizing the path to peace.” </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The peacekeeper proposal has gained traction in recent days after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/trump-ukraine-russia-war-plan-8901d78b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump reportedly pushed for it</a> in a meeting in Paris with the Ukrainian leader and Mr. Macron two weeks ago. Since then, Mr. Zelensky’s repeated references to such a plan may be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/europe/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title="">an attempt to appeal to Mr. Trump</a>, who has called for a quick end to the war.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine with the president of the European Council, António Costa, in Brussels on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Geert Vanden Wijngaert/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Macron had previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/world/europe/europe-ukraine-support-meeting.html" title="">floated the idea of European troops in Ukraine in February</a>, possibly to train Ukrainian soldiers. Mr. Zelensky said earlier this month that Mr. Macron had revived the idea recently, suggesting that Western troops could be present on Ukrainian territory to guarantee a cease-fire while Ukraine is not a NATO member.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky suggested on Thursday a path to conflict resolution in which Ukraine would discuss sending peacekeepers with its European partners, while continuing to press allies, especially the U.S., to be allowed to join NATO. “These security guarantees can be discussed separately with the U.S. and Europe,” he said.</p><p>A few European countries, including <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-defense-minister-does-not-rule-out-eu-nato-troop-presence-in-ukraine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sweden</a> and <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/italy-open-to-peacekeeping-in-ukraine-minister/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Italy</a>, have not ruled out the option of deploying forces in Ukraine. But overall, many European capitals see it as a premature step while the war is still raging.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It is also unclear if European troops could ensure a cease-fire on their own in Ukraine, given Mr. Trump’s reluctance to directly involve the U.S. Army in any peace settlement.</p><p>Earlier, on Wednesday, Mr. Rutte suggested that it was too early to discuss a plan for peacekeepers and that the West’s focus should be on stepping up military support for Ukraine. The European Union’s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, also said on Thursday that the focus right now should be on how Europe could help strengthen Ukraine. “Any push for negotiations too soon will actually be a bad deal for Ukraine,” she said.</p><p>Still, some European leaders are acknowledging the pressure to end the war.</p><p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said on Thursday that the war in Ukraine had been going on for a “very, very long time now.” “We have to get into a situation in which peace becomes possible,” he said. “It must also be very clear that there must be no escalation of the war into a war between Russia and NATO.”</p><p>On Thursday, European leaders also discussed how to more urgently deliver air defense systems, ammunition and missiles, as well as more training and support for Ukrainian forces. Leaders also said that the first installment of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/business/g7-ukraine-loan-russian-assets.html" title="">$50 billion loan to Ukraine</a> from the Group of 7 nations would be dispersed in January, with a total of 18.1 billion euros ($18.8 billion) to be dispersed in 2025.</p><p>When asked about Mr. Trump’s push for a quick peace deal in Ukraine, Alexander de Croo, the prime minister of Belgium, said on Thursday that the priority was to push back the Russians. “First Ukraine has to win the war,” he <a href="https://x.com/alexanderdecroo/status/1869702410815349196" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>. “Once Ukraine has been able to push back the Russians then the EU will have to play its role to maintain peace and provide tangible security guarantees.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Zelensky Discusses Peacekeepers in Ukraine<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
