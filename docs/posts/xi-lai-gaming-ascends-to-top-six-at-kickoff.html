</span> in hopes of continuing their lower bracket run. JDG is now eliminated from the tournament, and will need to wait until Stage 1 to return to competition.</p>

<p>Due to XLG being a VCT newcomer, the teams have only played each other in the off-season. Despite coming from tier 2, XLG has bested JDG on all three occasions, twice with a 2-0. In the veto, JDG picked Pearl, Xi Lai&#39;s <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/13581/xi-lai-gaming/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-01-01&amp;date_end=" target="_blank">usual second ban</a>, while taking away Lotus, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/team/stats/13576/jdg-esports/?event_id=all&amp;core_id=all&amp;date_start=2025-01-01&amp;date_end=" target="_blank">their permaban this event</a>. XLG responded with their own permaban, Fracture, while picking Bind, a map which <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/433497/drg-and-nova-find-first-wins-at-china-kickoff" target="_blank">JDG lost to Dragon Ranger Gaming</a>. Haven remained as decider, which JDG has floated in the past and won in overtime against DRG in their opening series.</p>

<p>XLG took the first rounds of the series with a pistol win on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430855/jdg-esports-vs-xi-lai-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-lr2/?game=196717&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>. Xi Lai took an early lead, but a thrifty win and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/16924/stew">
		stew	</a>
</span>&#39;s heroics swung momentum back in JDG&#39;s favor. It was only until the final round of the half that XLG was able to answer back, as JDG guessed the wrong site in a 2v2 and allowed XLG to set up a Killjoy-Sova post-plant. </p>

<p>Unorthodox decision making from JDG gave their opponents the second pistol round, which allowed them to tie the scoreline at 7-7. <span data-ref-id="5">

</span> showed up to grant their team double digits and force XLG&#39;s second timeout. XLG was able to narrow the gap with a pair of rounds, but  JDG&#39;s lead was too large to overcome. JDG eventually won the map 13-9. stew ended the series with 28 eliminations and 11 first kills, half of the server&#39;s total.</p>

<p>Moving onto <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430855/jdg-esports-vs-xi-lai-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-lr2/?game=196718&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, Z1yan gave his team a close pistol win with a clutch and 3K. Not intent on being upstaged, <span data-ref-id="7">

</span> matched his teammate by helping win the next two rounds. stew returned to the series with a 1v1, but XLG proved superior for the rest of the half. jkuro won a Brimstone 1v1 to give JDG the fourth point of the map, sending the series to the break 8-4 with XLG in the lead.</p>

<p>Z1yan tried to replicate his pistol round success in the second half, but XLG clawed the round back to further extend the score gap. Xi Lai continued winning disadvantaged rounds, taking the bonus with a 3v2 which XLG won with two Classic kills against rifles. JDG Esports tried forcing to prevent match point and extend the series, but they barely did economic damage. Bind ended 13-4 in XLG&#39;s favor, sending the series to the decider map.</p>

<p>A fast C push and stew 3K gave JDG the opening pistol round on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430855/jdg-esports-vs-xi-lai-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-lr2/?game=196719&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Haven</a>. <span data-ref-id="11">

</span> matched it with his own Classic triple kill in the anti-eco, and a JDG post-plant fumble gave Xi Lai a 2-1 lead. XLG remained comfortable in their defense, and Rarga found various multikills to help his team confirm rounds. After Viva aced with the Operator, JDG showed off a well-executed round with Z1yan faking information and a cautious A take, ending the first half 9-3. </p>

</span> scores an ace to keep XLG in the lead</em></p>

<p>XLG reached 11 points with a comfortable pistol and anti-eco, but JDG reacted to prevent their opponents from reaching match point. Xi Lai remained patient, losing three rounds and a timeout but keeping their economy steady and building up an ultimate advantage. This let them run a set play on C, stalling long enough to turn Z1yan&#39;s triple kill inconsequential. A tactical pause from JDG had no effect, as Xi Lai ran a prepared fast hit that immediately reduced the final round to a 4v2. Xi Lai Gaming ended Haven 13-6, surviving elimination with the 2-1 victory.</p>

<p>The result means XLG will need to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/430857/edward-gaming-vs-xi-lai-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-kickoff-lr3" target="_blank">play against EDward Gaming</a>, the region&#39;s historical juggernaut, to continue their lower bracket run and earn Championship points. JDG Esports, on the other hand, is eliminated from the event, another international tournament evading the organization.</p>
