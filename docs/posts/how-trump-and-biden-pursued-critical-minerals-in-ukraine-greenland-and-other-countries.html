They also caught the attention of President Joseph R.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada told a group of business leaders that Mr. Trump’s focus on Canada’s minerals meant his threats to annex the country were “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/canada/trump-canada-trudeau.html" title="">a real thing</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Seizing mineral wealth overseas has become a core foreign policy goal of Mr. Trump’s and an impetus for his most imperialistic remarks since taking office.

They are found around the world — including in Chile and Argentina, the Chinese-controlled Tibetan plateau, and the Democratic Republic of Congo — and are integral to common technologies (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/business/economy/minerals-electric-cars-batteries.html" title="">electric car batteries</a>) and specialized ones (missile systems). In 2022, the U.S. Geological Survey released a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/24/2022-04027/2022-final-list-of-critical-minerals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list</a> of 50 critical minerals that ranges from aluminum to zirconium.</p><p>Because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html" title="">competition with China</a>, the search for critical minerals has been important to the United States for nearly a decade.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Biden, on the final overseas trip of his presidency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/world/africa/biden-angola-africa-lobito-train-corridor.html" title="">visited a U.S.-supported railway</a> in Angola that would help <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-biden-remarks-in-africa-on-lobito-corridor-railway-project/652819" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transport critical minerals</a> from central Africa to the coast for export. </p><p>State Department officials in his administration earlier set up a group of allied nations to discuss creating or reinforcing critical mineral supply chains outside of China. And they established a sister forum so that mineral-rich countries could speak to potential client nations and foreign companies about developing mines and processing plants.</p><p>Ukraine, Greenland and Canada were all part of that. In fact, Ukraine and the United States came close to signing an agreement last fall in which Ukraine would have promised to give the United States a heads up on potential projects, allowing American companies or those of allied nations enough lead time to bid for contracts. The State Department would also have given Ukraine technical assistance on mapping and writing regulations.</p><p>That has not been Mr. Trump’s approach.</p><p>“Trump and his aides are talking in a way that is unnecessary,” said Jose W. Fernandez, who was an architect of the State Department’s initiatives on critical minerals in the Biden administration. “These are countries that want investment. But they want partnerships. They are not looking for a colonial relationship.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He added that these countries were attracted to American financial and commercial partners because they did not like more coercive options, including proposals from China.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bucket-wheel excavators mining rare earth materials on Ukrainian soil in the Zhytomyr region this week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Last September, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine began presenting a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“victory plan” against Russia</a> to allied governments as well as to Mr. Trump, who was running for president, that, among other things, offered partnerships on critical minerals.</p><p>Mr. Fernandez was scheduled to sign a memorandum of understanding last October with a deputy prime minister of Ukraine, Yulia Svyrydenko, the State Department said in an email sent to reporters at the time. But on Oct. 29, the day of the scheduled signing, she did not show up in Washington.</p><p>Ms. Svyrydenko was then supposed to sign the agreement at a Ukraine reconstruction conference in Warsaw on Nov. 13, but again did not appear.</p><p>By then Mr. Trump had won the election, and Ukrainian officials told U.S. diplomats that they preferred to wait to sign an agreement with the incoming administration, according to two former U.S. officials and a Ukrainian official with knowledge of the events.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ukrainian officials had already been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html" title="">talking with some foreign businesspeople</a>, including Ronald S. Lauder, a cosmetics heir who is a friend of Mr. Trump’s, about investment opportunities in Ukraine’s mineral sector.</p><p>Earlier this month, Mr. Zelensky balked at the terms that Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, presented to him in Kyiv. The proposal called for Ukraine to give the United States half of its revenues from natural resources, including minerals, gas and oil, as well as earnings from ports and other infrastructure.</p><p>Mr. Trump also initially demanded $500 billion for the United States. He said America deserved payment for the billions in weapons and budget aid it gave Ukraine during the Biden administration, even though the amount was a tiny fraction of annual U.S. federal spending. Critics called Mr. Trump’s terms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/trump-us-ukraine-mineral-deal.html" title="">rapacious</a>, colonialist and mercantilist.</p><p>U.S. officials tempered some of the demands while continuing to pressure Ms. Svyrydenko and other Ukrainian negotiators to sign a deal. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-mineral-deal-trump.html" title="">current draft framework</a> has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/europe/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-security.html" title="">vague reference</a> to security guarantees for Ukraine, which Mr. Zelensky has said are essential for preventing Russia from trying to launch another invasion after any future cease-fire to end the war. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-official-suggests-us-mineral-deal-terms-improved/story?id=119199649" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump said Wednesday</a> that he does not plan to give “very much” of a guarantee.</p><p>“Many countries view their natural resources as central to national sovereignty and economic development potential,” said Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, an energy security research group. “This makes negotiations over critical minerals highly sensitive, with governments wary of foreign control or exploitation.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers crush cobalt at the Kasulu mine in Kolwezi, Democratic Republic of Congo, in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ashley Gilbertson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>China has been on a yearslong push to develop global dominance in extracting and processing critical minerals.

China is the top producer for 29 of the minerals.</p><p>And “China has repeatedly shown its willingness to weaponize these minerals,” the report said — including imposing export controls and bans in the last two years on a range of raw minerals. Furthermore, it said, China now refines between 40 to 90 percent of the globe’s supply of rare earth elements, graphite, lithium, cobalt and copper.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-13817-federal-strategy-ensure-secure-and-reliable-supplies-critical" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> Mr. Trump signed in 2017 was intended to “ensure secure and reliable” supplies of critical minerals.
