    <h1>Tesla Chair Denies That Board Sought to Replace Elon Musk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the company reported a 71 percent drop in quarterly profit last week, Mr. Musk promised to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html" title="">spend more time at Tesla</a> and less time in Washington. He said that he would spend one or two days a week on administration work.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s absence from Tesla while he oversaw Mr. Trump’s efforts to slash government spending and cut federal government jobs has become a sore point with investors. Mr. Musk’s involvement with the administration and with right-wing causes in Europe has prompted protests at Tesla dealerships and is partly responsible for a steep drop in sales. Electric vehicle buyers tend to be liberals or centrists.</p><p>Tesla’s revenue fell 9 percent in the first quarter of the year, to $19.3 billion, the company reported last week.</p><p>The automaker has lost market share in the United States, China and Europe as competitors like BYD, General Motors, Volkswagen and other companies introduce dozens of electric models. Analysts have faulted Tesla for failing to expand its lineup beyond two main cars.</p><p>The Model Y sport utility vehicle and the Model 3 sedan account for a vast majority of Tesla’s sales. The Cybertruck, Tesla’s newest vehicle, has not sold as well as Mr. Musk said it would.</p></div></div>
