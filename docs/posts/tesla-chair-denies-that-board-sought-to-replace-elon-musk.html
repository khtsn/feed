He said that he would spend one or two days a week on administration work.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s absence from Tesla while he oversaw Mr. Trump’s efforts to slash government spending and cut federal government jobs has become a sore point with investors. Mr. Musk’s involvement with the administration and with right-wing causes in Europe has prompted protests at Tesla dealerships and is partly responsible for a steep drop in sales. Electric vehicle buyers tend to be liberals or centrists.</p><p>Tesla’s revenue fell 9 percent in the first quarter of the year, to $19.3 billion, the company reported last week.</p><p>The automaker has lost market share in the United States, China and Europe as competitors like BYD, General Motors, Volkswagen and other companies introduce dozens of electric models. Analysts have faulted Tesla for failing to expand its lineup beyond two main cars.</p><p>The Model Y sport utility vehicle and the Model 3 sedan account for a vast majority of Tesla’s sales. The Cybertruck, Tesla’s newest vehicle, has not sold as well as Mr. Musk said it would.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jack Ewing covers the auto industry for The Times, with an emphasis on electric vehicles.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>100 Days in</strong> <strong>8 Charts: </strong>A slew of<strong> </strong>executive orders, an explosion of lawsuits, the plunging dollar, falling markets, a quiet State Department, medical research slowed: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/29/upshot/trump-100-days-charts.html">Trump&#39;s growing unpopularity and an increase in tariff revenue can all be traced in these charts.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>America&#39;s New Trajectory: </strong>Having escaped prison and death, President Trump has returned to power seeking vindication and vengeance — and done more in his first 100 days to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-100-days-second-term.html">change the trajectory of the country</a> than any president since Franklin D.
