It goes far beyond the scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (known as CFIUS), which typically reviews deals for potential national security risks.</p><p><strong>Key to this is the golden share. </strong>It would effectively allow Washington to inject itself into the fabric of a foreign-owned, yet strategically critical, American enterprise.</p><p>This echoes the governance models of nationalized industries in Europe and elsewhere, a stark departure from America’s historically hands-off approach. (Exceptions in the U.S. have included the government-backed rescues of General Motors and Chrysler.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Beijing, for instance, has taken a stake in China’s tech giants, including Alibaba. The French and Brazilian governments hold significant stakes in national aerospace champions.</p><p>Will this become the new blueprint<strong> </strong>for high-stakes foreign direct investment — or outright acquisitions — in the U.S., particularly in strategic sectors like manufacturing, technology or defense?</p><p><strong>Could this be a model for a TikTok deal? </strong>“Whatever the rights are that are in this golden share in Nippon-U.S. Steel, it’s worth asking: How would that look in the TikTok context, and would that solve the concern that people have with TikTok?,” Edward Rock, co-director of N.Y.U. Law School’s Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance, told DealBook.</p><p>A golden share could grant the government more say in the video app’s operations, such as preventing it from transferring American customers’ data abroad without government approval, he added.</p><p><strong>The reciprocity question looms large, too.</strong> If the U.S. were to demand a golden share in certain cross-border deals, could other nations impose similar restrictions on American companies investing within their borders? While such demands occur in some other countries, this precedent could formalize and expand the practice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“What you might see is other countries retaliating, just in the same way they do with tariffs,” said Lawrence Cunningham, the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p><p><strong>Another wild card: </strong>Imagine a future in which a highly ideological administration uses its golden share to push for politically driven hiring mandates, board shake-ups, headquarters relocations or production quotas that run counter to the interests of the business or shareholders. It’s not so far-fetched given President Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/arts/music/trump-kennedy-center-chairman.html" title="">recent board purge</a> at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.</p><p>If the government’s authority is open-ended, extending beyond matters of national security and into corporate governance and operational decisions, that would be “both unprecedented and a little bit scary,” said Jill Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>Christine Lagarde weighed leaving the E.C.B. early, the World Economic Forum’s founder says.</strong> Lagarde had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6bd1bd41-0ede-45a6-9a7e-d9efae75d309" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussed stepping down</a> as president of the European Central Bank ahead of schedule to become the forum’s chair, Klaus Schwab, the nonprofit group’s founder, told The Financial Times. Lagarde had pledged to serve out her term at the bank; Schwab stepped down last month amid an investigation into accusations of financial improprieties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>The Trump administration pauses interviews for student visas. </strong>The State Department ordered U.S. embassies and consulates to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/politics/trump-student-visas-interviews.html" title="">temporarily halt appointments</a> for foreign applicants as it seeks to expand scrutiny of their social media feeds. It casts a new spotlight on international students at American universities, after the administration moved to freeze Harvard’s ability to enroll those from abroad.</p><p><strong>SpaceX loses another Starship during testing.</strong> The rocket, the largest built, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/science/spacex-starship-launch-elon-musk-mars.html" title="">broke apart midflight</a> on Tuesday, though it made more progress than during previous missions.

It’s the third ruling to block executive orders by President Trump meant to subjugate firms tied to the president’s perceived political opponents.</p><p>The losing streak has many in the legal profession grumbling that major firms that <em>did</em> settle with Trump should have stood their ground.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>A reminder of the threats: </strong>The executive orders sought to strip firms’ lawyers of their security clearances and bar them from entering federal courthouses, threatening their ability to do business.</p><p><strong>“This order must be struck down in its entirety as unconstitutional,”</strong> Judge Richard Leon of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278933/gov.uscourts.dcd.278933.110.0_2.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">73-page opinion</a>.</p><p>Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush, made clear how strongly he feels:</p><ul><li><p>He used more than two dozen exclamation points. An example: “To rule otherwise would be unfaithful to the judgment and vision of the Founding Fathers!”</p></li><li><p>He compared Trump’s WilmerHale executive order <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/1kwy8le/comment/mul2e90/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at length to a gumbo</a> that “gives the Court heartburn.”</p></li><li><p>He described it as imposing “a kitchen sink of <em>severe</em> sanctions on WilmerHale for this protected conduct!” of free speech.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Other judges have also strongly ruled against Trump’s efforts to punish law firms,</strong> which include <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-law-firms.html" title="">Perkins Coie</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-jenner-block-law-firm.html" title="">Jenner &amp; Block</a>. (A fourth firm, Susman Godfrey, has won a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-blocks-most-trump-executive-order-against-law-firm-susman-godfrey-2025-04-15/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporary restraining order</a> pending a formal ruling.) </p><p><strong>Recriminations are flying within the legal profession,</strong> as lawyers who objected to other firms cutting deals with Trump — including Paul Weiss, Skadden, Latham &amp; Watkins and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett — fumed that they should have also fought back.</p><p>Some of those firms are finding that their agreement to provide pro bono legal work to causes Trump favors has opened them up to demands for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/business/trump-law-firms-pro-bono.html" title="">services from the president’s allies</a>. They’ve already suffered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/trump-law-firms-skadden-paul-weiss.html" title="">internal discord</a> and lost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/business/karen-dunn-paul-weiss-partners.html" title="">prominent</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/paul-weiss-steven-banks-trump.html" title="">practitioners</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>The counterargument:</strong> Firms under fire from Trump found themselves under pressure from rivals eager to poach top partners and clients. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/paul-weiss-trump-deal.html" title="">Many in Paul Weiss</a>, for example, feared that the star deal maker Scott Barshay might leave and take others with him, though Barshay said he wouldn’t go.)</p><p>Even a little uncertainty, proponents of settling said, could prompt an exodus of lawyers and clients.</p><p>Leon acknowledged that risk, noting that the executive order against WilmerHale “pressures these clients to abandon WilmerHale or face loss of their contracts.” Of arguments by the administration that any injuries were speculative, the judge wrote, “Please — that dog won’t hunt!”</p><hr/><h2 id="link-4b74e153">“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.”</h2><p><em>— </em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-disappointed-by-trump-big-beautiful-bill-doge/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Elon Musk</em></a><em>, to CBS News.

But Trump’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-emergency-oil-gas.html" title="">drill, baby, drill</a>” policy is slamming the energy majors’ profit outlook and share prices.</p><p>That’s driven a wedge between the oil patch and Washington before Wednesday’s annual shareholder meetings for Exxon Mobil and Chevron. In recent regulatory filings, Exxon and Chevron signaled little willingness to significantly bolster domestic drilling, a key lever in Trump’s fight against inflation, Vivienne Walt reports for DealBook.</p><p><strong>Frustration in the industry is bubbling.</strong> <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2501#tab-comments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a survey published in March of about 200 executives</a> conducted by the Dallas Fed, one unnamed respondent said: “The administration’s chaos is a disaster for the commodity markets. ‘Drill, baby, drill’ is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry.”</p><p><strong>Oil is too cheap, </strong>leading<strong> </strong>most producers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/energy-environment/oil-trump-drill-baby-drill.html" title="">pause expansion plans</a>. “To stimulate new activity, oil prices need to be in the $75-$80 per barrel range,” <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2501#tab-comments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another industry executive</a> wrote in the survey; Brent crude, the global benchmark, has hovered well below that for months.

Meanwhile, economic volatility and global trade uncertainty are expected to force producers <a href="https://www.rigzone.com/news/sp_global_says_usa_crude_oil_production_now_expected_to_decline_in_2026-14-may-2025-180523-article/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to cut production</a> next year, analysts at S&amp;P Global forecast.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Treasury Department granted Chevron <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/us-issues-limited-license-for-chevron-to-continue-in-venezuela?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a stripped-down permit</a> for its operations in Venezuela, a country in Trump’s cross hairs over immigration.
