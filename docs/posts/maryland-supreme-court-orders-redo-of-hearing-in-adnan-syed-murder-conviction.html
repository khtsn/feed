In 2023, the Appellate Court of Maryland <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/us/adnan-syed-serial-conviction-reinstated.html" title="">reinstated</a> it, ruling that a lower court had violated the right of Ms. Lee’s brother, Young Lee, to have been notified of and attend the hearing.</p><p>Ms. Lee was killed by strangulation in 1999 at 18 years old. She had been a student at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Md. Mr. Syed spent 23 years in prison fighting charges that he had killed her.</p><p>The court upheld an appellate court’s decision to reinstate his conviction. In the <a href="https://www.mdcourts.gov/data/opinions/coa/2024/7a23.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion filed on Friday,</a> the Supreme Court of Maryland agreed that the rights of Mr. Lee had been violated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The high court’s ruling said that the prosecutor gave Mr. Lee “less than one business day’s notice” for the in-person hearing, and that his request for a one-week postponement was denied.</p><p>The filing said that “Mr. Lee’s rights as the crime victim’s representative were violated,” adding that the case would be remanded to the circuit court for Baltimore City for further proceedings.</p><p>The decision by the Maryland Supreme Court, which passed with a 4-3 ruling, meant that Mr. Syed’s murder conviction would remain reinstated. It was the latest development in a long-running saga surrounding the case.</p><p>The justices did not order changes to Mr. Syed’s release, meaning he can remain free as the lower court decides on the conviction.</p><p>The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office said in a statement: “The decision is currently under review by our office and we have no further comment at this time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>David Sanford, who represents the family of Ms. Lee, said in a statement: “If there is compelling evidence to support vacating the conviction of Adnan Syed, we will be the first to agree.” He added, “To date, the public has not seen evidence which would warrant overturning a murder conviction that has withstood appeals for over two decades.&#34;</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Christine Hauser writes breaking news stories, features and explainers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christine-hauser">More about Christine Hauser</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/adnan-syed">Adnan Syed</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/hae-min-lee">Hae Min Lee</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
