In 2023, the Appellate Court of Maryland <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/us/adnan-syed-serial-conviction-reinstated.html" title="">reinstated</a> it, ruling that a lower court had violated the right of Ms. Lee’s brother, Young Lee, to have been notified of and attend the hearing.</p><p>Ms. Lee was killed by strangulation in 1999 at 18 years old. She had been a student at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Md. Mr. Syed was convicted in 2000 of first-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery and false imprisonment. He spent 23 years in prison, fighting charges that he had killed her.</p><p>The court upheld an appellate court’s decision to reinstate his conviction. In the <a href="https://www.mdcourts.gov/data/opinions/coa/2024/7a23.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion filed on Friday,</a> the Supreme Court of Maryland agreed that the rights of Mr. Lee had been violated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The high court’s ruling said that the prosecutor gave Mr. Lee “less than one business day’s notice” for the in-person hearing, and that his request for a one-week postponement was denied.</p><p>The filing said that “Mr. Lee’s rights as the crime victim’s representative were violated,” adding that the case would be remanded to the circuit court for Baltimore City for further proceedings.</p><p>Mr. Syed has maintained his innocence throughout the long-running legal saga.</p><p>The decision by the Maryland Supreme Court, which passed with a 4-3 ruling, meant that Mr. Syed’s murder conviction would remain reinstated. In dissenting opinions, justices reflected on the legal twists and turns in the case, saying that legal guidelines did not specify the minimum amount of advance notice required for a hearing, and citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/us/adnan-syed-charges-dropped.html" title="">the state’s decision to drop charges in 2022</a>, when testing of items belonging to Ms. Lee did not find Mr. Syed’s DNA.</p><p>“This case exists as a procedural zombie,” wrote Justice Michele Hotten. “It has been reanimated, despite its expiration.”</p><p>The justices did not order changes to Mr. Syed’s release, meaning he can remain free as the lower court decides on the conviction.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Erica J. Suter, the lawyer for Mr. Syed, said in a statement that the court’s decision reflected issues of process rather than challenges to the substance of the case, which included the debunking of initial evidence and DNA testing results.</p><p>The court “reached a result that we could not disagree with more,” she said.</p><p>“As this appeal was not about Adnan’s innocence, it was also never a challenge to the suffering that the Lee family has endured,” she said. “Wrongful convictions devastate the wrongly accused, their family, and the family of the victim.”</p><p>David Sanford, who represents the family of Ms. Lee, said the court decision affirmed that “the family of murder victim Hae Min Lee had the right to reasonable notice in order to attend and meaningfully participate in the criminal justice proceedings involving Adnan Syed, the person accused and convicted of Lee’s murder.”</p><p>“If there is compelling evidence to support vacating the conviction of Adnan Syed, we will be the first to agree,” he said. He also said there was not sufficient evidence to “warrant overturning a murder conviction that has withstood appeals for over two decades.</p><p>The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office said in a statement: “The decision is currently under review by our office and we have no further comment at this time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Christine Hauser writes breaking news stories, features and explainers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christine-hauser">More about Christine Hauser</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/adnan-syed">Adnan Syed</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/hae-min-lee">Hae Min Lee</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
