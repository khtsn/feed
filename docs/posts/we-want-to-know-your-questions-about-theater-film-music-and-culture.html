What should I read? What do I need to see while I’m in town?</p><p>But also: How do I know when to clap during an orchestra concert? Can I bring my slightly schlumpy friend to the opera? Is there a right way to start watching the “Real Housewives” shows? What do I do if I’m late to a Broadway show? </p><p>We want to know what questions you have about culture, in all its wonderful but sometimes complicated, intimidating or confusing forms, and across all the genres, whether that’s theater, music, movies, dance, TV, art, video games or something that isn’t so easy to label. What have you always wondered about? (Is it whether the American or the British version of “The Office” is the better one?) What would you ask one of our critics or reporters if you met them in person?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Fill out this form, and Times journalists may publish an answer to your question. We’ll never publish or share your contact information, but we’ll use it to reach out to you to let you know that we’re addressing your question, and then share the answer once it’s published.</p></div></section></article></div>
