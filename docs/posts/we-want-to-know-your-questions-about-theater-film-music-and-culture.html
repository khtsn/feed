    <h1>We Want to Know Your Questions About Theater, Film, Music and Culture</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you work on arts and entertainment coverage, and part of the job is keeping up with what’s on TV, or Broadway, or at the Met (both the museum and the opera house), people in your life invariably have questions: What should I watch? What should I read? What do I need to see while I’m in town?</p><p>But also: How do I know when to clap during an orchestra concert? Can I bring my slightly schlumpy friend to the opera? Is there a right way to start watching the “Real Housewives” shows? What do I do if I’m late to a Broadway show? </p><p>We want to know what questions you have about culture, in all its wonderful but sometimes complicated, intimidating or confusing forms, and across all the genres, whether that’s theater, music, movies, dance, TV, art, video games or something that isn’t so easy to label. What have you always wondered about? (Is it whether the American or the British version of “The Office” is the better one?) What would you ask one of our critics or reporters if you met them in person?</p></div></div>
