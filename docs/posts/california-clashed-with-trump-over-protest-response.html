    <h1>California Clashed With Trump Over Protest Response</h1>

Over the weekend, the authorities responded to pockets of violence with crowd-control munitions, tear gas and flash-bang grenades.</p><p>President Trump responded by sidestepping the state’s Democratic governor and deploying 2,000 National Guard members to the city. He portrayed the demonstrations as an existential threat to the country, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/trump-los-angeles-protestors-insurrectionists.html" title="">called the protesters “insurrectionists,”</a> in what may become a rationale for him to invoke the Insurrection Act.</p><p>Defense officials also said that a battalion of 500 Marines was “being mobilized” to help quell protests in Los Angeles.</p><p>California officials argued that Trump’s decision to deploy troops had violated the Constitution and inflamed tensions. The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/california-lawsuit-national-guard-protests-trump.html" title="">state would sue the president</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jay Bhattacharya, center, director of the National Institutes of Health, at the White House last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1ac140ae">Federal health workers denounced Trump’s policies</h2><p>More than 60 employees of the National Institutes of Health <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/health/nih-letter-trump-bhattacharya.html" title="">signed a scathing letter</a> criticizing what they described as the degradation of the country’s medical research apparatus under Trump.</p><p>The employees accused the administration of illegally withholding money, endangering participants in studies and censoring critical research.

In January 2024, for example, more than 40 percent of the world’s oceans had reached temperatures that qualify as a marine heat wave. The hotter waters are causing drastic changes to marine life, sea levels and weather patterns.
