It was the first time since the cease-fire that Hezbollah fired into Israel-controlled land. Both Lebanon and Israel claim Shebaa Farms as their own. Hezbollah said the strike was meant as a warning.</p><p>Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called the Hezbollah strike “a severe violation of the cease-fire” and pledged in a statement on Monday that Israel “will respond forcefully.”</p><p>After the strike on Shebaa Farms, the Israeli military said that it had bombarded targets in Lebanon. Israeli strikes on Monday, including those in response to Hezbollah’s actions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-lebanon.html" title="">killed at least 11 people</a>, said Lebanon’s <a href="https://x.com/mophleb/status/1863693551718089034" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">health ministry</a>, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><h2 id="link-3b50fef0">What the cease-fire deal really says.</h2><p>Even amid the strikes, the fragile truce apparently remains in place, and experts say that it could still stick.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Under the terms of the deal, which was brokered by the United States and France, Israel has 60 days to withdraw its military from Lebanon, while Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw north of the Litani River, leaving a buffer in southern Lebanon between the militant group and Israel’s northern border. The Lebanese Army, which is not a party to the conflict, is supposed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/lebanon-army-ceasefire-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">oversee and enforce security there</a>.</p><p>The Israeli withdrawal is expected to happen in phases. The details are not yet worked out and are supposed to be negotiated with the Lebanese Army and overseen by an international committee chaired by the United States. Israeli officials have said repeatedly that during that time they will respond to any provocation, and they have told civilians not to return yet to southern Lebanon.</p><p>The implementation period was written into the deal for a reason, Mr. Miller said. “Hiccups, glitches and violations” are to be expected in the early days — and no one can say yet what that will mean for the ultimate viability of the deal, he said.</p><p>“If you can get through 60 days without a collapse of the agreement, then you will have a strategic pause,” he said, which might prove to be viable long-term.</p><h2 id="link-36d8c4a3">Can the deal hold, even with violations?</h2><p>The initial claims of infractions show the fragility of the deal and the difficulty of enforcing agreements under international law more broadly, said Jennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a foreign policy institute in Washington. It’s one thing to sign an agreement, she said, and altogether another to enforce it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Under the terms of the agreement, both Israel and Lebanon can exercise their right to self defense, as long as it’s consistent with international law. The details and enforcement mechanisms remain hazy.</p><p>The United States and France, alongside the United Nations, are supposed to play a role in assessing violations. But it is not clear whether any mechanisms are fully in place at this point or how they are supposed to work.</p><p>Israel’s leaders have said they will “enforce” the deal militarily, arguing that even small violations could embolden the Lebanese armed group.</p><p>Despite the uncertainties, the fact that Israel and Lebanon reached an agreement, and that Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said it would abide by the terms, shows that — for now — all involved see benefit to a pause, experts said.</p><p>Ms. Kavanagh said she expected violations and failures but was not entirely pessimistic, because all sides “have incentives to make it work.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The conflict may not be resolved in the long run, Mr. Miller said, but he advised against being overly swayed by daily headlines about violations.</p><p>For now, he said, “commitments will be measured over a two-month period.”</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Euan Ward<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>American Killed on Oct. 7:</strong> Omer Neutra, an American Israeli dual citizen who fought in the Israeli military and was thought to have been taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/middleeast/omer-neutra-israel-oct-7-gaza-hamas-hostage.html">was in fact killed on the day of the attack</a>, the military said.</p></li><li><p><strong>World Central Kitchen Worker:</strong> Israel said it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-world-central-kitchen.html">killed a World Central Kitchen worker</a> it accused of taking part in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack. “To the best of our knowledge, no WCK team members are affiliated with Hamas,” the aid group said.</p></li><li><p><strong>‘Nobody Won’:</strong> Tens of thousands of people who had fled the Lebanese city of Baalbek returned to bombed-out restaurants, flattened apartment buildings and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/middleeast/baalbek-lebanon-israel.html">many of the dead still buried under the rubble</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Independent Inquiry Into Oct. 7 Failures:</strong> After the Israeli government delayed a formal investigation into the Hamas attacks, an alliance of survivors and victims’ families set up their own inquiry. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/middleeast/israel-oct-7-inquiry.html">Their scathing findings were released</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rallying Around Netanyahu:</strong> An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-icc-jurisdiction-explained.html">I.C.C. arrest warrant</a> for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spurred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-icc-warrant.html">outrage across Israel’s political spectrum</a>.
