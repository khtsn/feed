    <h1>Louisiana Shuts 100-Mile Stretch of I-10 as Rare Snowstorm Hits Gulf Coast</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The authorities in Louisiana on Wednesday closed a 100-mile stretch of Interstate 10 that spans nearly half the state, as a powerful winter storm brought record snowfall to the Gulf Coast and triggered the stateâ€™s first-ever blizzard warning.</p><p>The <a href="https://wwwapps.dotd.la.gov/administration/announcements/Announcement.aspx?key=37557" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a> shortly after midnight meant that 200 miles of the highway in Louisiana were closed because of deteriorating conditions. The authorities had previously closed a 50-mile stretch between Baton Rouge and Lafayette, and another 50 miles in and around New Orleans since early Tuesday.</p><p>The eight inches of snow that fell at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Tuesday beat a record of 2.7 inches set in 1963, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>Interstate 10 is <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwayhistory/data/page07.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of three</a> highways that run coast-to-coast in the United States and a crucial east-west link for the southern Louisiana cities of New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Its <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/interstate_highway_system/routefinder/table01.cfm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">span in Louisiana</a> is just under 275 miles, and connects the state with Mississippi and Texas.</p></div></div>
