    <h1>The Economy Looks Strong as Election Day Nears</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Consumers are spending, inflation is cooling, and the American <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/economy/economy-gdp-report.html" title="">economy appears to be on solid footing</a>, according to a government report released today that showed that G.D.P. expanded at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter.</p><p>Less than a week before Election Day, the continued growth offers voters an indication that the economy has rebounded since the pandemic. However, after years of high inflation, a large majority of voters rate the economy as only fair or poor. The lasting discontent could play a crucial role in deciding the next president. </p><p>Voters in the latest Times poll rated the economy as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/elections/trump-harris-economy-poll.html" title="">the most important issue in the election</a>, as they have in every Times poll this year. They have also said in each poll that they trusted Donald Trump on the economy more than Kamala Harris, though Harris has closed the gap to six points from 13 over the last month.</p><p>“When Trump taps into voters’ concerns over the economy, it can be very effective,” my colleague, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-gold" title="">Michael Gold</a>, who covers Trump’s campaign, told me. “A lot of voters see the economy as a referendum on the current administration, and when Trump focuses on that, he can be very strong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>After the floods in the Valencia region of Spain.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Ramos/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-339d1f87">Flash floods killed more than 95 people in Spain</h2><p>At least 95 people died and others were missing after devastating flash floods hit eastern Spain, the local authorities said. The toll is expected to rise.
