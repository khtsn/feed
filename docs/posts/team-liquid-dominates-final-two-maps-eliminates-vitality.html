</span> in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594768/team-vitality-vs-team-liquid-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-lr5" target="_blank">a 2-1 fashion</a>. The European superteam from Vitality started strong, but Liquid was dominant on the final two maps to reverse sweep the three-map series and stay alive at Kickoff.</p>

<p>Starting on Corrode, Vitality ran double-Duelist Phoenix Yoru with a Chamber, while Liquid ran double-Duelist with Waylay and Yoru instead. Vitality won the first pistol, converted the bonus, and ran ahead to a 6-0 lead. Liquid managed to stop that run, but only by a little, as Vitality reached the half up 10-2. <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/5022/derke">
		Derke	</a>
</span> was on fire in the first half, ending it with 15 kills. Team Liquid won the second pistol, but was unable to convert the bonus. Due to the big deficit, that bonus win was needed, as Vitality eventually closed out map one 13-8.</p>

<p>Bind was a needed fresh start for Liquid, who ran double-Duelist with Waylay and Neon to face off against the double-Controller and double-Initiator from Vitality. Liquid won the first pistol, and even after losing the bonus, jumped to a 5-2 lead. The defense from Liquid was amazing, with both <span data-ref-id="3">

		nAts	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/18350/miniboo">
		MiniBoo	</a>
</span> moving to comfort agents in Viper and Neon, respectively. Up 9-3 at the half, Liquid was perfect in the second half to end Bind 13-3 and quickly move the series to map three.</p>

<p>Breeze was the decider, with both teams running double-Duelist, but Liquid stuck to Neon while Derke moved onto Jett. Liquid earned another pistol win, but Vitality prevented that bonus round win to keep the half within reach. An important early round was won off a 1v3 by <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/24628/wayne">
		wayne	</a>
</span>, doing so with 5 HP.</p>


<p><em>wayne wins a 1v3 clutch on 5 HP.</em></p>

<p>Even when Vitality would earn a round win, Liquid would win a big thrifty off some sleek <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/14681/kamo">
		kamo	</a>
</span> Sheriff shots. The moments were pure chaos as kamo led Liquid to a 9-3 lead at the half. Vitality needed to win the second pistol, but it wasn&#39;t meant to be. Team Liquid frequently bashed its head into the wall of B site hits, giving Vitality confidence to try and come back from a 12-3 deficit. That was until Team Liquid ran a successful A site hit, and that ended the map 13-9 and the series 2-1.</p>

<p>With this win, Team Liquid will face off against the loser of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594760/gentle-mates-vs-fnatic-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-mbf" target="_blank">the middle bracket finals</a> in <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/594769/team-liquid-vs-tbd-vct-2026-emea-kickoff-lbf" target="_blank">the lower finals</a> for that final EMEA slot at Masters Santiago.</p>
