He said the wait was “excruciating” but that Italy had done “exceptional work.”</p><p>A photo posted later in the day on Il Post, the online newspaper where Mr. Raineri works as a foreign correspondent, showed Ms. Sala and Mr. Raineri hugging on the tarmac.</p><p>Another photo showed her alongside Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the country’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, and the mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri.</p><p>It was unclear how Italy obtained the release of Ms. Sala.</p><p>She was taken into custody three days after the police in Milan arrested Mohammad Abedini Najafabadi, a 38-year-old Iranian, on behalf of the United States. Mr. Abedini was accused by the United States of providing drone components to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — the country’s primary military force.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Iranian authorities said on Dec. 25 that they expected “the Italian government to prevent the violation of the human rights of the Iranian citizen who has been unjustly accused by the United States.”</p><p>Iran has often jailed foreigners and dual nationals to extract concessions from their countries, including prisoner swaps, but Iranian officials said on Monday that there had been no connection between Mr. Abedini’s arrest and Ms. Sala’s.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Abedini’s lawyer in Italy, Alfredo De Francesco, said he was happy about Ms. Sala’s release and now needed to focus on his client’s case. He did not respond to questions about developments on Mr. Abedini’s case.</p><p>Ms. Sala’s visit to Iran was her first since 2021, and since then, much had changed in the country. A new president had been elected, its shadow war with Israel had moved into the open, and Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria and a longtime ally, had recently been ousted.</p><p>Ms. Sala, a writer and podcaster, set out to document the shifting atmosphere. She interviewed a standup comedian, and she photographed women in cafes and on the streets who were not wearing head scarves, posting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDmy27-tycO/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a selection of images</a> on Instagram last month and describing them as “Tehran’s new faces and new streets.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The news of Ms. Sala’s detention became public on Dec. 27, after she received a visit from Italy’s ambassador to Iran. It dominated media coverage in Italy, and President Sergio Mattarella mentioned her case in his end of year message.</p><p>On Wednesday, Chora Media, a company that posts podcasts by Ms. Sala, put up a new episode of her show. It contained an interview with her mother after she received word of her daughter’s release.</p><p>It also carried Ms. Sala’s first words at the airport. “Hi, I am back,” she said.</p><p>Leily Nikounazar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
