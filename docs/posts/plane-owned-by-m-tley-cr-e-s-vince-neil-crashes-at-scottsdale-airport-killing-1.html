The Learjet’s left main gear failed as it landed, said Kelli Kuester, the aviation planning and outreach coordinator for the Scottsdale Airport.</p><p>One person was dead at the scene, two others were taken to local trauma centers in critical condition and another was taken to a hospital in stable condition, Capt.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the episode.</p><p>Officials would not immediately release the names of the five people involved in the accident or say which plane they had been on. Mr. Robinson, the spokesman for Mr. Neil, said that two pilots and two passengers had been on board the plane. “More specific details regarding the collision are not available as this is a rapidly evolving situation,” Mr. Robinson said.</p><p>This collision came after a series of aviation disasters across the country in recent weeks.</p><p>In late January, a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines jet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/plane-crash-dc-helicopter-reagan-airport.html" title="">collided outside</a> Washington, killing all 67 people on board those flights. Seven people were killed after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/plane-crash-philadelphia-roosevelt-mall.html" title="">plane crashed near</a> a shopping center in Philadelphia on Jan. 31.
