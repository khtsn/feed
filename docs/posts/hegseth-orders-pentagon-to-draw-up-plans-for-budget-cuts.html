    <h1>Hegseth Orders Pentagon to Draw Up Plans for Budget Cuts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Hegseth has vowed to use thousands of active-duty U.S. troops to help stem the flow of migrants across the border, a top priority for President Trump. But illegal crossings, which reached record levels during the Biden administration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/border-immigration-drop-biden.html" title="">slowed significantly</a> before Mr. Trump took office last month.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, Robert G. Salesses, the acting deputy defense secretary, said the president’s “charge to the department is clear: to achieve peace through strength.”</p><p>He added that the Pentagon was undertaking the budget cuts with an aim of bolstering other priorities. “To achieve our mandate from President Trump,” he said, “we are guided by his priorities, including securing our borders, building the Iron Dome for America and ending radical and wasteful government D.E.I. programs and preferencing.”</p><p>In the memo issued on Tuesday, which Bloomberg reported earlier, Mr. Hegseth repeated a phrase he uses often about the need for the military to focus on “the warrior ethos.” He called for a rejection of “excessive bureaucracy” and unnecessary spending.</p><p>Any cuts to the defense budget may face opposition in Congress, where lawmakers often focus on budget cuts that could affect their districts.</p></div></div>
