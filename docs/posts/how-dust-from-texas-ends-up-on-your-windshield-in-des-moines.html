In the last month, at least 20 people have died in car crashes amid low or nonexistent visibility.</p><p>The impact of these dust storms stretched beyond the region. Strong winds carried the dust unusually far — hundreds of miles north and east — where it mixed with rain, leaving residents as far as the Mid-Atlantic puzzled by the orange residue coating their cars and homes.</p><p>Here’s a look at how a rare combination of drought and strong winds turned a relatively normal late-winter weather event into something far more unusual.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/us/politics/21wea-dust-1/21wea-dust-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/us/politics/21wea-dust-1/21wea-dust-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/us/politics/21wea-dust-1/21wea-dust-1-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A city skyline is obscured by a dust storm.

In Europe, it’s not uncommon for fine particles of sand from the deserts of northern Africa to get kicked up by warm, humid Saharan winds that blow from the south or the southeast across the Mediterranean Sea and into southern Europe. That dust can even get dragged as far north as Britain, where it’s sometimes referred to as “blood rain” because of its dirty hue.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Saharan dust covered a ski resort in France in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bastien Arberet/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>These storms can also happen just about anywhere in the United States, including eastern Washington and California’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/30/us/12-are-killed-as-dust-shrouds-highway.html" title="">Central Valley</a>.

It’s no coincidence that most of the Southwest and southern Plains are experiencing some level of <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drought</a>, and it’s especially bad in far West Texas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>In El Paso, there have been more days with low visibility from dust than clear ones so far this month, said Thomas Gill, a professor of environmental science and engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso. “It’s kind of the expected weather in spring, and we live with it,” he said. “But to have this dust that is so thick that you can barely see a block or two down the road and it looks like Mars, it’s really unusual to have a dust storm that bad, much less three in less than three weeks’ time.”</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Dry Winds Create Blinding Dust Storms in New Mexico and Texas</h2><h4>Dry winds fueled dust storms that limited visibility to near zero on some roadways and raised the risk of fires breaking out in the region.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“Look at this, several of these guys.” “I hope they all got out.” “Jeez.” “Oh, man.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/18/multimedia/18xp-wildfires-pzcm/18xp-wildfires-pzcm-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Dry winds fueled dust storms that limited visibility to near zero on some roadways and raised the risk of fires breaking out in the region.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Gabriela Campos/Santa Fe New Mexican, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-61b2a95b">Brownish snow fell as far as Iowa.</h2><p>There have been three main storms this month that have upended daily life in parts of the Southwest, southern Plains and Chihuahua, Mexico: one on March 3 and 4, one on March 14, last Friday, and one this week, on Tuesday.</p><p>And each time, dust from this unusually intense succession of storms did something even more unusual: It was lofted up and carried hundreds of miles north and east to other parts of North America.</p><p>National Weather Service offices <a href="https://x.com/NWSCharlestonWV/status/1898191320226931199" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Charleston, W.Va</a>., and <a href="https://x.com/NWSStLouis/status/1898177941265432615" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">St. Louis</a> have shared satellite images showing that dust from the Southwest had been swept up high into the atmosphere and then, as light rain moved through their regions, been pulled down to the ground.

Aaron Ward, a meteorologist with the Weather Service, said an 83 m.p.h. gust was recorded in Amarillo, Texas — among the strongest ever measured by his office, with records going back 175 years.</p><p>The dust from that event was carried well into Ontario by the next day, said Mr. Line.</p><p>The March 14 wind storm didn’t only whip up dust, it also caused wildfires to rapidly spread across Texas and Oklahoma. In detailed satellite imagery you could see the thick dispersion of dust sweeping east as well as the darker milky gray smoke plumes rising above the brown dust.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-17"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/19/autossell/dust-satellite-2/dust-satellite-2-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>NOAA/RAMMB/CIRA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
