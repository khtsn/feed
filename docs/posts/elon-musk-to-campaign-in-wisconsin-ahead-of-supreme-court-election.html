    <h1>Elon Musk to Campaign in Wisconsin Ahead of Supreme Court Election</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elon Musk is heading back to the campaign trail.</p><p>Mr. Musk, the Republican megadonor, said early Friday that he would be going to Wisconsin, apparently to campaign for the conservative candidate in a high-profile judicial contest. The visit, two days before the vote on Tuesday, appears to be his most direct engagement in the State Supreme Court election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/us/politics/elon-musk-brad-schimel-wisconsin-state-supreme-court.html" title="">which is being watched closely as a test of Mr. Musk’s influence.</a></p><p>Mr. Musk will deliver remarks in the state on Sunday evening, he said on X, without releasing other details. Nor did he mention the candidate, Brad Schimel, by name, saying simply that he would “give a talk in Wisconsin.”</p><p>Mr. Musk is reprising a few of the tactics he used in the final weeks of the presidential election, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/elections/elon-musk-town-hall-pennsylvania.html" title="">when he traveled across Pennsylvania</a> to assist Donald J. Trump’s campaign with a series of town halls. He is once again issuing personal checks to those who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/elon-musk-wisconsin-petition.html" title="">sign a petition</a> that his super PAC is circulating to registered voters and awarding $1 million randomly in sweepstakes-like gifts to signers. (Mr. Musk’s latest petition in Wisconsin is opposed to what he calls “the actions of activist judges.”)</p><p>Mr. Musk is also offering a new twist on at least some of these petition payouts: making them conditional not only on signing the petition and being a registered voter, but also on having already voted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-million-dollar-petition.html" title="">a legally contentious escalation</a> of his program. Mr. Musk said in his Friday post that he would “personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote.” Mr. Musk’s super PAC has awarded a $1 million check to one Wisconsin voter who signed the petition.</p></div></div>
