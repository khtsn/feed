An interviewee might, for example, raise an idea that chimes with something I’ve long been thinking about. Or I’ll find while doing research that someone’s work illuminates a problem I’d been dealing with. Two such surprises occurred with this week’s subject, the Academy Award-winning actress Tilda Swinton. Both shaped my feeling about the ensuing conversation, though in very different ways.</p></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-1"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>Listen to the Interview With Tilda Swinton</h3><p><span>The Academy Award-winning actress discusses her lifelong quest for connection, humanity’s innate goodness and the point of being alive.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>Subscribe: </strong><strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-interview/id1624946521" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a></strong><strong> | </strong><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7cDVEBbn8tM4vCEFM4TFA2?si=ccb3bbaadb75485f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spotify</a></strong><strong> | </strong><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdMrbgYfVl-s5c4ug8qDCNmdmSKPvr-Pi" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube</a></strong><strong> | </strong><strong><a href="https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/3c7db6c5-3de8-4bf0-b8b4-c540dc623cb7/the-interview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon</a></strong><strong> | </strong><strong><a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/326-the-interview-97152890/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iHeart</a></strong><strong> | </strong><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/audio/app/syndicated/audio-app-show-the-interview" title="">NYT Audio App</a></strong></p><p>The first: In a book of sketches and musings by the British writer John Berger called “Bento’s Sketchbook,” one drawing has always mesmerized me. It’s of an androgynous face with almond-shaped, almost alien eyes, and it exudes a deeply human compassion. That sketch is labeled, simply, “Tilda,” and I hadn’t much thought about upon whom it was based. Until, that is, when in preparation for my interview with Swinton, I watched a documentary she co-directed about Berger. In it, she mentions “Bento’s Sketchbook” — and a lightbulb went on. I’d long admired that sketch and Swinton’s daring, shape-shifting acting — in her avant-garde films with her mentor and friend Derek Jarman, her indie collaborations with directors like Bong Joon Ho and Wes Anderson and her Hollywood triumphs like “Michael Clayton” and the “Chronicles of Narnia” trilogy — but I’d never put together that I’d been entranced by the same person, the same presence, the whole time. I couldn’t help taking that as a good omen for the interview.</p><p>The second connection was harder to interpret. Readers of this column may remember that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/magazine/doctor-ellen-wiebe-maid-interview.html" title="">my last Q&amp;A</a> was with a doctor about medical aid in dying — a subject with which I’ve had recent personal experience. Swinton’s upcoming film, “The Room Next Door,” directed by the great Pedro Almodóvar and opening in select theaters on Dec. 20, is about — and I swear I didn’t know this ahead of time — a distressingly similar topic. In the movie, Swinton plays a woman named Martha, who asks her friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, to support her decision to die by suicide after becoming terminally ill. I would have felt disingenuous not to be open about this coincidence with Swinton, but I also wasn’t exactly eager to explore it. She, as it turns out, felt otherwise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>“The Room Next Door” is based on a novel by Sigrid Nunez, “What Are You Going Through,” which takes its title from a quote by the French philosopher Simone Weil: “The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say to him, what are you going through?” So what are </strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong> going through? </strong>I’m enjoying right now the attention to that question, and the fact that our film puts that question into the air. The idea of bearing witness, and the question of what is friendship, but even more than friendship, what is it to coexist? What is it to not look away? I think of it actually as a political film.</p><p><strong>I have questions about that, but I want to preface them by sharing what I hope is a morbidly humorous anecdote. </strong>Sounds good!</p><p><strong>The last interview I did was with a doctor in Canada who helps people die. The occasion of doing that interview was my mother’s having gone through that process earlier this year. So it was heavy for me. Then the opportunity arose to interview you, and I thought: </strong><strong><em>I love Tilda Swinton’s movies; I love the exuberance of Almodóvar’s work. This will be great.</em></strong><strong> </strong>It’ll be a laugh.</p><p><strong>So I went to the screening. Got popcorn, got Diet Coke, got M&amp;Ms. I get to my seat. I’m feeling good, and within a few minutes it dawns on me that your movie is about assisted suicide. Thanks.</strong> Welcome! I have to ask you, how did you feel at the end when you stood up and there were M&amp;Ms all around your feet and you had a sugar-rush headache? Because what you’ve described is quite a banquet of experience: your experience with your mother, your experience with this doctor and then to see a piece of art that’s swimming in the same material.</p><p><strong>I was not jazzed to revisit my emotions. But I felt glad that the subject was being treated in an emotionally truthful way, and I did feel some catharsis. How does that ring for you? </strong>I’m pleased to hear that. The reason I ask the question is that I’m thinking of what you just said: To come to a piece of art having been through the real lived experience with your mother is particularly piquant. Which we can unpack if we want to.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><strong>I’m sure readers have had enough of me being upset about my mother. I’ll move on. </strong>Here’s the thing, David: Moving on is, in many ways, grossly overrated.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/magazine/15mag-interview-swinton-03/15mag-interview-swinton-03-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/magazine/15mag-interview-swinton-03/15mag-interview-swinton-03-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/magazine/15mag-interview-swinton-03/15mag-interview-swinton-03-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/magazine/15mag-interview-swinton-03/15mag-interview-swinton-03-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/magazine/15mag-interview-swinton-03/15mag-interview-swinton-03-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/magazine/15mag-interview-swinton-03/15mag-interview-swinton-03-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/15/magazine/15mag-interview-swinton-03/15mag-interview-swinton-03-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/72943c86-aae0-5a37-bc9d-7f6de1bf8a9a" decoding="async" width="600" height="468"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tilda Swinton with the director Derek Jarman, her mentor and friend, in 1987.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Angus McBean/Ronald Grant Archive, via Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong><em>You’ve</em></strong><strong> gone through experiences similar to the one depicted in the film: being with people near the end. Can you tell me about that? </strong>Yes, it’s an enormous part of what I want to talk to you about. I have spent much of the last 15 years in the Ingrid position, the person that Julianne Moore plays: to both of my parents, to the father of my children and many other friends. But it’s something that has been in my lived experience since I was quite a young person. Derek Jarman was the first person I knew very closely and lived alongside tightly who got very ill. First with H.I.V. in 1988, 1989, and then died in ’94. He was the first person that I met who was looking down the barrel and did not look away. I always feel that mortality and immortality are basically the same thing, but what Derek modeled for me was something that has influenced my perspective on the whole charade. There was a sort of exhilaration for him to have the limit of his life made clear. He drove into the curve and he became sort of enlivened. What I witnessed was someone who made his dying <em>alive.</em></p><p><strong>Mortality and immortality, for you, are the same thing? </strong>None of us are getting out of here alive. It’s so banal to have to say this, but one does have to say it, because there’s so much denial around it. I’ve heard so many people who are living with a cancer that is going to take them away say that there is a vernacular around battle terminology: You’re a winner or you’re a loser. It’s all about fighting. It’s such a red herring, that attitude, because it brings with it the concept that we might win.</p><p><strong>It’s also as if somebody who “loses” didn’t fight hard enough. Which is an insult.</strong> But more than an insult — I agree with you it’s an insult — it’s a waste. Because that’s not the point of being alive. The point of being alive is that we know it’s limited, and there’s no magic, no rabbit up your sleeve that you can pull. I remember when I was beside my mother when she was dying. I found that borderline traumatic. The fact that there was nothing that could be done. I remember sitting there thinking, Is there no mortality police we can call?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>To stop it from happening? </strong>Just, like, this is barbaric, this death thing. Surely this is not right. I remember feeling that with childbirth as well: This is medieval — pre-medieval — torture. Can’t we have fixed it by now, this brutality?</p><p><strong>I’ve read you refer to feeling like a “foundling” as a child. I know you grew up in an aristocratic Scottish military family that could trace its ancestry back a thousand years. Why did you feel displaced?</strong> It’s so wonderful that you recount that back to me, David, because in the last few years, I have realized that was a complete ruse. I was systematically misled.</p><p><strong>Misled about what?</strong> About being an artist among such beings. I’ve realized since my parents died that there are artists scattered through my family. My great-grandmother was a singer who had a salon with Gabriel Fauré in London. She was a great singer of <em>lieder</em> in drawing rooms around Europe. She was a muse of John Singer Sargent. Her artistic eminence was underplayed by my parents, who were not artists, and I don’t think they quite understood it. They were, I think they’d forgive me for saying, rather frightened of artists.</p><p><strong>Initially you wanted to be a writer. From a young age you were writing poetry, and people were reading you. Then you got to Cambridge, intending to be a writer, and you stopped writing. What happened?</strong> It wasn’t that I wanted to be a writer; I <em>was</em> a writer. To a certain extent, David, and I have the nerve to say this to you, I still am. I find it difficult to describe myself as anything else. I certainly find it difficult to describe myself as an actor. For what it’s worth, and it’s worth a lot when you’re young, I won poetry competitions, and that’s why I wanted to go to university. I got my place, I’m embarrassed to say, at Cambridge, as a writer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p><strong>What was your poetry about?</strong> It was about nature, mainly. There was one, which was about a swan that I found on the river at home. That won, again it’s embarrassing to say, a poetry prize. I was quite a solitary child, and my writing was my company. It’s important that I stress that, because when I stopped writing — you ask why, we could have a whole master class on that.</p><p><strong>But why?</strong> Well, I could blame somebody. I could blame the program for inundating me with too much. I’m <em>not</em> going to blame somebody! That’s silly. I clearly didn’t have the confidence to hold my flame in that headwind of other voices. When I got to Cambridge, there was a lot of teaching, and there was a barrage of amazing noise, but I was like a tortoise: I just put my head in. And then I met friends. They just happened to be writers, but they were writing plays, and they said, “Come and be a part of this society.” So I started being in the plays to hang out with them. I was a performer by default, and very much led by the company, and that’s, frankly, all she wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Swinton in “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe” (2005).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Walt Disney, via Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p><strong>You know, when “The Room Next Door” was shown at the New York Film Festival, there was a post-screening talk </strong><strong><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/room-next-door-nyff-protest-1236108096/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interrupted</a></strong><strong> by pro-Palestinian protesters. You, gracefully in the moment, said in response that the protests were — I’m paraphrasing — uncomfortable but necessary and also relevant to the film, because Syria, Beirut and Gaza represent “the room next door,” and the film is asking people to be in that room and not look away. Is it your hope that people would have political connections spurred by seeing the film? </strong>I would like to make clear that I did include in that list of places Moscow and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. When it was reported afterward the names of those places were not mentioned. We have to be careful about that, because if I was making a point at all, the point I was making is that we are absolutely in the room next door to <em>everyone</em> all the time. And it was a very interesting moment, because those people who came to make a statement in that room, I believe, dignified that room. And it was of interest to me that Pedro [Almodóvar] and I, as Europeans, immediately offered them our microphones. That was apparently remarkable. It’s something to do with the fact that we’re brought up in unarmed societies. I talked to my American friends afterward, and it never occurred to me that somebody coming in with a banner might be armed. But that’s my privilege. Also, the idea of being frightened of free speech is something we have to take on. It’s also true, by the way, we didn’t hear what they wanted to say very well because they were masked. I would say to them, next time don’t mask yourselves. Say it clearly and own that presence, that statement, that gesture.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p><strong>This is a question I don’t know that I would have asked before Nov. 5 and Donald Trump’s election: You cut your teeth as an artist in the mid-80s, late ’80s, working with Derek Jarman making avant-garde queer cinema in Margaret Thatcher’s England — an extremely conservative time in that country. Is there anything you learned about being an artist in that cultural and political atmosphere that feels useful to you in this moment, when right-wing politics are again dominant? </strong>Yes. I left London in 1997 when my children were born and went to live in the north of Scotland. I never went back to London for years. But I happened to be there last autumn for a few weeks, and it was interesting, because both of my children at the time were living in London, and they were both 26, which was an age I was in London. So I was awash with nostalgia, and I was constantly making plans to meet up with my children, and I realized that every Saturday they were marching. And it struck me so deeply that that’s what I was doing when I was 26. Every Saturday we were marching for one thing or another, whether it was against the Iraq war, whether it was against <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/9/section/28/enacted" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 28</a>, which was the repressive bill.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Devin Oktar Yalkin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>Basically a homophobic bill. </strong>We campaigned long and hard against that. We were constantly in Trafalgar Square, and my children were, too. There was something in me that was grateful that they have this experience. Long live the opportunity to assemble freely and to protest, especially as a young person and especially as a young artist.</p><p><strong>But my question is more about the potential efficacy of art when it comes to protest and moving people’s politics. How much effect do you think art can have in that regard? </strong>Well, that brings me back to a question I asked you at the beginning of our conversation when you explained that you’d had these three experiences with the concept of death with dignity: the experience with your mother, the conversation with the doctor and then seeing a piece of art. I asked you a question, and we went up another alley. I’m asking it again: In terms of those three experiences, what did the art manage to do for you?</p><p><strong>There are feelings I have, and to see them reflected in the art or even tested against the art sort of tempers them with a flame. I walk away with the feelings more deeply held. But I’ve become skeptical that film or music or literature can do more than galvanize — that they can actually </strong><strong><em>change</em></strong><strong> feelings or precipitate a political idea that was not held in a person before. What’s your response to that? </strong>I suggest that art offers us an opportunity to be quiet and still and to allow, in that stillness, for a connection to form. So for example, sorry to use the example of your triptych of experiences around this material.</p><p><strong>Please. </strong>Your experience with your mother, not to be reductive, was lived. I don’t want to take any liberties here, but it’s such a car crash, that experience. One’s so in it, and one doesn’t know what one’s doing, but it’s happening and you’re just staying alive and surviving it. I’m sorry if that doesn’t sound representative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p><strong>I would say a slow-motion car crash. </strong>Slow-motion car crash. It’s so true. But point being, there’s nothing you can do. The actual lived experience is an encounter with helplessness and trying to survive it. How can I bear this helplessness? Then you do. And then your conversation with the doctor, I imagine, was intellectually stimulating. You were talking about ideas. And when you’re sitting in the dark and watching a film, here is an opportunity for you to look on something being played out in front of you. There’s levels of distance which are soothing to the nervous system. You’re able to observe, rather like in a meditation state. I think the superpower that art has is this distance it affords us, this capacity to be still and to allow resonances to arise from inside. And in the instance of your triptych experience, it’s a great palate cleanser: to go through a traumatic experience, to see it played out in the safe environment of a movie theater in the dark with strangers.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Swinton with the director Pedro Almodóvar and Julianne Moore on the set of “The Room Next Door” (2024).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Iglesias Más/El Deseo/Sony Pictures Classics</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>I don’t mean to belabor this — I’m probably just a grouch — but I used to really feel as if consuming art was sufficient when it came to forming a political identity and political engagement. Now I think I should have spent more time and energy out in the street and less time and energy in the theater or with headphones on. I’m rambling, but these are things I’ve been thinking about. </strong>I’m liking everything you’re saying, and I’m surfing the wave of it. It’s not a ramble at all. The real question is: Who are we and how must we live? I don’t necessarily want to designate one thing as political activism and another as artistic practice and another as living your life. For me, there ain’t no walls between any of them. Does that explain the attitude?</p><p><strong>The life came first. </strong>The life always comes first, and the work comes out of the life. Here’s another thing that I wanted to say: I was thinking about what we were talking about a beat before, about this resonance in the theater, that place of witness. This is a huge thing, this is a bombshell I’m going to lay down.</p><p><strong>Go for it. </strong>The thing I want to talk about is people’s innate goodness. I wonder whether art isn’t a call to our innate goodness — an opportunity to connect with the empathy machine that cinema is. That M&amp;M, Diet Coke place in the dark is an invitation to step into other people’s shoes. It’s such a massive gesture of <em>agape</em>, isn’t it? I wonder — I’m seeing you and raising you — about people’s innate goodness. Since you mentioned Nov. 5, and we’ve talked about the rise of the meanness of right-wing politics — let’s use a word that is appropriate here: meanness. What oil might get through that grease? How might one be able to reconnect with the innate goodness? I don’t want to assume that anybody else believes in innate goodness, but I’m declaring that I do. I do believe we were all little children, scared little animals once, including all of those people that we’re thinking about. I don’t know what happened to them to make them this mean, but we have to contact them somehow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>You raised the idea that art might be a call to our innate goodness. I have a hard time buying that. But I would like to be disabused of my skepticism. I just think there is so much art, even great art, that speaks to the worst of humanity. Look at Leni Riefenstahl’s films or the writing of Céline or a million other examples. I don’t see these as having anything to do with innate goodness. Maybe you could say that art allows us to tell the truth about humanity and show it in all its dimensions, but that’s not the same thing as goodness. Tell me I’m wrong. </strong>Can I just ask a question?</p><p><strong>Of course. </strong>Why do you have a gag reflex about the idea of innate goodness?</p><p><strong>Oh, I don’t. I think love is innately good. Life is innately good. But I find myself increasingly skeptical about the idea of art as being inherently positive. If we accept that art can be positive, I don’t understand how we could not accept that it can be negative. I think there’s something a little naïvely optimistic about the idea of art as innately good. </strong>I want to move the goal posts a bit. Maybe I’m conflating truth-telling and innate goodness. Let’s talk about Leni Riefenstahl. The fact that watching Leni Riefenstahl’s work and finding oneself stirred by it on any level, that is an opportunity for us to notice in ourselves the stirrings and the dangers of those stirrings and to, as you say, truthfully learn about ourselves that we are susceptible. That capacity to be honest about our own susceptibility is, I’m stretching it now, a good thing. We might be enriched by that perspective — we might become stronger and more socially responsible if we’re aware of our own vulnerabilities. Does that make any sense?</p><p><strong>It does make sense. You pointed to a meanness in the world, and suggested that the purveyors of that meanness were once vulnerable little children. </strong>Still are, whether they tell us or not.</p><p><strong>So having awareness of the meanness in the world and that the people who are mean are vulnerable little children — that could elicit what productive response? </strong>I suppose it’s about trying to not give up on the possibility of connection between people. There’s this tendency in the far right to encourage us to give up on human connection and entirely be self-serving. How do we go into some kind of negotiation with that? Do we just give up? They would love us to give up on trying to reach some kind of agreement. We just have to find agreements now. I can tell you, and he may even read this, if I ever met your incoming president, there is something I would love to talk to him about, which is having a Scottish mother. That’s something I can go toward him on.</p><p><strong>What would you want to talk to him about? </strong>I want to hear about <em>her</em>. I’m very curious about her. Aren’t you?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p><strong>I’m extremely curious.

It struck me that the way you talk about your development as an artist, and even your life, makes it sound contingent. You fell in with people, you met these writers. But there has to have been real intention in your life. At the risk of sounding as if I’m pumping you for self-help, what advice might you have for how to increase the possibility that someone could get the life they want? </strong>I’ll tell you a little something, and then we’ll figure out why I want to tell you it: In the church where my family would go on Sundays, our family has a separate loft which sits above everybody else and looks down. I remember sitting up there one Sunday and seeing the people that I had been playing with the day before and asking my mother why were we sitting upstairs and weren’t sitting downstairs. She could not come up with an answer. I noticed two things. First of all, my brothers didn’t ask this question. I love them, they’re sentient beings, but they did not ask that question. I was the only one. The other thing that I noticed since is that <em>no one</em> has ever come up with a good answer. The reason I tell you that story is that the quest for connection was always there in me. Connection is what I’m driven by, and I was lucky enough to notice it when I was sub-6. I can hold one idea, and <em>that’s</em> my idea. So here’s my answer to your question: Figuring out what your idea is, your factory setting, is probably a good place to start. Then, when you do find your original setting, honor it and enjoy the quest.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations.
