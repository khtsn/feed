Hegseth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-fight.html" title="">met this afternoon with senators whose voters could be crucial</a>.</p><p>One vote that lawmakers believe to be especially crucial is Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa. She is the Senate’s first female combat veteran and many Republican officials believe that without her approval, his chances for confirmation are as good as dead. After meeting with Hegseth yesterday, she said today that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/05/us/trump-news/senator-joni-ernst-holds-out-on-hegseth-as-his-candidacy-teeters?smid=url-share" title="">he had yet to earn her support</a>.</p><p>On Capitol Hill today, Hegseth dismissed questions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/pete-hegseth-workplace.html" title="">about his past conduct</a>, including allegations of sexual impropriety and mismanagement of his veterans nonprofits. He insisted he is now a different person, adding: “That’s a redemption story that I think a lot of Americans appreciate.”</p><p>Some people close to Trump suggested that there was a “less than 50 percent” chance that Hegseth will get confirmed, our politics reporter Jonathan Swan said. “Even as Donald Trump has insisted to Hegseth himself that he’s got his back, Trump has been very seriously entertaining the idea of replacing Hegseth,” Jonathan said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Caitlin Ochs for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-915b2fd">Police are chasing several leads in New York manhunt</h2><p>The authorities in New York City said they have not identified or located the man they believe fatally shot a health insurance executive in Midtown Manhattan yesterday. But they appeared today to be getting closer. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/05/nyregion/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-news" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>Two images were released by the police today that showed the face of the man they believe killed Brian Thompson, the head of UnitedHealthcare. A senior law enforcement official said that the man had used a fake New Jersey identification on Nov. 30 to book a room at a hostel on the Upper West Side.</p><p>The authorities also said they were investigating messages found on bullet casings at the scene of the shooting. The words on the casings include “delay” and “deny,” possible references to ways that health insurance companies seek to avoid paying patients’ claims. Thompson’s killing has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/social-media-insurance-industry-brian-thompson.html" title="">unleashed a torrent of criticism</a> of insurance companies, in particular the one he led, over claim denials.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Syrian antigovernment fighters on the streets of Hama today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abdulaziz Ketaz/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-1c58c5c3">Rebels stormed a major city in Syria</h2><p>Syrian rebels advanced today into the city of Hama, one of Syria’s largest cities, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-hama.html" title="">as government forces withdrew</a>.
