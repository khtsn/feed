    <h1>Milbank Is the Latest Law Firm to Reach a Deal With Trump</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Milbank recently hired <a href="https://www.milbank.com/en/professionals/neal-katyal.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neal Katyal,</a> a frequent critic of Mr. Trump who was an acting solicitor general during the Obama administration, as an attorney in its Washington office.</p><p>The settlement comes on the heals of similar deals Mr. Trump announced with two other big law firms: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-law-firm-doug-emhoff-wilkie-farr-gallagher.html" title="">Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher</a>. A number of big law firms have rushed to strike deals with the administration after Mr. Trump signed executive orders against three firms that crippled their ability to represent clients with government contracts or other government business.</p><p>Three firms are fighting the administration in court and federal judges have temporarily blocked the orders against them. But a big one, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, chose to settle after being hit with an executive order on March 14. The firm’s settlement has been roundly criticized by law professors and others in the legal industry. Critics said the firm’s decision would only embolden Mr. Trump to go after more firms he views as having helped his political enemies or causes he rejects.</p><p>In the statement posted on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said Milbank supported his initiative to end the “weaponization” of the legal system and to avoid partisan litigation. The president’s post included a statement from Scott Edelman, Milbank’s chairman, in which he said the firm was glad to be able to “find common ground” with Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Edelman did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, the New York City Bar issued a strong statement of support for the suits against the Trump administration. The country’s oldest attorney bar association said it supported the lawsuits filed by WilmerHale and Jenner &amp; Block and it affirmed the rights of lawyers to represent whomever they wanted.</p></div></div>
