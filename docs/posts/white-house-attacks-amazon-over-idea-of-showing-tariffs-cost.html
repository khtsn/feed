Temu primarily ships directly to consumers and has begun displaying “import charges” to reflect <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/trump-de-minimis-china-shipments.html" title="">the end of a customs loophole</a> that had exempted low-priced items from tariffs.</p><p>“Teams discuss ideas all the time,” the spokesman, Ty Rogers, said in a statement. He said it was never under consideration for the main Amazon site, adding: “This was never approved and is not going to happen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Standing beside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a briefing at the White House on Tuesday morning, Ms. Leavitt tore into the retailer. She said that she had just been on the phone with the president about the report, and she asked why Amazon hadn’t done such a thing when prices increased during the Biden administration because of inflation.</p><p>Ms. Leavitt said it was “not a surprise” coming from Amazon, as she held up a copy of a 2021 article from Reuters with the headline, “Amazon partnered with China propaganda arm.” </p><p>Mr. Trump’s aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods have touched off an escalating trade war, even as his administration has backed off its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/economy/trump-tariff-timeline.html" title="">broader global levies</a> amid what it said were negotiations with dozens of nations on new trade deals.</p><p>Ms. Leavitt’s attack on Amazon was all the more noteworthy because the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has lately gone to great lengths to curry favor with this White House. Amazon donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural fund, securing seats for Mr. Bezos and his bride-to-be in the Capitol Rotunda for the inauguration.</p><p>In December, Mr. Bezos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/jeff-bezos-trump-amazon-washington-post.html" title="">explained</a> his Trump-ward turn while speaking at The New York Times DealBook conference. “What I’ve seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time,” Mr. Bezos said of Mr. Trump, “more confident, more settled.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He added, “I’m very hopeful. He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation.”</p><p>Ms. Leavitt was asked whether the White House still considered Mr. Bezos to be a Trump supporter, given the latest report.</p><p>“Look, I will not speak to the president’s relationships with Jeff Bezos,” Ms. Leavitt said, “but I will tell you that this is certainly a hostile and political action by Amazon.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shawn McCreesh is a White House reporter for The Times covering the Trump administration.</p></div><div><p>Karen Weise writes about technology for The Times and is based in Seattle.
