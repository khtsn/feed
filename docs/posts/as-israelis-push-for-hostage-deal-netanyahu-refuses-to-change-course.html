And the day ended with a defiant speech from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which he refused to compromise in the negotiations with Hamas and implicitly rebuked the protesters for straining Israel’s social cohesion.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/01/world/hostages-strike-israel-gaza-war" title="">one of the biggest displays of wartime dissent</a> in Israel’s history, an emotionally potent moment failed to evolve into a political turning point.</p><p>“Politically, it could have been much worse for Netanyahu,” said Ariel Kahana, a commentator for Israel Hayom, a leading right-wing newspaper. “It looks like the opposition has lost,” Mr. Kahana added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While the strike slowed or suspended services at thousands of schools and several municipalities, transport networks and hospitals, some sectors were only partly affected. Many municipal authorities and institutions declined to take part.</p><p>Unlike in March 2023, when a general strike and mass protests prompted Mr. Netanyahu to suspend a contentious plan to overhaul the judiciary, this time his right-wing party maintained the public unity it has displayed throughout the war. Only Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, voted against a recent cabinet motion to restrict the circumstances in which Israel could agree to a cease-fire, and few, if any, other senior officials from his party, Likud, have broken ranks in public.</p><p>“The first condition for victory in this existential war is internal unity,” Mr. Netanyahu said in his speech on Monday night, even as more protesters tried to break through police lines near his private residence in Jerusalem. “We need to stand together as one against a cruel enemy that wants to destroy us all, each and every one,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel during a news conference in Jerusalem on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Ohad Zwigenberg</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The defiance from Mr. Netanyahu and dissent from his critics reflected the growing schism within Israel about the country’s immediate priorities.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The protesters want the government to compromise and agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal even if it allows Hamas to survive the war. The government and its supporters want to hold out for a deal that will make it easier for the Israeli military to continue fighting Hamas after a short truce — even if playing hardball delays the release of the hostages and more to die in captivity.</p><p>The protesters were particularly incensed by the announcement on Sunday that the Israeli military had discovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages who were previously thought to be alive, and who the military said had recently been killed by Hamas. The government’s critics said that most if not all of them could have been saved if Mr. Netanyahu had agreed to a truce.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/middleeast/hersh-goldberg-polin-funeral-israel-hostage.html?smid=url-share" title="">Funerals for some of the slain hostages</a> took place on Monday afternoon in the presence of vast crowds of mourners.</p><p>“I really hope that this is a turning point,” said Gil Dickmann, a cousin of one of the hostages buried on Monday, Carmel Gat. Speaking at a news briefing hours before the funeral, Mr. Dickmann agreed that it was important for Israel to destroy Hamas, but said that the hostages must be freed first. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Act now and sign this deal,” Mr. Dickmann said. “We must save lives before it’s too late.”</p><p>By nightfall, Mr. Dickmann’s demand had gone unmet, as the prime minister doubled down on his refusal to withdraw from strategic areas of Gaza, a core Hamas demand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners at the funeral for Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of six hostages whose bodies were retrieved from Gaza, in Jerusalem on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In part, Mr. Netanyahu remained unswayed because the protesters were not drawn from his right-wing base, meaning that he faces little political cost for ignoring them, analysts said.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu&#39;s right-wing supporters largely accept his argument for driving a hard bargain with Hamas. In fact, the strike and protests are likely to boost Mr. Netanyahu in the eyes of right-wing Israelis, because they feel he is being criticized in bad faith, according to Nadav Shtrauchler, a political analyst and former strategist for Mr. Netanyahu.</p><p>“His supporters see this strike as a prize for terror,” Mr. Shtrauchler said. “For many people on the right wing, it’s not reasonable,” Mr. Shtrauchler added. </p><p>After Mr. Netanyahu rejected the protesters’ demands on Monday night, a firebrand Likud lawmaker, Tally Gotliv, exemplified the buoyant mood of his base. “This is how you do it!” Ms. Gottliv wrote on social media. “Mr. Prime Minister, a demonstration of control and leadership.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 2023, it was increasingly vocal unease from a handful members of Likud’s moderate wing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/14/world/middleeast/israel-judicial-overhaul-strikes.html" title="">helped persuade Mr. Netanyahu to slow the pace of his judicial overhaul</a>.</p><p>Now, there is less internal opposition. Mr. Gallant, the defense minister, was the sole cabinet member who voted against a motion last week that prevents Israel from agreeing to withdraw from Gaza as part of a cease-fire deal, a decision that makes a deal less likely. And Mr. Gallant was again a lone voice on Sunday, as he called on the cabinet to reverse its decision.</p><p>“No one in Likud is saying: We’re going to bring you down,” said Mr. Shtrauchler. “The only opposition is from Gallant.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters in Tel Aviv yesterday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Some political moderates may have been put off by the accusatory tone of the protests and strikes, Mr. Kahana said.

But at the same time we want our security,” said Mr. Kahana, who shares Mr. Netanyahu’s wariness of a hasty truce. “The disagreement is about how to bring them home.”</p><p>Others may have avoided joining the strike because they feel that the social unrest throughout the first nine months of 2023 made Israel more vulnerable to Hamas’s attack last October.</p><p>Israelis of all backgrounds agree that the 2023 domestic unrest weakened Israel in the eyes of its enemies. The fear of creating a similar impression likely dented support for the protests among some Israelis, Mr. Kahana said.</p><p>“One of the main lessons for mainstream Israelis from 2023 was that we must keep our unity,” he said.</p><p>Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/03/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-hostages-protests.html">268</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Netanyahu Digs In:</strong><strong> </strong>In his first news conference since the bodies of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/hostages-gaza-what-to-know.html">six killed hostages</a> were recovered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gaza-war-protests-hostages.html">refused to budge on his conditions for any truce in Gaza</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden’s Terse Rebuke:</strong><strong> </strong>President Biden, when asked whether Netanyahu was doing enough to secure a deal to free hostages in Gaza, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/middleeast/biden-netanyahu-hostage-ceasefire-deal-israel.html">responded simply: “No.”</a></p></li><li><p><strong>The Hostages Still in Gaza:</strong><strong> </strong>Dozens of hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel remain in captivity, according to the Israeli authorities. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/world/middleeast/hostages-in-gaza-hamas.html">Here is what we know about them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gaza’s Polio Crisis:</strong><strong> </strong>The W.H.O. said that the campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza against polio had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/world/middleeast/polio-vaccinations-gaza-who.html">so far been more successful than expected</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hamas’s Tunnel Strategy:</strong><strong> </strong>Hamas leaders spent years developing an underground warfare plan in Gaza. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/europe/hamas-tunnels-war-documents.html">Records from the battlefield show the group’s preparations</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
