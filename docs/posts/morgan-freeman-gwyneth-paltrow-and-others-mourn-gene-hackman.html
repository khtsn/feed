title="">dead on Wednesday at the age of 95</a> at his home in Santa Fe, N.M., with his wife and one of their dogs, streamed in from collaborators and co-stars as the news spread.</p><p>Hackman, who played flawed Everymen, inflexible patriarchs and inspirational mentors, had decades of notable roles, prompting generations of mourners to remember their time working with the actor.</p><h2 id="link-4c468af1">Francis Ford Coppola</h2><p>Coppola, who directed Hackman in the 1974 neo-noir “The Conversation,” in which the actor played a wiretapping expert enmeshed in paranoia, posted a photo of them <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGkjPLMxrl8/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the set together</a>.</p><p>“The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration: Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity,” Coppola wrote in the caption. “I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-65e2efc3">Morgan Freeman</h2><p>Freeman, who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 neo-western “Unforgiven,” which won best picture and best supporting actor for Hackman at the Academy Awards, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGlUpZbTAnf/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a picture</a> of them from a later collaboration with Monica Bellucci. In the caption, he said working with Hackman on that movie, “Under Suspicion,” from 2000, was “one of the personal highlights of my career.”</p><h2 id="link-10028714">Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><p>Paltrow, who played the daughter to Hackman’s eccentric patriarch in Wes Anderson’s 2001 dramedy “The Royal Tenenbaums,” posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGlVPplPzsq/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a cropped image of that movie’s cast</a> that centered her, Luke Wilson and Hackman. She captioned it only with an emoji of a broken heart.</p><h2 id="link-50796d0c">Barry Sonnenfeld</h2><p>Sonnenfeld <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGlSH-NJsH3/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a still from “Get Shorty,”</a> the 1995 gangster comedy he directed in which Hackman played a B-movie director with a large gambling debt who was chased down by a mobbed-up loan shark played by John Travolta.</p><p>“He was brilliant, hilarious and always real,” Sonnenfeld wrote in the caption. “And always knew his lines. Couldn’t ask for more from an actor.”</p><h2 id="link-6945366e">Nathan Lane</h2><p>Lane, one of Hackman’s co-stars in the 1996 queer farce comedy “The Birdcage,” said in a statement that he thought he told Hackman he was his favorite actor every day during filming. He also praised Hackman’s range in both comedy and drama, saying it was a privilege to share the screen with him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Getting to watch him up close, it was easy to see why he was one of our greatest,” Lane said in the statement, reported by Variety and People magazine. “You could never catch him acting. Simple and true, thoughtful and soulful, with just a hint of danger.”</p><h2 id="link-66aacbe0">Hank Azaria</h2><p>Azaria, who played the Guatemalan housekeeper and aspiring drag queen Agador Spartacus in “The Birdcage,” posted <a href="https://x.com/HankAzaria/status/1895142180437553540" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stills from that movie</a> with him and Hackman, who played an ultraconservative Republican senator meeting the gay parents of his future son-in-law.</p><p>“It was an honor and an education working with Gene Hackman,” Azaria wrote. “Mike Nichols said of his genius character acting: ‘He always brought just enough of a different part of the real gene to each role he played.’”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Aguiar is a reporter covering arts and culture and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/annie-aguiar">More about Annie Aguiar</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/nathan-lane">Nathan Lane</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/francis-ford-coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/hank-azaria">Hank Azaria</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/morgan-freeman">Morgan Freeman</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="NYT_BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" data-testid="region"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="push-what-to-watch" data-id="100000007731011" data-source-id="100000007731011"><div><!--
