Some have also become accustomed to conservative activists hunting for examples of rare fraud — an edgy new normal for the country’s democratic process.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Four years ago, voting seemed relatively smooth on Election Day as well, only to be followed by eruptions of menacing protest and former President Donald J. Trump’s false claims of victory, which mounted as counting continued for days.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voters cast their ballots at the National WWI Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Mo., on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Robert Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nevada residents voted at a polling location in a recreational center in Las Vegas on Tuesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Gale for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This year, too, some of Mr. Trump’s supporters have been primed to see fraud in the normal process of administering elections, and the day saw a stream of false allegations of election malfeasance on social media as well as bold predictions that Mr. Trump had already won the election.</p><p>In that environment, small issues swiftly became inflated. In Cambria County, Pa., a rural red county east of Pittsburgh, machines were unable to scan voters ballots in the morning. The issue was eventually resolved, and a court ordered polling locations throughout the county to remain open two extra hours, until 10 p.m. tonight.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Trump supporters on Elon Musk’s social network, X, suggested the problems were part of plot to disenfranchise voters in a county that heavily favored Mr. Trump four years ago.</p><p>The very present threat that Mr. Trump would try to overturn the results again added to the anxiety being expressed by voters at polling locations throughout swing states, many now equipped with panic buttons and police officers stationed outside.</p><p>Eleanor Boyle, 77, from Warminster Township in Bucks County, Pa., said that while she had faith in Pennsylvania and national elections, the voting had left her anxious and unsettled. She fears Trump supporters will not accept a loss; she watched the Jan. 6 chaos at the Capitol in horror.</p><p>“I’m very worried that there could be violence throughout the whole country, not just the Capitol,” Ms. Boyle, who goes by Bunny, said. When she mentioned to her sewing group that she planned to volunteer at the polls, “people asked if I was afraid — even here, in Warminster.”</p><p>Officials were prepared. As District Attorney Larry Krasner of Philadelphia put it while warning those who might make trouble at polling stations, “F around and find out.” Yet the message did nothing to stop partisan polling observers from seeking to copy down serial numbers from the backs of voting machines at a Southwest Philadelphia precinct, leading to those people’s <a href="https://whyy.org/live/election-2024-pennsylvania-live-updates-new-jersey-delaware/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporary expulsion</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>And, in Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a press briefing that he had a message to Russia regarding the bomb threats: “We’re not going to be intimidated.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election judges at a polling station at a church in Aurora, Colo. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Woolf for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Customized “I Voted” stickers in West Memphis, Ark.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brad J.

For instance, a report that conservative activists had “intimidated” voters outside a polling station in Lee County, N.C., amounted to an overheard, harsh comment directed at Latino voting rights group at the same polling station.</p><p>Dana Nessel, the Democratic attorney general of Michigan, said that voting had gone largely smoothly in her state on Tuesday, as it was to be expected; she recalled that Election Day in Michigan in 2020 was largely calm, and it was not until the counting process began that disputes broke out. This year, she said, poll workers, election officials and law enforcement are ready for it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“The important thing for me to let people know is that there’s going to be accountability.”</p><p>Even after casting his own vote in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump denigrated the election system while speaking with reporters, questioning the functionality of voting machines and repeating his calls for a return to paper ballots. Again, he said he appeared to be winning, but also indicated that he would not prematurely declare victory as he did overnight four years ago — as some trusted advisers, including the conservative provocateur Stephen K. Bannon, have urged him to do again.</p><p>“If I lose an election, if it’s a fair election, I’m going to be the first one to acknowledge it,” he said, “and I think it’s — well, so far, I think it’s been fair.”</p><p><em>Sharon LaFraniere, JoAnna Daemmrich and Mattathias Schwartz contributed reporting.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Rutenberg is a writer at large for The Times and The New York Times Magazine and writes most often about media and politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-rutenberg">More about Jim Rutenberg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
