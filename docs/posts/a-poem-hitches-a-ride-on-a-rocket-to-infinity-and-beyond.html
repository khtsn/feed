Then there was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/06/books/ada-limon-poetry.html" title="">Ada Limón</a>, the 24th Poet Laureate of the United States, whose 150-word poem is engraved on an interior panel that’s roughly the size of a three-ring binder.</p><p>“At first you don’t hear anything,” Limón said of a view that went from bucolic to chaotic to astonishing in the time it takes a cloud to skid across the sun. “You see the explosion, then it hits you. It feels like a physical representation of the amount of work it takes to make a mission like this occur.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-1"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In May, NASA technicians installed the vault plate engraved with “In Praise of Mystery.”<br/></span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Limón’s poem appears on an interior panel in her own handwriting.<br/></span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Limón’s contribution, “In Praise of Mystery,” is a tiny piece of a complicated puzzle that has the potential to change humanity’s understanding of its place in the solar system. It isn’t the first <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/exploring-space-and-poetry-during-national-poetry-month/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poem to slip the surly bonds of Earth</a> and it won’t be the last. But its origin story is a reminder of the link between art and science, and the way inspiration flows in both directions.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The collaboration started with an email from one government agency to another.</p><p>On Oct. 14, 2022, Bert Ulrich, NASA’s liaison for multimedia collaborations, sent a message to Brett Zongker, chief of media relations at the Library of Congress, asking if Limón would be interested in writing a poem to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/science/nasa-europa-clipper-jupiter.html#:~:text=Europa%20Clipper%2C%20the%20biggest%20interplanetary,else%20in%20our%20solar%20system%3F" title="">travel aboard Europa Clipper</a>.</p><p>Over the course of five and a half years, the probe will travel 1.8 billion miles to Europa, Jupiter’s second moon, where it will conduct 49 flybys in order to determine whether the watery landscape there might be conducive to life. The Clipper team wanted to send earthling signatures along for the ride, and they hoped Limón might be able to dream up a message from, well, humanity.</p><p>Limón was up for the challenge. She’s been writing about constellations and the moon since she was a kid pondering the heavens in Sonoma County, Calif. She already had six books and a National Book Award nomination under her belt. She loves Star Trek and voyages of all stripes.</p><p>After all, Limón said,“Poetry is the language of mystery and the unknown.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25limon-05-zmlc/25limon-05-zmlc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25limon-05-zmlc/25limon-05-zmlc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25limon-05-zmlc/25limon-05-zmlc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="This picture shows Ada Limón gazing at the launch site for Europa Clipper, with the large digital countdown clock visible in the background." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25limon-05-zmlc/25limon-05-zmlc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25limon-05-zmlc/25limon-05-zmlc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25limon-05-zmlc/25limon-05-zmlc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 792w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/25/multimedia/25limon-05-zmlc/25limon-05-zmlc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1583w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/383ac7c4-728f-56b6-896e-b329b9914c7b" decoding="async" width="600" height="776"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Limón said, “We’re in space.

This poem was due in three months, give or take. The text had to be under 200 words. Ideally it would contain water imagery, and it needed to be accessible to people on a fourth grade reading level.</p><p>Ever the diligent student, Limón immersed herself in a trove of documents and scientific facts provided by NASA. These were meant to be helpful, but they had the opposite effect: Limón became so hellbent on including certain details — Europa’s thick icy crust, for instance — she quickly lost her way.</p><p>“It was failure after failure after failure,” she said. “Over and over and over again.”</p><p>Poetry isn’t like eggs made to order, of course. It’s hard to cook up a collection of words for a specific palate; the process is more alchemy than science.</p><p>Eventually, Limón husband, Lucas Marquardt, told her, “‘You need to stop writing a NASA poem and start writing a poem you would actually write.”</p><p>The point was to deliver a message, not a lesson, she realized.</p><p>“That was where the poem took off,” Limón said. “I wanted to make sure it was a poem of praise and wonder.
