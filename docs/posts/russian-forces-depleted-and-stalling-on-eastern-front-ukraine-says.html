Mr. Zelensky said the meeting will be held Tuesday in Saudi Arabia and the State Department says Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be part of those talks. (Mr. Zelensky also <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1898361925807018492" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he would meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.)</p><p>Western military analysts and U.S. officials believe that the order to hold back equipment is likely to take several months to have a significant impact on the front. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/us/politics/cia-director-ukraine-intelligence.html" title="">the loss of intelligence</a> is already hurting Ukraine’s ability to strike Russian command centers, logistics hubs and concentrations of troops behind the front lines.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers said the lack of intelligence was especially problematic in the Kursk region of Russia, where Russian and North Korean soldiers are on the offensive and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-north-korea-kursk.html" title="">rapidly advanced</a>.
