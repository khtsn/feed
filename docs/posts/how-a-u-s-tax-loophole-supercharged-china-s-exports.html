First on platforms like eBay and Amazon, and then on apps like Shein and Temu, exporters funneled the products of China’s vast manufacturing supply chain straight to doorsteps in the United States.</p><p>This single policy change in 2016 helped transform the economic relationship between the two countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>While the United States has received factory goods from China for decades, and China’s manufacturing efficiency has loaded the supply chains of American businesses, the expanded tariff-free loophole got American shoppers hooked on buying their exercise clothes and household gadgets online at rock-bottom prices. And in China, millions found work in factories that sold goods on e-commerce marketplaces — not just China’s own, like Shein, Temu and TikTok, but also Amazon and Walmart.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Merchandise in Guangzhou.

Some four million packages a day entered the United States last year with no customs inspection and no duties paid.</p><p>That changed on Friday, when the latest measure unraveling trade between the world’s two largest economies took effect. Most packages from mainland China and Hong Kong are now subject to tariffs even if they are worth less than $800.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>People in both countries are already feeling the change. American shoppers are seeing higher prices when they check out on their phones, and Chinese exporters are scrambling to find buyers outside the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some factories in southern China, where much of this manufacturing is centered, have suspended operations since the beginning of April, raising concerns that laborers will be put out of work.</p><p>Zhang Yikui, who sews clothes that sell on Shein and Amazon at a factory in Guangzhou, the hub of China’s garment industry, said his factory used to make 100,000 pieces a month. Now orders are down to around 60,000, Mr. Zhang said on Thursday. He and about 40 colleagues, surrounded by piles of Shein bags, were sewing denim dresses.</p><p>Mr. Zhang was resolute that they would find buyers. “People in other countries still need to wear clothes,” he said. “And in the United States, they don’t make this kind of thing at all.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deliveries in Guangzhou.

In April, while President Trump ratcheted up tariffs to 145 percent for more than half of China’s exports to the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/china-pmi-factory-manufacturing.html" title="">new orders for export</a> sank to their lowest level since the end of 2022, according to official data released this week.</p><p>Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, a Japanese bank, said in a note to investors this week that almost six million people in China could lose their jobs in the near term because of the tariffs, and as many as 16 million in the long run.</p><p>The Chinese government has struggled to wean the country off its decades-long dependence on real estate. The collapse of the real estate market, where most Chinese households build their wealth, propelled a sharp decline in prices and left consumers reluctant to spend.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Packages in the garment district. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>China’s cross-border e-commerce industry, with thousands of factories as its lifeblood, has been one of the few bright spots.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The rise of marketplace platforms like Amazon and Shein, which was founded over a decade ago, coincided with a push by the Chinese government for small businesses to do more to reach overseas markets.</p><p>The apps acted like a funnel for the huge variety of goods made in Chinese factories. They enabled Chinese businesses to send packages directly to shoppers, allowing them to move inventory swiftly in response to buying trends, and made it possible for even small factories in China to be global businesses, said Moira Weigel, a Harvard professor writing a book about online marketplaces.</p><p>All this was made even easier in 2016. The thinking in Congress was that raising the tax-free limit to $800 would give consumers and small businesses more access to cheap goods from overseas, and that other countries would respond by opening their markets more to American goods, spurring U.S. exports. But the United States remained an outlier among its main trading partners. China’s threshold for tax-free imports is $7.</p><p>For nearly a century, federal law has carved out inexpensive goods, known as de minimis imports, from import taxes. The threshold, which had stood at $1 for decades, was raised to $5 in 1978 and $200 in 1993.</p><p>The bump to $800 opened the floodgate, and China has been by far the biggest exporter of de minimis goods. In 2018, Chinese companies exported about $5 billion in single packages, with an average value of $54. By 2023, that total had soared to $66 billion, according to data from the Congressional Research Service.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The trade tensions, and the end of the tax-free policy in the United States, threaten to bring all this to a grinding halt.</p><p>Han Dongfang, founder at China Labor Bulletin, which tracks protests over factory closures in China, warned that the impact of the tariffs could be “way worse” than the pandemic for the country’s workers.</p><p>Some factories have turned to e-commerce platforms in Europe and Southeast Asia in search of new markets for their products. E-commerce consultants in China are offering tutorials to help businesses sell their goods on eBay in Japan or Amazon in Brazil.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some factories in southern China have shut down since April, raising fears of job losses.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Other Chinese sellers tried to stockpile goods in the United States.

But that could prove difficult if more people are unemployed, said Qiu Dongxiao, head of the economics department at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.</p><p>“Even those people who have jobs right now are very cautious when they spend money because they are not sure whether they will still have their jobs tomorrow,” Mr. Qiu said.</p><p>Siyi Zhao<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/shein-fashion-label">Shein (Fashion Label)</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Trump’s Tariffs</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Small Online Sellers Scramble:</strong> Independent vendors who sell on sites like Etsy and eBay are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/business/trump-tariffs-china-online-sellers.html">trying to blunt the pain from tariffs</a> on low-cost Chinese-made goods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meta Anticipates Continued Growth:</strong> The Silicon Valley company made the revenue projection as it reported a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/technology/meta-earnings-report.html">35 percent rise in profit</a> in the first quarter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Senate Rejects Measure to Undo Tariffs:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/senate-trump-tariffs.html">Only three Republicans joined Democrats</a> in voting to end the national emergency Trump declared to impose tariffs on most U.S. trading partners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Japan Slashes Growth Forecast:</strong> The Bank of Japan predicted growth of just 0.5 percent, cutting its previous forecast in half, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/bank-of-japan-gdp-forecast.html">decided against another hike in interest rates</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> Fearing Toy Shortages:</strong> Toy makers, children’s shops and specialty retailers are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/trump-tariffs-christmas-china.html">pausing orders for the winter holidays</a> as the import taxes cascade through supply chains.
