The worst fallout is still in western North Carolina, where, in addition to the mass wreckage of destroyed buildings, teams are searching for dozens of missing people, some areas have no potable water, cellphone communication remains spotty, more than 170,000 customers still don’t have power, and hundreds of roads are closed. </p><p>But at least five other states are grappling with their own intractable problems from impassable highways to ruined farmland.</p><p>President Biden, who surveyed the storm’s toll this week, said Helene most likely caused billions of dollars in damage, and he asked Congress on Friday to quickly replenish disaster relief funds to help. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here are some of the biggest current issues in the Southeast:</p><h2 id="link-4fd40bf8">In North Carolina, an untold number of people are still missing.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The remains of a home in Swannanoa, N.C.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Loren Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the western part of the state, many families’ greatest concern is their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/hurricane-helene-missing-people.html" title="">unaccounted loved ones</a>. But looking for them in mountain-ringed towns and rugged ravines has been a daunting task for search teams, and the effort has been hampered by poor cell service and widespread power losses.</p><p>It is unclear exactly how many are still missing. The Asheville police said it had located 270 unaccounted people by Friday evening. But 75 additional cases of missing people remain active, and the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security were called in to help. Other problems, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/helene-north-carolina-latino-swannanoa.html" title="">delayed aid</a> to non-English speaking communities, also continue to challenge<span>  </span>recovery efforts. </p><p>Beyond that, however, simply getting access to basic needs is still a struggle for thousands. Residents in Asheville have been forced to travel elsewhere, if possible, for water so they can wash their clothes, take showers and flush their toilets. </p><p>Many people in western North Carolina still have not been able to get consistent cellphone reception, if they get any at all. In Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, 40 percent of its 347 cellular towers were not working on Friday, according to the Federal Communications Commission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Transportation officials say that repairing the roads — particularly around the North Carolina-Tennessee border — may take months.

In Taylor County, where Helene made landfall, the storm caused about <a href="https://www.wptv.com/weather/hurricane/once-a-day-i-break-down-and-cry-big-bend-residents-still-recovering-week-after-hurricane-helene" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$50 million in damages</a> and destroyed or rendered uninhabitable at least 250 homes on the coastline, said John Louk, the director of emergency management for the county. </p><p>Hundreds of miles south, nearly <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/281223bb985542829ad8f21eb7e3d6c5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">17,000 homes</a> in Pinellas County are ruined or have major damages. The densely populated Tampa Bay region saw record-breaking storm surge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Many families still have no long-term shelter plans, though Gov. Ron DeSantis has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/MP7ZqTPY2bYP2ptj/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that people who are still recovering and rebuilding may apply for a travel trailer.</p><h2 id="link-12c3b6e9">Georgia’s crucial farming industry is in shambles.</h2><p>Agricultural officials are still assessing the scale of losses<strong> </strong>after Helene decimated crops and farm buildings in eastern Georgia, exacting what officials called “catastrophic” damage in the state’s oldest and largest industry. An $83 billion sector, agriculture employs more than 320,000 people in Georgia.</p><p>No part of this vital industry was spared by Helene, Gov. Brian Kemp said at a Friday news conference. </p><p>A third of the cotton crop and up to 30 percent of the peanut crop were wrecked. More than 220 poultry houses were demolished, and hundreds more suffered damages. At least 48,000 acres of pecans were ruined.</p><p>It is a rough start to the fall harvest for local farmers, who also had to rebound after Hurricane Michael in 2018 inflicted <a href="https://news.uga.edu/georgia-farmers-face-more-than-2b-in-losses-from-hurricane-michael/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2 billion</a> in agricultural losses. State officials are racing to secure emergency relief before farm operators — who have already been reeling from inflation and low commodity prices — begin to collapse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-30146888">Some South Carolinians may not have power for weeks.</h2><p>Service crews in South Carolina are making swift progress on fixing electric outages across the state, bringing down the number of customers without power to <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/south%20carolina" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under 158,000</a> as of Saturday afternoon from more than 3 million shortly after Helene arrived. But the problems are rampant<strong> </strong>for homes and businesses near the state’s western edges.</p><p>In Aiken County, which sits on the border with Georgia and has some 170,000 residents, a third of the power remained out on Friday afternoon, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Nearby in Edgefield County, more than half of all outages still needed repairs.</p><p>Helene toppled power lines above ground. But a local utility company said on social media that engineers were discovering the damage lies far beyond “what meets the eye.” Many underground cables are flooded beyond repair, and power transformers are crushed from debris.</p><h2 id="link-4bb2ebea">Eastern Tennessee faces painful questions over deaths at a factory.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Impact Plastics in Erwin, Tenn., several workers were swept away and died during the storm.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christian Monterrosa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>After at least 13 people in Tennessee died in the storm, state investigators are probing complaints out of a factory where some lost their lives. At Impact Plastics in Erwin, it is believed that about 11 employees, some of them immigrants, were swept away by floodwaters. At least three workers were found lifeless, and three others remain missing, immigrant advocates said.<span>  </span></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But some surviving workers say the company had told the employees not to leave and were not given evacuation instructions, according to the advocates. </p><p>The company has <a href="https://newschannel9.com/resources/pdf/d66f795b-4685-42e9-8675-68ed51ddb30d-ImpactPlasticsNewsRelease.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied</a> fault.

More than 900 homes, for example, were damaged in six counties, <a href="https://x.com/TennesseeEMA/status/1841899705204129843?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state officials said</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage in Carter County, Tenn., near the border with North Carolina.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Loren Elliott for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-127968b1">Major highways in Virginia are critically damaged.</h2><p>Helene was Virginia’s most significant disaster since Hurricane Irene in 2011, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/us/29hurricane.html" title="">2.5 million people</a> across the commonwealth experienced power failures, officials said.

One of the closed highways is Route 58, a main thoroughfare that skims the state’s borders with North Carolina and Tennessee and contains a 1.5-mile stretch that is “absolutely impassable,” according to the governor.</p><p>State leaders are rushing to create a plan to reopen the highways, along with another 52 roads in the region whose closures have left many rural communities isolated.</p><p>Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs<!-- -->, <!-- -->Emily Cochrane<!-- --> and <!-- -->Edgar Sandoval<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
