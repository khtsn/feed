Almost as soon as the Oct. 7 attack happened, Israeli leaders vowed to hold Sinwar accountable. So long as he was still directing Hamas’s operations from the tunnels of Gaza, Israel could not credibly claim to have achieved its goals.</p><p>Now Sinwar is dead, killed Wednesday in a firefight with Israeli troops who unexpectedly encountered him in southern Gaza. The troops, backed by drones, came upon a small group of Hamas fighters and brought down part of a building where they had taken cover. The Israeli troops found Sinwar’s body in the rubble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But the larger significance of Sinwar’s death — for Israel, Hamas, Gaza and the Middle East — remains unclear. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain both why his death could be a turning point and why it might not be. I will also walk you through The Times’s extensive coverage.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2e0333e1">Reasons for a deal</h2><p>In a span of three months, Israel has killed three top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, two Iran-backed militant groups that have been fighting Israel for decades. In July, a bomb placed in a government guesthouse in Tehran killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political leader. Three weeks ago, Israeli planes bombed a Hezbollah office in Beirut, killing its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. “The optics is that of an edifice collapsing,” Hassan Hassan of New Lines Magazine wrote yesterday, referring to Iran’s network of groups known as the axis of resistance.</p><p>That apparent collapse offers Israel a chance to declare victory, especially against Hamas in Gaza, and negotiate peace terms. Many political leaders in other countries, including President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, hope for this outcome. “Now, after Mr. Sinwar’s killing, a route toward some kind of truce in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/hamas-leader-sinwar-ceasefire-talks.html" title="">seems slightly more navigable</a>,” Patrick Kingsley, The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, wrote.</p><p>Patrick noted that a major sticking point had been Sinwar’s insistence on a permanent peace deal that would leave Hamas in power; Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, refused any agreement that let Hamas survive. With Sinwar gone, a deal could involve the release of the Israeli, American and other hostages held by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The end of fighting could also alleviate the intense suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and allow for the beginning of reconstruction efforts, funded by Arab countries and overseen by Palestinian groups that are more moderate than Hamas.</p><h2 id="link-56d31b67">Reasons for no deal</h2><p>Yet it remains unclear whether either Netanyahu or Hamas’s surviving leadership is ready for a truce.</p><p>Hamas has survived the deaths of previous leaders and has emerged with a new generation willing to die in the service of trying to destroy Israel. (This Times article explains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/hamas-leadership-sinwar-death.html" title="">what we know about Hamas’s remaining leaders</a>.) A basic tension remains: Israel is unwilling to accept a Gaza where Hamas retains power; Hamas’s leaders are unwilling to surrender.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“For the sake of their own physical survival, they may make more compromises than the man who initiated the whole war,” Ibrahim Dalalsha, director of the Horizon Center, a research group in the West Bank, told The Times. But, he added, “they won’t say: ‘Yes, we’ll do whatever you want, Mr. Netanyahu.’”</p><p>For Netanyahu, a peace deal also brings political risks. He has long opposed a Palestinian state, as have the far-right parties in his governing coalition. Both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, among other countries, favor a two-state solution and have said any peace deal must include steps toward a Palestinian state. Agreeing to those steps could unravel Netanyahu’s coalition, either costing him his job or forcing him to make an alliance with more centrist parties.</p><p>“A lot of people seem hopeful that Netanyahu will use Sinwar’s killing as an opportunity to declare victory, negotiate a hostage deal and end the war,” Gregg Carlstrom, a Middle East correspondent for The Economist, wrote. “But to believe that you basically have to ignore everything Netanyahu has said and done over the past year.”</p><p>Perhaps the biggest question is whether Sinwar’s death is big enough of a development to change the political dynamics in both Israel and Gaza.</p><h2 id="link-fb06cb4">From Times Opinion</h2><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/opinion/israel-hamas-war.html" title="">Thomas Friedman</a></strong>: “The death of Sinwar alone is not the sufficient condition to end this Gaza war and put Israelis and Palestinians on a pathway to a better future. Yes, Sinwar and Hamas always rejected a two-state solution and were committed to the violent destruction of the Jewish state. No one paid a bigger price for that than the Palestinians of Gaza. But while his death was necessary for a next step to be possible, it was never going to be everything.”</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/opinion/yahya-sinwar-dead-hamas-gaza.html" title="">Matthew Duss, Center for International Policy</a></strong>: “The Biden administration must press the Netanyahu government and remaining Hamas officials to end the war in Gaza, return hostages to their families, surge humanitarian aid into the territory and urgently take other steps to ensure that Gazans have adequate shelter, supplies and security as winter approaches.”</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-6a6347b2">More on Sinwar’s death</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A poster of Sinwar in Beirut, Lebanon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris McGrath/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><ul><li><p>Israel spent months looking for Sinwar.
