Gordon in U.S. District Court in New Jersey does not appear to explicitly state whether the program should proceed while the federal authorities address his concerns.</p><p>The lawsuit was among the last major obstacles to congestion pricing. New Jersey officials have sought to stop the plan, arguing that federal transportation officials allowed New York to move forward with it without adequately assessing its possible environmental effects on their state.</p><p>The case was widely considered among the most formidable threats to the tolling plan, which still faces several lawsuits in New York and New Jersey.</p><p>Congestion pricing aims to provide funding for mass transit in New York City by charging most motorists $9 to enter Manhattan at 60th Street or below.</p><p>In his decision, Judge Gordon ruled partly in favor of New Jersey’s claims that an extensive environmental study had not sufficiently explained how the tolling program’s potential adverse effects on New Jersey would be mitigated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The lack of specificity as to mitigation for some of these communities warrants further explanation, and if appropriate, reconsideration,” Judge Gordon wrote.</p><p>The ruling in the New Jersey case — which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/nyregion/nj-congestion-pricing-federal-court.html" title="">argued in court in April</a> — has taken on renewed urgency since Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-hochul.html" title="">resurrected the program</a> in November. She had paused it in June, weeks before it was set to begin, citing concerns that the tolls were too high for many New Yorkers and could hurt the city’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, many experts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc-economy.html" title="">disputed</a> that idea.</p><p>Any further delay could give its opponents an opportunity to stop congestion pricing for good. President-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to kill the program when he takes office in January, saying the added costs could keep tourists away from Manhattan and hurt businesses.</p><p>Janno Lieber, the chief executive of the M.T.A., suggested that the judge’s remaining concerns had been addressed by actions taken in recent weeks and would be simple to resolve.</p><p>“We’re gratified that on virtually every issue, Judge Gordon agreed with the New York federal court and rejected New Jersey’s claim that the environmental assessment approved 18 months ago was deficient,” Mr. Lieber said in a prepared statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Michael Gerrard, a Columbia Law School professor who supports congestion pricing, said that Judge Gordon did not specifically prohibit the program from starting. “He is giving the Federal Highway Administration the opportunity to dot all the i’s and cross all the t’s, but he’s not standing in the way of the startup of congestion pricing,” Mr. Gerrard said.</p><p>Mr. Gerrard added that the judge did not issue an injunction. “I think the legal pathway is now clear for congestion pricing to begin on Jan. 5.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Ley is a Times reporter covering New York City’s mass transit system and the millions of passengers who use it.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-ley">More about Ana Ley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Winnie Hu is a Times reporter covering the people and neighborhoods of New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/winnie-hu">More about Winnie Hu</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
