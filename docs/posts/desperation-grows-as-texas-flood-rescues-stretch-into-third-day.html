This was his first rescue operation, said Rachel Ault, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.</p><p>There were 12 rescue helicopters, including ones from the National Guard and the Army, on site at Camp Mystic, the Christian summer camp for girls on the Guadalupe River that was devastated by flooding. Mr. Ruskan “was the main person on the scene triaging everyone,” Ms. Ault said.</p><p>More than 850 people had been rescued as of Saturday night, and more than 1,700 people have been involved in the operations, officials said. Eleven girls from Camp Mystic remain unaccounted for.</p><p>“We will be relentless in going after and assuring that we locate every single person who has been a victim of this flooding event,” Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said on Saturday at a news conference. “We are not going to stop today or tomorrow. We will stop when the job is completed.”</p><p>Mr. Abbott also requested a federal disaster declaration, a move that would direct federal assistance to the affected area. President Trump granted the declaration on Sunday morning.</p><p>Searches continued on Sunday even as forecasters warned of more rain and possible flash flooding.</p><p>City officials in Kerrville, the seat of Kerr County, have urged people not to go out to conduct search-and-rescue operations and have asked people not to use personal drones over affected areas.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Talya Minsberg is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
