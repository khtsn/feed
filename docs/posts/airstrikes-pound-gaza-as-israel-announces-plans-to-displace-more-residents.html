Hospitals across the Gaza Strip reported casualties caused by other airstrikes throughout the day, said a ministry official, Zaher Al-Wuhaidi. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the target of the attack.</p><p>The renewed violence came after Israel announced earlier this week that it was calling up tens of thousands of military reservists to enact the expansion of the war.

Mr. Jneed said his family had already been displaced at least six times since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">war began in October 2023</a>.</p><p>“Displacement means death, humiliation, homelessness,” Mr. Jneed added.</p><p>Mr. Jneed is likely to be among the first affected by Israel’s plan to capture large sections of Gaza and force those living there to move south. The Israeli authorities said on Monday that they were calling up tens of thousands of military reservists to enact the expansion of the war. Israeli leaders say they hope that the campaign will pressure Hamas to compromise in stalled cease-fire negotiations, and release the hostages it still holds in Gaza.</p><p>All of this has contributed to a deeper sense of gloom among Gazan civilians. Wafa al-Ghouty, 35, an accountant and mother of five, said she had been displaced seven times since the start of the war. She is now sheltering in a tent in a coastal area of southern Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced people in Jabalia, Gaza, last month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A charity kitchen in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, in April.
