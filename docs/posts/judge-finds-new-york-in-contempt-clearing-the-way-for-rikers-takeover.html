Since then, a court-appointed monitor has issued regular reports on the violence that has continued to plague the facilities. In the past two years, at least 33 people have died in the jails or shortly after being released.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The federal monitor, Steve J. Martin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/nyregion/rikers-island-jail-report.html" title="">filed a report last year saying that violence was unabated</a> in the jails and that officials were hiding information about it. Mr. Martin’s team recommended that the judge consider holding the Department of Correction in contempt.</p><p>On Wednesday, Judge Swain found the city in contempt of 18 provisions reached in the settlement. She wrote that the nine years since the deal was reached had shown that depending on jail officials who answer to politicians would merely mean more confrontation and delay.</p><p>“The current management structure and staffing are insufficient to turn the tide within a reasonable period,” Judge Swain wrote, noting “that enormous resources — that the city devotes to a system that is at the same time overstaffed and underserved — are not being deployed effectively”</p><p>The lawyers who filed the suit against the city — from the Legal Aid Society and the firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward &amp; Maazel — called Wednesday’s ruling “a historic decision,” in a joint statement.</p><p>“The culture of brutality on Rikers Island has resisted judicial and political reform efforts for years,” they said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Last November, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, formally joined calls for the appointment of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/nyregion/rikers-island-federal-takeover.html" title="">outside authority to take control of Rikers Island</a>.
