To others, he’s a bulldozer who eroded democratic institutions, and is leaving a host of problems for his successor.</p><p>Still, as he comes to the end of his term, his critics and supporters largely agree on one thing: Mr. López Obrador transformed his nation — more so than any other leader in the country’s recent history.</p><p>“This is definitely a watershed presidency that has changed the direction of the country,” said Andrew Paxman, a historian at Mexico’s Center for Research and Teaching in Economics, who is writing a biography of Mr. López Obrador.</p><p>Blending populist rhetoric with hard-line tactics, Mr. López Obrador expanded his own influence. Over the last decade, he has forged a political movement that mirrored his own personal grievances and tapped into the public’s desire for change. Fusing nationalist and leftist ideals, he vowed to bring change to this country of 130 million.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And in many areas, he then delivered on that pledge, and is now leaving office with <a href="https://oraculus.mx/aprobacion-presidencial/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approval ratings</a> above 70 percent.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. López Obrador will step down and hand the mantle to his longtime protégée, Claudia Sheinbaum, a former mayor of Mexico City. The landslide win in June by Ms. Sheinbaum — Mexico’s first female president — was seen by many as a clear vote of confidence in Mr. López Obrador and Morena, the party he founded in 2014. June’s elections also gave Morena large legislative majorities unseen in Mexico since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/03/world/mexico-election-overview-challenger-mexico-wins-governing-party-concedes.html" title="">transition to democracy</a> in 2000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A large crowd in Mexico City cheers for Mr. López Obrador, who leaves office with approval ratings above 70 percent.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cesar Rodriguez para The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We laid the foundations for the transformation that the country needed,” Mr. López Obrador told a crowd of supporters in his last State of the Union address this month. “We made it clear that power only makes sense and becomes a virtue when it is placed at the service of others.”</p><p>Mr. López Obrador nearly tripled the minimum wage and raised millions out of poverty. In making inequality a major topic of national conversation, analysts and his supporters say, he also empowered millions of Mexicans who felt they had been disregarded by the political establishment for decades and infused them with a sense of validation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the same time, he was exceptionally divisive, facing criticism for seeking revenge against his critics, eroding democratic checks and balances and failing to impede widespread cartel violence.</p><p>He plowed billions of dollars into infrastructure projects in the country’s underdeveloped south that created jobs and lowered unemployment, but his initiatives also created huge cost overruns, caused major environmental damage and incurred serious legal challenges.</p><p>In one of his final acts as president, Mr. López Obrador overhauled the judicial system, which had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/world/americas/mexico-electoral-bill-supreme-court.html" title="">thwarted</a> some of his most ambitious proposals, such as hobbling the electoral watchdog agency that helped shift Mexico from one-party rule. The measure will shift the judiciary from an appointment-based system grounded in training and qualifications to one in which voters must now elect judges.</p><p>The change was needed to modernize the courts, the president and his supporters said, and to instill trust in a system plagued by corruption, influence-peddling and nepotism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judiciary workers on strike at the Federal Judiciary Council building last month in Mexico City, protesting changes proposed by Mr. López Obrador.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luis Antonio Rojas para The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But the proposal was met with fierce resistance from judicial workers, law experts, investors, opposition legislators and others. Mr. López Obrador’s determination to push it through kept financial markets on edge and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/americas/mexico-us-pause-relations.html" title="">caused a diplomatic spat</a> with the U.S. and Canada’s ambassadors.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Critics warned that the plan would do little to rid the judiciary of its problems. Instead, they said it would erode judicial independence in a country where running for office can be a death sentence and enable Mr. López Obrador’s political movement to concentrate power.</p><h2 id="link-3e240a6d">‘The Poor Come First.’</h2><p>If Mr. López Obrador governed like an outsider, it is because he was one.</p><p>In a political culture where scions of prominent families have long occupied positions of power, he came from a small-town family of shopkeepers in Tabasco, a state in southeast Mexico. His contact from a very young age with some of the poorest people in Mexico shaped his approach to politics, analysts say.</p><p>After college, he spent years living and working with the Chontal Maya, an Indigenous people, to improve their living conditions before going into politics.</p><p>By 2000, he was elected mayor of Mexico City and began promoting social programs like old-age pensions and financial support for single mothers. He first ran for president in 2006. After losing by a razor-thin margin, he refused to accept the results and held a huge public ceremony to inaugurate himself as the “legitimate president” of a parallel government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. López Obrador ran again in 2012 and lost. Two years later, in 2014, he founded his own party, the National Regeneration Movement, or Morena. He rode that movement to a presidential landslide victory in 2018, pledging to improve the lives of the poor, reduce violent crime and eradicate corruption.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of Mr. López Obrador after he narrowly lost the presidential election in 2006.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jennifer Szymaszek para The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Reviving a slogan from his 2006 campaign, “For the good of all, the poor come first,” Mr. López Obrador quickly set about doing what previous governments could not — or, some Mexicans say, would not — do.</p><p>Over six years, he nearly tripled the minimum wage and more than doubled old-age pensions, distributed every two months to anyone 65 and older. </p><p>“He did a very huge thing: pulling us out of the abyss of poverty,” said Gilgenio López Aguilar, of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán in the southern state of Chiapas.

Many investors worry about how the measure could affect the judicial impartiality needed to resolve disputes between businesses and the government.</p><p>Other concerns are building over Mexico’s economy. Mr. López Obrador’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/world/americas/mexico-oil-sheinbaum-pemex.html" title="">huge bet</a> on fossil fuels transformed Pemex, the state-controlled oil giant, into the world’s most indebted oil company, stirring fears that it could unleash economic chaos if it defaults — unless it keeps getting multibillion-dollar bailouts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>And although Mexico benefited from manufacturers’ relocating from China in a “near-shoring” boom, the country’s economic growth averaged just 0.9 percent annually under Mr. López Obrador — <a href="https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/2024/09/25/crecimiento-economico-con-amlo-es-el-mas-bajo-en-36-anos/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the weakest performance</a> of any president in the last 30 years.</p><p>In one of his shrewdest tactics, Mr. López Obrador held daily televised news conferences, harnessing his charisma and gift for communication to strengthen a personal connection to his supporters.
