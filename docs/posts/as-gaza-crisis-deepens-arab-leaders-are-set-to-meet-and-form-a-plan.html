The Egyptian government did not respond to a request for comment, but the editor in chief of Al Ahram Weekly, a state-owned media outlet, confirmed the document’s authenticity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Arab summit was originally called in response to Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-gaza-netanyahu-takeover.html" title="">proposal</a> last month to expel Palestinians from Gaza, send them to Egypt and Jordan and turn the territory into a tourism hub — an idea that much of the world has rejected as tantamount to ethnic cleansing.</p><p>Egypt, Jordan and other Arab allies of the United States have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-egypt-jordan.html" title="">pushed back</a> hard on the plan, saying it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/middleeast/egypt-jordan-gaza-trump.html" title="">destroy</a> any remaining hope of a Palestinian state and destabilize the entire region.</p><p>Mr. Trump appeared to soften his position recently, saying that he was “not forcing” his Gaza idea on anyone. But the Arab world remains deeply concerned. Adding to those worries is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-cease-fire-assess.html" title="">uncertainty</a> surrounding the cease-fire in Gaza, which has paused the bloodshed there for six weeks and seen Israel and Hamas exchange Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A funeral for a former hostage, Itzik Elgarat, in Nir Oz, Israel, on Monday.

Israel says it is responding to a rising threat of militancy from the West Bank. The Israeli military denies any forced evacuations, but has said it ordered people to leave buildings close to what it said were militant hide-outs.</p><p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has plagued the Middle East for decades. But recent events have brought the question of how to resolve it to a head, forcing Arab countries to scramble over the last few weeks to come up with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/middleeast/gaza-reconstruction-alternatives.html" title="">counterproposal</a> to Mr. Trump’s.</p><p>Beyond insisting on Palestinian statehood and rejecting forcible displacement, Arab countries have not yet agreed on an alternative vision for Gaza — let alone one that Palestinian political factions, Israel, the United States and other countries would sign on to.</p><p>Many major questions remain, such as how to govern Gaza, how to manage its security, how to rebuild it and how to sideline Hamas, which remains the most powerful force in the enclave.</p><p>And any plan would have to get around a more fundamental issue: While Arab leaders will support only a framework that would include at least a nominal path toward Palestinian statehood, Israeli leaders are against embarking on a path that would lead to Palestinian sovereignty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The leaders of Egypt, Jordan and Gulf Arab states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/world/middleeast/arab-leaders-plan-gaza.html" title="">met last month</a> in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to strategize ahead of Tuesday’s summit in Cairo, which will include all 22 members of the Arab League as well as the United Nations secretary general and the European Council’s president.</p><p>But the leaders of two of the most powerful Gulf nations — Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — do not plan to attend the Cairo summit, raising question about whether there is unified Arab support for Egypt’s plan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children gathering on Monday in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hatem Khaled/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>According to the draft proposal expected to be discussed on Tuesday, the transitional governing committee would pave the way for the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that administers parts of the West Bank, to “fully return” to Gaza. The authority administered Gaza until Hamas, which had won parliamentary elections in 2006, seized control of the strip by force in 2007.</p><p>Gaza and the West Bank should be united as one state, Arab officials argue, and must be linked in any conversations about Gaza. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, has so far appeared reluctant to give his blessing to any governing arrangement that does not put him fully in control of Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>One open question concerns who will manage Gaza’s security after the war permanently ends. Egypt is proposing an international force be deployed in Gaza and the West Bank, according to the draft, which does not specify which countries might supply troops to such a force.</p><p>Hamas officials have said they would be willing to hand over control of civilian affairs to a governing committee of which the group was not a part, as long as Gaza’s postwar future was determined by Palestinian “national consensus,” according to a statement from the group on Tuesday.</p><p>But they refuse to demilitarize in Gaza, a crucial demand of both Israel and Mr. Trump. The American president’s top Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said in an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-witkoff-face-the-nation-transcript-02-23-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with CBS’s “Face the Nation” last month that Hamas “has to go.” An official media outlet belonging to Hamas said on Tuesday that “the resistance’s weapons are a red line.”</p><p>The Egyptian proposal acknowledges that it will be difficult to disarm Palestinian groups in Gaza. But the draft suggests that the armed Palestinian resistance will only disappear once the Palestinians secure statehood and rights, saying the issue can be resolved “if its causes are removed through a clear horizon and a credible political process that ensures the legitimate rights of Palestinians.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mohammad Mustafa, the Palestinian prime minister, left, and the Egyptian foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, meeting in Cairo, on Monday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mohamed Hossam/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>The Egyptian proposal is most detailed when it comes to Gaza’s reconstruction. Palestinians in Gaza would stay in temporary housing units made of shipping containers on seven sites throughout the territory, with an average of six people living in each. In the first phase, which would last six months and cost $3 billion, rubble and unexploded ordnance would be cleared, 1.2 million people would be moved into prefabricated temporary housing units and 60,000 partially destroyed housing units would start to be rehabilitated.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In the next phase, which Egypt estimates would cost $20 billion and last until 2027, utilities and permanent housing would be rebuilt, and rubble would be used to expand Gaza’s surface area into the sea. Industrial zones, a fishing port, a seaport and an airport would be built during a final phase costing $30 billion and lasting until 2030, according to the draft.</p><p>Under this framework, oil-rich Gulf nations would likely pay for Gaza’s reconstruction, though Egyptian officials have also suggested Europe could also contribute funds. The draft says that Egypt will convene a donor conference to drum up funding and investments “as soon as possible.”</p><p>Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said in a news conference on Saturday with the Palestinian prime minister and foreign minister that Egypt had volunteered to train Palestinian police forces to be deployed in Gaza while the territory is rebuilt.</p><p>Jordan is also training Palestinian police personnel, according to the Egyptian draft proposal, which said other countries could possibly join that effort.</p><p>Natan Odenheimer<!-- --> and <!-- -->Aaron Boxerman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and <!-- -->Rania Khaled<!-- --> from Cairo.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
