name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The World Food Program said it is suspending deliveries of aid in Gaza after one of its humanitarian teams was hit by gunfire this week as it approached an Israeli military checkpoint.</p><p><a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-temporarily-suspend-staff-movement-across-gaza-following-security-incident-targeted-wfp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, the United Nations agency said none of its employees were injured during the shooting on Tuesday night, which occurred after a convoy of its trucks had delivered assistance to central Gaza. The agency said one of its vehicles had been hit by 10 bullets — five on the driver’s side — a few yards from the Israeli security post at the Wadi Gaza bridge.</p><p>The statement did not assign responsibility for the shooting, but it said Tuesday’s attack was not the first time a W.F.P. team had come under attack while nearing an Israeli checkpoint in Gaza — even after receiving permission to approach. As a result, it said it was “pausing the movement of its employees in Gaza until further notice.”</p><p>“This is totally unacceptable and the latest in a series of unnecessary security incidents that have endangered the lives of W.F.P.’s team in Gaza,” Cindy McCain, the agency’s executive director, said in the statement, which was released Wednesday.</p><p>She demanded that Israeli officials take immediate action to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers delivering aid in Gaza and to improve the system by which aid agencies coordinate their movements with Israeli forces. “The current de-confliction system is failing, and this cannot go on any longer,” Ms. McCain said.</p><p>Earlier this week, the agency’s <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153611" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">main operating hub</a> in Deir al Balah, in the central part of the territory, had to relocate after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for the area. Last week, amid ongoing Israeli military operations, five W.F.P. community kitchens were evacuated and the agency lost access to the only aid warehouse that it was still operating in central Gaza, the statement said.</p><p>The pause in aid deliveries comes at a perilous time for humanitarian efforts and the Palestinians in Gaza who depend on them. As Israel’s military offensive nears its 11th month, nearly half a million people in Gaza face starvation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-hunger-palestinians.html" title="">experts have warned</a>.</p><p>In April, an Israeli drone strike killed seven workers with the World Central Kitchen aid group. The organization resumed its work after a brief pause and said in June <a href="https://www.worldcentralkitchen.org/news/gaza-50million" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it had delivered</a> more than 50 million meals in Gaza since the war began.</p><p>Israeli military officials have said the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy was a “grave mistake” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/world/middleeast/israel-military-world-central-kitchen-strike.html" title="">cited a series of failures</a>, including a breakdown in communication and violations of the military’s operating procedures.</p><p>Adding to the humanitarian concerns, a 10-month old child was diagnosed with polio this month, the first confirmed case of the disease in Gaza in a quarter-century. UNICEF, the U.N. children’s agency, <a href="https://x.com/unicefpalestine/status/1827639643304587740?s=48&amp;t=GBAOz76-FxJriEmQIe8AGw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is hoping</a> to start a campaign to vaccinate children in Gaza as early as this weekend, and has asked Israel to pause military operations to allow it to take place.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lara Jakes, based in Rome, reports on diplomatic and military efforts by the West to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.
