Like her Republican rival, former President Donald J. Trump, Ms. Harris has not offered detailed plans on many other issues. The expected document will be a roughly 80-page overview of her economic policy priorities, though it is unclear how many specifics it will include.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A goal for Ms. Harris’s campaign is to present a tangible economic plan that it can contrast with Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that Mr. Trump has tried to distance himself from, according to one of the people familiar with the campaign’s thinking.</p><p>The Harris campaign declined to comment.</p><p>Many voters still say they want to know more about Ms. Harris, and the economy remains the top issue in the election. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/times-siena-polls-arizona-georgia-north-carolina.html" title="">recent polls of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina</a> conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, 12 percent of voters who are still open to changing their mind on a candidate said they had concerns about Ms. Harris’s handling of the economy. Mr. Trump led in all three states.</p><p>Mr. Trump has long enjoyed a polling advantage on the economy in this race, first over President Biden and then over Ms. Harris after she replaced the president as the Democratic nominee. Many voters remain pessimistic about the economy’s direction under the Biden-Harris administration and nostalgic for its performance under Mr. Trump — and they often blame the current administration for a surging inflation rate that has fallen back to typical levels only in the past year.</p><p>Ms. Harris’s attempt to more clearly articulate her economic approach comes as Mr. Trump continues to try and define his rival’s agenda as “radical.” During an economic speech in Georgia on Tuesday, Mr. Trump labeled Ms. Harris as “communist” and called her the “tax queen.” He said her plan to raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent would drive companies out of the United States.</p><p>“They love her in other countries because she forces everybody out of our country into their hands,” said Mr. Trump. He has floated a plan to lower the corporate rate for domestic manufacturers to 15 percent if elected.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Harris’s campaign has criticized Mr. Trump for his promises to raise tariffs on imports to the United States. The vice president has called his plan a “national sales tax” that would raise prices for many American families, including those on the lower end of the income spectrum.</p><p>Ms. Harris has begun to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25171447-240405-nbc-september-2024-poll_922-release" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">narrow Mr. Trump’s economic advantage</a> in some recent polls, and there are some signs that Americans are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-harris-poll-debate-economy-09-22-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beginning to feel slightly more optimistic</a> about the economy.</p><p>A delicate balancing act for Ms. Harris is how to depart from Mr. Biden’s agenda, which she has done only sparingly since becoming the party’s nominee. Ms. Harris is seeking to raise taxes on investment gains for high-income Americans less dramatically than Mr. Biden proposed — the result of an attempt to show that Ms. Harris is more moderate than the president.</p><p>Ms. Harris has also come under pressure for a separate plan to tax the unrealized capital gains of Americans making more than $100 million. That plan, proposed in Mr. Biden’s budget, would require those wealthy Americans to pay a 25 percent tax on a combination of their regular income, like wages, and the appreciation in assets, like stocks and real estate, before they are sold.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Ms. Harris has said she supports a “billionaire minimum tax,” the name of the plan in Mr. Biden’s budget. But behind the scenes, her advisers have explored alternative ways of raising taxes on ultrawealthy Americans without targeting unrealized gains. Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the idea of taxing unrealized gains.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Outside groups that support Ms. Harris have urged her to be more direct and populist with voters about her economic philosophy — though they do not always agree on what that should look like.</p><p>The Democratic research firm Blueprint has pushed the vice president to blend a message of reducing the federal budget deficit and cracking down on “bad actor” corporations that it says unfairly rip off Americans.</p><p>“On the economy, Harris has the opportunity to thread the needle by presenting a message that focuses on lowering prices, addressing fiscal concerns and promoting targeted government action against corporations that exploit consumers,” the firm wrote in a swing-state polling memo this week.</p><p>Other liberal groups have pushed Ms. Harris to go further and pitch herself more firmly as siding with consumers over big companies.</p><p>“Harris should lay out her diagnosis for why Americans don’t have the economic opportunity she wants them to have,” Lindsay Owens, executive director of Groundwork Action in Washington, said. “This is key to connecting with voters on the economy because it helps them to understand what types of policy remedies she will prescribe if elected.”</p><p>Voters, Ms. Owens added, “want to know if the problem is that corporations have too much power and workers have too little — or if she is more worried about something else.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Tankersley writes about economic policy at the White House and how it affects the country and the world.
