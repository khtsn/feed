For weeks now, U.S. allies have wondered whether Americans would defend them in a war. Now many are wondering whether this made-for-Fox-News national security team is even capable of doing so without exposing military plans to the enemy.</p><p>“JD Vance and his mates clearly aren’t fit to run a group chat, let alone the world’s strongest military force,” Sir Ed Davey, a member of the British Parliament and the leader of the Liberal Democrats, <a href="https://x.com/EdwardJDavey/status/1904296643073122715" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X. “It has to make our security services nervous about the intelligence we’re sharing with them.”</p><p>Although many foreign leaders kept mum about the scandal — why attract President Trump’s wrath? — signs of deep anxiety weren’t hard to find. Peter Boehm, a member of the Senate in Canada — a country that is reeling from Trump’s tariffs and his threats to make it the 51st state — told me that countries might begin to quietly limit the intelligence that they share with the United States, depending on the subject matter. And Richard Fadden, Canada’s former spy chief, told The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/26/canada-five-eyes-security-signal-leak-white-house-response" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that</a> “Canada needs to think about what this means in practical terms: Is the United States prepared to protect our secrets, as we are bound to protect theirs?”</p><p>Even in Israel, a close ally, a former senior official with the Mossad, the country’s spy agency, said the Signal episode “should serve as a major warning sign about how much we can trust U.S. intelligence during President Donald Trump’s second term,” according to <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2025-03-26/ty-article/.premium/you-cant-trust-the-u-s-trumps-signalgate-scandal-is-no-surprise-to-israels-mossad/00000195-d216-d506-abd5-d2b6db830000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an essay in the publication Haaretz.</a> Still, he said, “our dependence on them is absolute,” so Israelis have little choice but to continue sharing intelligence. “The whole situation is insane,” he said.</p><p>What feels revelatory about the Signal chat is just how unserious this national security team is. It’s not just the emojis or the accidental inclusion of a journalist or the decision to communicate on that app. It’s how focused members of the chat group were on how the attack would be perceived by Trump’s base, rather than on the potential geopolitical repercussions of their actions. Although this text thread was surely just a snippet of an ongoing conversation, it was disturbing that they spent more time discussing “messaging” than say, protecting an ally like Saudi Arabia from retaliation.</p><p>“There’s a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary,” the vice president wrote. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth replied, “I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what,” adding that “nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we need to stay focused on 1.) Biden failed &amp; 2.) Iran funded.”</p><p>Hilariously, Hegseth goes on to say that delaying the operation risks that “this leaks, and we look indecisive” — unaware that the entire world would soon read about it.</p><p>Hegseth is a former Fox News host, chosen for loyalty and good looks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/pete-hegseth-workplace.html" title="">rather than experience</a>. His comments in the chat showcased not only the arrogance and disdain, but the carelessness and cluelessness, of the people in charge of what is supposed to be the world’s most powerful military. These people seem to care more about how things look than how they actually are. That, more than anything, should terrify America’s allies, and Americans themselves.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzFmMzE5MmEwLWEzMmUtNWMyYi05ZWFkLTQ3OWVmZjI2ZWVjNw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#tufts-student-ice-arrest-detention" data-source-id="100000010076963"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/meher-ahmad"><img alt="Meher Ahmad" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/16/opinion/Meher-Ahmad/Meher-Ahmad-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/16/opinion/Meher-Ahmad/Meher-Ahmad-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/16/opinion/Meher-Ahmad/Meher-Ahmad-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-27T21:28:52.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 27, 2025, 5:28 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The footage of Rumeysa Ozturk’s arrest is a familiar sight for those of us who lived in countries with authoritarian regimes. In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/ice-tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk.html" title="">video</a>, Ozturk, a Turkish woman completing her Ph.D. studies at Tufts University, is approached on a sidewalk in Sommerville, Mass., by several plainclothes officers from the Department of Homeland Security while she was on her way to break her Ramadan fast with friends on Tuesday night. One hooded officer grabs her hands and arms as another officer, masked, approaches from her side. Clearly afraid, Ozturk is eventually handcuffed and taken to a black S.U.V.</p><p>This isn’t an isolated event: Ozturk is just the latest international student to have been picked up or targeted this way by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the last month; the common through line to many of the cases is their participation in speech or protests against the war in Gaza, actions that are otherwise protected under this country’s free speech laws. As of Wednesday evening, Ozturk, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mqP9kgYz_FY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had</a> a student visa, had been moved to Louisiana, and her lawyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/ice-tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk.html" title="">said</a> that, to her knowledge, Ozturk had not been charged with a crime.</p><p>It’s important to consider why ICE officers are making these arrests under the guise of immigration violations. Of the students targeted in similar fashion, none are charged with a crime, as far as we know. Rather, the federal government is utilizing a rarely used section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens who could have “potentially <a href="https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030214.html#:~:text=%2D13%2D2021)-,(U)%20INA%20212(a)(3)(C),consequences%20for%20the%20United%20States." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serious adverse</a> foreign policy consequences for the United States.”</p><p>How broadly that could be interpreted under this administration is anyone’s guess. The government has provided very little public information in these cases about what exactly the students allegedly did to undermine U.S. foreign policy. And in an alarming sign, this process has involved not just student visa holders, but also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-student-ice-suit-yunseo-chung.html" title="">green card holders</a>.</p><p>Now, with the Trump administration’s broad use of ICE, it seems as if a precedent is being set: Any noncitizen can face the same type of political detentions we associate with regimes abroad.</p><p>Were Ozturk or others arrested by local or state police officers, they’d have much more due process. They could ask for bail. They could not be moved across state lines without reason and held indefinitely in federal detention facilities, as Mahmoud Khalil, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/georgetown-suri-detained.html" title="">Badar Khan Suri</a> and Ozturk currently are while pursuing legal appeals.</p><p>Politically motivated detentions and deportations aren’t the only way the Trump administration is pushing the legal boundaries of ICE’s purview. The families of several Venezuelan men seeking asylum say the men were wrongfully arrested and deported to a Salvadorean mega prison because they were <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/trump-el-salvador-venezulea-deportation-prison-cecot-bukele/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mistakenly thought to be associated</a> with the Tren de Aragua gang. In those deportations, too, the administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/alien-enemies-act-trump.html" title="">invoked</a> a little-used law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, declaring the gang an enemy of the nation to speed up deportations of Venezuelan migrants with very little due process.</p><p>Effectively, these types of arrests could transform ICE into an extrajudicial force, one that could hold any noncitizen — regardless of the individual’s legal status — under an increasingly opaque and authoritarian set of laws. You could be in this country legally, even invited here on a Fulbright scholarship, as Ozturk was, and, without being accused of a crime, be taken off the street. Even though Ozturk’s arrest is a familiar sight to many, it’s difficult to believe that it’s happening here, today, in America.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzUyY2JmOTI0LTBlMmQtNWE4Zi04Njc4LWFhN2MxYjY1YTZhOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#ukraine-russia-black-sea-trump-putin" data-source-id="100000010076243"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/serge-schmemann"><img alt="Serge Schmemann" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/opinion/serge-schmemann-headshot/serge-schmemann-headshot-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-27T16:04:45.066Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 27, 2025, 12:04 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>In a podcast interview over the weekend, Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s special negotiator on Ukraine, got one thing right. “In the old days, the only people who went into the K.G.B. were the smartest people in the nation,” he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/putin-said-prayed-donald-trump-2024-assassination-attempt-rcna197629" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, musing on Vladimir Putin’s old career. “He’s a super smart guy.”</p><p>Evidence of Putin’s super smartness was on display throughout the interview with Tucker Carlson, as Witkoff basically accepted everything the “gracious” and “straightforward” Russian leader shared with him in their Kremlin meetings (as Carlson had in his infamous interviews with Putin). That included, among other things, that Putin doesn’t want to “absorb Ukraine” any more than Israel wants to occupy Gaza.</p><p>That same super smartness seems to be behind Russia’s approach to the negotiations on an end to fighting in Ukraine, in which U.S. mediators have been talking separately with the two sides. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-black-sea-cease-fire.html" title="">latest product</a> of those talks were agreements by Russia and Ukraine to cease fighting in the Black Sea and to work out details on the earlier agreement to halt strikes on energy facilities.</p><p>The devil in such agreements, goes the cliché, is in the details. With Ukraine, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/03/outcomes-of-the-united-states-and-ukraine-expert-groups-on-the-black-sea/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that it “remains committed to helping achieve” an exchange of prisoners and the release of civilians and children. In other words, Russia did not agree to this crucial Ukrainian demand.</p><p>With Russia, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/03/outcomes-of-the-united-states-and-russia-expert-groups-on-the-black-sea/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it “will help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports.” The Kremlin was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/25/russia-ukraine-black-sea-exports/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more specific</a>: The fighting pause in the Black Sea would come into force only after a host of other sanctions on institutions that are involved in the sale of food and fertilizer were lifted. That would be a big coup for Moscow. Less so for Ukraine, which has forced the Russian Navy into retreat and has managed to restore its agricultural exports through the Black Sea almost to prewar levels. But all President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine could do was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-black-sea-cease-fire.html" title="">lament</a> “a weakening of positions and a weakening of sanctions.”</p><p>That seems to be the pattern of the Trump administration’s mediation so far, starting with the humiliation of Zelensky at the White House and Trump’s friendly 90-minute telephone discussion with Putin. A bullied Zelensky subsequently agreed to Trump’s call for an unconditional cease-fire; Putin did not, agreeing only to a pause in attacks on strikes against energy facilities.</p><p>After that phone call, Pravda.ru didn’t conceal its glee. “Putin won the first round of negotiations with Trump with good chances to take the whole game,” was its headline. No halt to Russia’s offensive; a wedge between America and its European allies, who were locked out of the negotiations; no large prisoner exchange; a potential lifting of sanctions.</p><p>Perhaps even more important, Putin finally achieved what he had long wanted: to relegate Ukraine’s fate to superpower-to-superpower talks between Moscow and Washington, the way it was done in the good old Cold War days. Trump, according to the Russians at least, even threw in a U.S.-Russia hockey tournament. Super smart, right?</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzc3MmE2YTY3LWNhNmItNTk0NC05N2U1LWMyOTAzNGNjNzlhYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#waltz-hegseth-signal-group-chat" data-source-id="100000010073924"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/w-j--hennigan"><img alt="W.J.

If any lower-level officials in our government did such a thing, they would lose their jobs — or at the very least be severely punished, and deservedly so.</p><p>President Trump made pretty clear on Wednesday evening that he wasn’t eager to fire anyone over the editor of The Atlantic being inadvertently added to a chat in which senior officials openly discussed U.S. military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen before they occurred. Trump told reporters that people should be focused instead on the success of the military strikes. “There was no harm done,” he said of the group chat, adding that Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, had <a href="https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1905013633265877029" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taken</a> responsibility for it — though the president did spend some time questioning the validity of Signal.</p><p>It is clear now, however, that Trump — who issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> on government accountability — needs to hold someone accountable for what occurred. Otherwise, it sets an unacceptable precedent that this can happen again.</p><p>It’s not been explained how or why senior government officials are using Signal, a publicly available messaging application, when the U.S. government spends millions of dollars on encrypted classified networks and information security. One after another, senior officials have publicly avoided serious responsibility for what occurred.</p><p>Waltz, who reportedly included the editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, on the chat, said he was responsible for creating the chat but <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1904681178327548105" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried</a> to sidestep the blunder. “Have you ever had somebody’s contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else’s number there? Right? You’ve got somebody else’s number on someone else’s contact,” he said in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News on Tuesday.</p><p>Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/news-conference/defense-secretary-hegseth-on-signal-group-chat-on-yemen-strikes/657765" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reiterated</a> on Wednesday that he didn’t text “war plans.” But as messages newly released by The Atlantic show, he’s simply playing semantics. The reported messages show that he texted the precise time when U.S. Navy fighter jets would take off from aircraft carriers at sea and the time they would release their bombs over Houthi targets.</p><p>If the Houthis or other adversaries, rather than Goldberg, had had this information, it would have made those combat pilots’ lives even more vulnerable as they executed their mission. The Houthis have shot down U.S. drones with antiaircraft weapons.</p><p>Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1904966208652558428" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Wednesday that someone “made a big mistake” in inviting Goldberg to the group chat. John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, who both participated in the chat, testified in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday that they didn’t disclose classified information. That may be technically accurate, but they spoke openly about an ongoing operation in front of someone who wasn’t authorized to know about it.</p><p>I’m confident that neither Ratcliffe nor Gabbard would invite Goldberg to sit in on their briefings about the lead-up to a strike. So why they wouldn’t admit a mistake was made is beyond comprehension.</p><p>It’s difficult to hold public confidence in the information security apparatus if the response from the officials involved is a comedic defense of their own actions: The national security adviser can’t fully explain how she texted someone, and cabinet secretaries play word games around the contents of a conversation that the entire world can now read for themselves.</p><p>In previous administrations, this matter would have been investigated by the Defense Department’s inspector general, but Trump fired him during the first week of his second term. Regardless, haphazardly disclosing sensitive information about a planned and ongoing military operation cannot be permissible. The fact that no one has admitted real wrongdoing or acknowledged that a lesson was learned makes it even more unbearable.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzMxODY4Zjc0LTMyMzItNTUzMy04NjlhLWJjMjZiNjcwMTgzMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#atlantic-war-plans-signal-group-chat" data-source-id="100000010073858"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-26T16:07:54.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 26, 2025, 12:07 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>“We are currently clean on OPSEC,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth texted to his pals at the highest levels of the Trump administration, just before U.S. forces dropped bombs on Yemen, according to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">details released by The Atlantic</a>. OPSEC stands for “operational security,” and Hegseth’s assurance was stunningly false, since none of the gang discussing the attack had bothered to question why someone named J.G. (the initials of Jeff Goldberg, the magazine’s editor) was right there in the group chat with them.</p><p>The texts released by The Atlantic make it clear that members of the administration’s highest echelon — including Vice President JD Vance and John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director — not only are terrible at operational security but also seem to have a vast disregard for the inconveniences that true security requires. For the past two days, in fact, it has become obvious that the administration’s definition of OPSEC is very different from a regular person’s. To the White House, the term means only one thing: bending reality — by lying, sneering and stonewalling — so that the official narrative of this embarrassment makes an innocent administration the victim of a left-wing media conspiracy.</p><p>“This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,” <a href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/1904875629612331123" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Karoline Leavitt</a>, the White House press secretary, on social media Wednesday morning. The Atlantic had conceded, she said, that “these were NOT ‘war plans.’”</p><p>The Atlantic conceded no such thing. It used the phrase “attack plans” in its headline, and anyone reading Hegseth’s boastful, frat-boy description of what American service members were about to do can have no doubt that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/hegseth-signal-war-plan-leak-white-house.html?smid=url-share" title="">he revealed</a> secret military details. “‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME — also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s),” he wrote. This was roughly half an hour before the first warplanes took off, and a few minutes later he told the group that a group of sea-based Tomahawk missiles had been launched — all invaluable information to an enemy, including the exact time and nature of the attacks. After the assault was over, he told the group that the U.S. had a positive ID of a Houthi leader walking into a building that was bombed.</p><p>And yet the White House continued to insist that nothing unusual had happened, as if the sky were blue during a hurricane. “No locations,” <a href="https://x.com/MikeWaltz47/status/1904888948628877756" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Michael Waltz</a>, the national security adviser, who was responsible for inviting Goldberg into the chat. “No sources &amp; methods. NO WAR PLANS.” From President Trump to Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, everyone insisted that there was nothing classified or even particularly sensitive about the information in the chat, leading Goldberg and his colleagues to reconsider their careful decision on Monday not to publish the military details that Hegseth had texted. Rather than acknowledge the discretion of the editors, White House officials said the newly released texts showed that the magazine had been lying all along. “What scumbags!” <a href="https://x.com/Taylor47/status/1904874968581632040" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Taylor Budowich</a>, the deputy chief of staff.</p><p>Normally, the F.B.I. would already be looking into this security breach, but that isn’t going to happen under Trump’s lackey director, Kash Patel, and the White House can probably prevail on congressional Republicans not to conduct hearings or a proper investigation. But what members of the administration can no longer effectively do is pretend that their incompetent and reckless actions didn’t happen. It’s all there in black and white and in childish strong-arm emojis, and history will not be fooled by their cheap attempt to edit the facts.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNlOGEzYjE1LTNhMTktNWI5Yi1iOTNhLTIyZjlkZmNiYTQ3Ng=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#no-other-land-director-west-bank" data-source-id="100000010072101"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-kristof"><img alt="Nicholas Kristof" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-25T19:45:37.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 25, 2025, 3:45 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Earlier this month, Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian filmmaker, won an Oscar for best documentary feature for “No Other Land,” an exploration of repression in the West Bank.</p><p>Now back from the red carpet and in his home village of Susya in the West Bank, Ballal was detained overnight by Israeli troops on Monday after, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/world/middleeast/israel-police-hamdan-ballal-palestinian.html" title="">he said</a>, he was beaten by an Israeli attacker. The events seemed to underscore the systematic injustice highlighted in his documentary.</p><p>There were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/oscar-winning-palestinian-film-director-attacked-by-israeli-settlers-detained-46d9b2de" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disputes</a> about what precisely had unfolded, as there often are; the Israeli military said Ballal had been detained on suspicion of throwing stones, which his lawyer denied, and it released him on Tuesday.</p><p>But what is indisputable is that the United Nations has reported that attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians — often with Israeli troops standing by — have increased substantially. The U.N. <a href="https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-252-west-bank" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documented</a> an average of almost four violent settler attacks a day in 2024, reportedly in which five Palestinians, including a child, were killed. It is also true, of course, that Palestinians periodically attack settlers and troops, mostly by rock throwing.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/movies/no-other-land-oscars-documentary.html" title="">No Other Land</a>,” a joint project of Israelis and Palestinians, highlighted the destruction of Palestinian homes in the West Bank and unequal justice there. It received rave reviews in addition to the Oscar but was unable to get distribution in the United States, making it difficult for Americans to see it.</p><p>Ballal was set upon by people wearing masks and armed with rocks, sticks and knives, according to an account <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/middleeast/no-other-land-director-attack.html" title="">cited in The Times</a> from a witness who is part of a volunteer effort to protect Palestinian areas from settler violence.</p><p>The Times reviewed video footage of part of the event, in which a masked man attacks several peace activists who had responded to Palestinian appeals for help. When the activists retreated to their car, attackers smashed the windshield with a rock.</p><p>All this reflects the impunity that violent settlers have largely enjoyed as they attack Palestinians, vandalize their property and in some cases try to drive them off their land. President Trump added to the impunity by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/world/middleeast/israel-trump-settlers-west-bank-gaza.html" title="">rescinding sanctions</a> imposed by the Biden administration last year on dozens of far-right Israeli individuals and settler groups accused of violence against Palestinians. Trump made the move right after assuming office, even as Israeli arsonists set fire to Palestinian vehicles and properties.</p><p>Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/mike-huckabee-palestinian-comments-trump-israel-ambassador/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has said that</a> “there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian” and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/19/in-jerusalem-mike-huckabee-calls-west-bank-part-of-israel/" title="">suggested that the West Bank belongs to Israel</a>. His confirmation hearing was held on Tuesday, and he’s very likely to be confirmed soon.</p><p>The United States historically tried, not very hard and not very successfully, to dampen tensions and settlement construction on the West Bank. But now it’s difficult to avoid the impression that the Trump administration is exacerbating a dangerous situation by promoting impunity on one side, making everything both more unjust and more explosive.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzI5M2Q0OWE3LTYwNzMtNTkzMi05YjJlLWJiMDZmZTM5YjAyYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#atlantic-hegseth-vance-houthis" data-source-id="100000010070123"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-french"><img alt="David French" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-24T19:31:16.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 24, 2025, 3:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>I don’t know how Pete Hegseth can look service members in the eye. He’s just blown his credibility as a military leader.</p><p>On Monday, The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg published <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IVJpB2t9BYyxpzU4sooa69M&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the most extraordinary stories I’ve ever read</a>. President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, apparently inadvertently invited Goldberg to join a Signal group chat (Signal is an encrypted messaging app) that seemed to include several senior Trump officials, including Stephen Miller, JD Vance, Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth.</p><p>A National Security Council spokesman told The Atlantic that the chat “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IVJpB2t9BYyxpzU4sooa69M&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appears to be authentic</a>.”</p><p>No one apparently noticed Goldberg’s presence, and he had a front-row seat as they debated Trump’s decision to attack the Houthi rebels, an Iran-backed militia that had been firing on civilian shipping in the Red Sea.</p><p>Then, at 11:44 a.m. on March 15, the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” sent a message that contained “operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying and attack sequencing.”</p><p>This would be a stunning breach of security. I’m a former Army JAG officer (an Army lawyer). I’ve helped investigate numerous allegations of classified information spillages, and I’ve never even heard of anything this egregious — a secretary of defense intentionally using a civilian messaging app to share sensitive war plans without even apparently noticing a journalist was in the chat.</p><p>There is not an officer alive whose career would survive a security breach like that. It would normally result in instant consequences (relief from command, for example) followed by a comprehensive investigation and, potentially, criminal charges.</p><p>Federal law <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">makes it a crime</a> when a person — through gross negligence — removes information “relating to the national defense” from “its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted or destroyed.”</p><p>It’s way too soon to say whether Hegseth’s incompetence is also criminal, but I raise the possibility to demonstrate the sheer magnitude of the reported mistake. A security breach that significant requires a thorough investigation.</p><p>Nothing destroys a leader’s credibility with soldiers more thoroughly than hypocrisy or double standards. When leaders break the rules that they impose on soldiers, they break the bond of trust between soldiers and commanders. The best commanders I knew did not ask a soldier to comply with a rule that didn’t also apply to them. The best commanders led by example.</p><p>What example has Hegseth set? That he’s careless, and when you’re careless in the military, people can die. If he had any honor at all, he would resign.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ0ZWQ3NTQ3LTlkNzctNWI4Zi04MzY4LTRiYTQ1NzllYTQ5Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#trump-canada-tariffs" data-source-id="100000010059581"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farah-stockman"><img alt="Farah Stockman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbStandard-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/opinion/stockman-author/stockman-author-thumbLarge-v5.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-21T15:02:24.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 21, 2025, 11:02 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Young/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>I’ll admit that I was sympathetic to Donald Trump’s heresy on trade, during his first term. His tariffs on China and his bid to renegotiate NAFTA prompted much pearl clutching from economists and pundits, but I knew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/us/union-jobs-mexico-rexnord.html" title="">from my reporting</a> how many people in factory towns across America wanted him to do those things. The renegotiation of NAFTA was, ultimately, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/opinion/trump-trade-nafta.html" title="">a bipartisan success story</a>. It passed overwhelmingly. By the end of his first term, many people — including Democrats — acknowledged quietly that tariffs on China and updating NAFTA were necessary. President Joe Biden didn’t reverse them. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/biden-tariffs-chinese-goods-clothing.html" title="">built</a> on them. But now Trump seems to have lost the plot.</p><p>He is tearing up that deal that he himself created by imposing 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, our largest trading partners. What gives?</p><p>In the case of Mexico, there have been legitimate concerns that China is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/business/china-mexico-trade.html" title="">getting around</a> U.S. tariffs by building or taking over factories in Mexico. That’s one of a few reasons the U.S. trade deficit with China has declined — to $295 billion last year from $418 billion in 2018 — at the same time the trade deficit with Mexico ballooned to $172 billion last year from roughly $78 billion in 2018, according to Census Bureau data.</p><p>If you worry about chronic trade deficits, as Trump does, that’s a problem. But Trump’s ire at Canada is a mystery. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada is one of the smallest that we have — it was about $19 billion in 2018 and $63 billion last year. <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/economics/2025/01/21/td-economics-energy-accounts-for-all-the-us-canada-trade-deficit/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Virtually all of it</a> can be explained by U.S. purchases of oil, gas and electricity, a reminder that Canada is critical to U.S. energy security.</p><p>Without energy, the United States actually <a href="https://economics.td.com/ca-canada-us-trade-balance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">runs a trade surplus with Canada</a>. Canada is the top export market for 34 states — or at least it was.</p><p>Trump’s targeting of Canada has bewildered even his own political allies on trade. “On Canada, he’s just wrong,” one told me. I can’t pretend to understand what goes on in Trump’s brain. But this much is clear: It ain’t about trade.</p><p>If you listen to his words, Trump is declaring economic war on Canada, our loyal and peaceful neighbor, because he wants to bring it to its knees and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/03/20/why-trump-wants-canada-state/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">take it over as a 51st state</a>. He’s wielding tariffs as a weapon, not to defend American workers, but to execute a hostile takeover of a country. It is a move so bizarre and shocking that nobody can quite believe it is happening.</p><p>I was in Indiana this week, which is full of factory towns that supported Trump. Canada is the <a href="https://connect2canada.com/wp-content/fact-sheets/in.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state’s largest trading partner</a> by far. I didn’t meet a soul who thinks beating up on Canada is a good idea.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2EzNDZhOTg0LTFhNmMtNTFmMC1iZWZiLTY2OGExNWY3NDVlOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#israel-gaza-airstrikes-ceasefire" data-source-id="100000010058384"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-kristof"><img alt="Nicholas Kristof" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-03-18T15:25:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">March 18, 2025, 11:25 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>For now, at least, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has returned to war in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes across Gaza have claimed more than 400 lives, including those of children, according to Gaza’s health authorities, and it seems more clear than ever that Netanyahu doesn’t have a plausible day-after plan for Gaza.</p><p>The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was already on life support, and I’m afraid we’re now tumbling back into the savagery of a particularly brutal war that has left Gaza with the <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/unicef-delivers-wheelchairs-gazas-children" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highest population of child amputees</a> per capita in the world.</p><p>Negotiations on continuing the cease-fire were stalled, and Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/17/world/israel-gaza-airstrikes/927247df-d7cb-591e-b8c2-ef7f9abe0a14?smid=url-share" title="">said</a> that his country had “no alternative but to give the order to reopen fire.” But, of course, Israel had alternatives, as the main advocacy group for family members of Israeli hostages in Gaza noted, albeit alternatives that were not particularly palatable to Israel’s leaders. The hostage families group denounced the airstrikes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/17/world/israel-gaza-airstrikes/israels-government-has-abandoned-the-hostages-by-resuming-attacks-in-gaza-families-say?smid=url-share" title="">saying</a>, “We are shocked, outraged and deeply concerned by the deliberate destruction of the process to bring back our loved ones.”</p><p>Ever since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Netanyahu has brilliantly advanced his own interests while proceeding without any obvious strategy that would advantage Israel. At this point, Israel has leveled much of Gaza, killing some <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-01-15/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">47,000</a> Palestinians, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-war-children-killed-malnutrition-israel-bef00a350a7fbe5a33dfb2c9883803ce" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13,000</a> children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Some think those numbers are inflated, others an undercount: The medical journal The Lancet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/health/gaza-death-toll.html" title="">estimated</a> 64,000 dead.</p><p>What has all this carnage achieved? Hamas’s fighting capacity is badly degraded, the planners of the Oct. 7 attacks have been killed, and Israel has re-established a measure of deterrence: One senior Hamas official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/world/middleeast/hamas-official-interview-attack-israel.html" title="">said</a> recently that he would have opposed the attack if he had known of the consequences for the territory. On the other hand, neither of Israel’s two fundamental aims of the war — freeing all its hostages and destroying Hamas — has been achieved.</p><p>The United States has <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/blinken-we-assess-that-hamas-has-recruited-almost-as-many-new-fighters-as-it-has-lost/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assessed</a> that Hamas has recruited almost as many militants as it has lost, and the group remains in control of Gaza and appears more popular in the West Bank and around the world. Meanwhile, much of global opinion that was sympathetic to Israel in 2023 has turned decisively against it, and fairly or not, the word “genocide” is often associated with it. And the lives of the remaining Israeli hostages are again in peril.</p><p>The United States bears special responsibility for the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, because it is American 2,000-pound bombs that have destroyed entire neighborhoods; such monstrous munitions cannot distinguish between militants and infants. President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/opinion/biden-gaza-war.html" title="">refused</a> to use his leverage to press for an end to the war during his term, and President Trump has already shipped an additional <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-shipment-of-heavy-bombs-held-up-by-biden-administration-arrives-in-israel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,800 of the 2,000-pound bombs</a> to Israel and blithely proposed clearing Gaza of Gazans in what would amount to ethnic cleansing.</p><p>With Netanyahu concerned only with his own career, with the United States adding fuel to the fire, with neither Washington nor Jerusalem showing much concern for what civilians are enduring in Gaza, I’m afraid we should brace ourselves for continued bloodshed and suffering that serve no strategic purpose.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2UzYjBkMTQzLWUwZmUtNTJjZi1hZTI1LTdjZWJkODZlZmEwOQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/opinion/thepoint#netanyahu-shin-bet-israel" data-source-id="100000010056123"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-l-friedman"><img alt="Thomas L.

Netanyahu said that he lost “<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hell-fire-shin-bet-chief-bar-ag-says-he-cant-before-legal-review/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trust</a>” in Bar, who helped command Israel’s hostage rescues in Gaza and hundreds of other operations. Nonsense.</p><p>“A few weeks ago,” <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-16/ty-article/.premium/the-hidden-reason-behind-netanyahus-ugly-shocking-firing-of-israels-shin-bet-chief/00000195-a096-d885-a39f-bbb7e5940000?utm_source=App_Share&amp;utm_medium=iOS_Native" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Yossi Melman, an intelligence expert at Haaretz, with the help of the Shin Bet, “the Israel Police decided to <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-15/ty-article/.premium/israels-shin-bet-is-examining-connection-between-netanyahus-top-aides-and-qatar/00000195-0abb-d0af-a197-cabfa7420000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launch an investigation</a> into two of Netanyahu’s spokespeople and a former strategic adviser over serious suspicions of dubious ties and financial transactions with Qatar, a country that supports terrorist organizations including Hamas — including deals made during the war. ‘Qatar-gate,’ as the scandal has been dubbed, has the potential to lead to charges of behavior bordering on treason.”</p><p>Unlike in today’s America, though, Israel has an independent attorney general — Gali Baharav-Miara — with both legal power and moral integrity, who <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hell-fire-shin-bet-chief-bar-ag-says-he-cant-before-legal-review/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declared late Sunday</a> that Bibi can’t oust Bar “until the factual and legal basis underlying your decision is fully examined, as well as your authority to address the matter at this time.” That’s because Bibi himself is on trial for corruption and should absent himself from making any appointments in law enforcement agencies that might be involved in his own trials.</p><p>This is setting up a constitutional crisis unlike anything Israel has ever seen. Sound familiar? As The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/constitutional-crisis.html" title="">reported,</a> the Trump administration is heading to a “constitutional showdown with the judicial branch of government” as a result of “airplane loads of Venezuelan detainees deplaned in El Salvador even though a federal judge had ordered that the planes reverse course and return the detainees to the United States.”</p><p>Time to stop kidding ourselves, folks. The rule of law is in danger in both America and Israel if some red lines are not drawn and defended right now.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
