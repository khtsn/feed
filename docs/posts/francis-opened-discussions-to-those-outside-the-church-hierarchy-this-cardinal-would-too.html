While he was bishop of Gozo, from 2005 to 2020, he held conservative stances on several issues, including homosexuality and the legalization of divorce, which he opposed when Malta held a referendum in 2011.</p><p>He changed his tone under Francis, who made him a cardinal in 2020, and is seen as someone who would bring continuity to the papacy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The synod began in 2021 with discussions among local churches around the world on issues they felt most pressing, a rare opening for all Catholics to help chart the church’s future.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis and cardinals at the second session of the 16th General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Vatican City last October.

There are 133 cardinals who can vote at the synod. About 60 of those cardinals were present during at least one of the synod’s monthlong discussions in 2023 and 2024 at the Vatican, meaning that in a College of Cardinals where many of them don’t know each other because they are geographically distant, his role has made him a familiar face to many.</p><p>Cardinal Grech has also taken up global causes that were close to Francis. Malta is a key point of entry in the Mediterranean for migrants arriving from Africa, and Cardinal Grech has called on Europe to open its doors, not close them. When the war broke out in Ukraine in 2022, he <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2022-03/cardinal-mario-grech-poland-ukraine-women-human-traffickers.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised alarms that fleeing Ukrainian</a> women and children were at risk of being exploited by human traffickers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis and Cardinal Mario Grech took a ferry to the island of Gozo, Malta, on the first day of the pope’s trip to the Mediterranean archipelago in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Andreas Solaro</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Like other senior church leaders over the last 20 years, Cardinal Grech has been accused by some of not doing enough to reckon with sexual abuse that took place in his diocese. He is one of the cardinals singled out on the website Conclave Watch, which scrutinizes how some cardinals handled abuse cases.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As bishop he began several initiatives to confront abuse, including a <a href="https://www.churchingozo.mt/safeguarding/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commission for protecting children</a> and vulnerable adults. But his critics say that he could have done more in specific cases.</p><p>Some of the allegations in Malta center on Lourdes Home, an orphanage run by the Dominican Sisters of Malta on Gozo. The church commissioned an inquiry into the orphanage, which closed in 2008 and it apologized that year. Pope Benedict XVI <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/world/europe/19pope.html" title="">met privately</a> with some survivors in 2010.</p><p>Lara Dimitrijevic, a lawyer who represents two survivors in a constitutional case against the state currently being heard in Maltese court, said the church should have done more for victims, including offering psychological counseling.</p><p>“There has been such severe trauma that these mothers in their 50s are still suffering today,” she said, calling the abuse “vile.”</p><p>One of her clients in the lawsuit, Carmen Muscat, 52, said she was not satisfied with the role played by Cardinal Grech, and wanted compensation. “We didn’t get justice and it’s not fair,” she said. Cardinal Grech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a Times reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
