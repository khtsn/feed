Mr. Martin has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/rhodes-oath-keepers-dc-capitol-trump.html" title="">started an internal review of Capitol riot cases</a> in his office and was tapped by Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/justice-department-weaponization-group.html" title="">to help scrutinize the so-called weaponization</a> of the department during the Biden administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site that Mr. Martin had been “fighting tirelessly to restore Law and Order, and Make Our Nation’s Capitol Safe and Beautiful Again.”</p><p>“He will get the job done,” Mr. Trump added.</p><p>Until Mr. Trump’s announcement on Monday, it had not been clear whether Mr. Martin, 54, would be selected to permanently lead the office. While many congressional Republicans have publicly cheered him on, some senators and their aides have privately questioned whether he has the temperament and skills to do the job.</p><p>Morale in the U.S. attorney’s office has dropped since Mr. Martin arrived, according to current and former prosecutors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.</p><p>Mr. Martin has described long work days spent burrowed in his office. “Tons to learn. Tons to do. Tons and tons at stake,” <a href="https://eagleedmartin.substack.com/p/on-my-own?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he wrote on Substack</a> shortly after being named to the interim post. His office, he added, was filled with photographs of his family, a large image of “the merciful Christ” and a picture of the anti-feminist activist Phyllis Schlafly. Nearby are a copy of his book and the Bible.</p><p>He has struggled to win the respect of the hundreds of members of his staff. Some have described introductory meetings where he made clear that he saw his job as acting on behalf of Mr. Trump. Others referred to him as a “keyboard warrior,” noting that he fires off serial emails, including one reprimanding prosecutors under him for leaking to the news media — a communication that itself leaked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>And while Mr. Trump claimed he would address crime in the district, Mr. Martin has initially said little about what he plans to do to accomplish that goal.</p><p>Instead he has taken to social media to spout overtly political opinions as no other U.S. attorney has done, suggesting he would investigate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-elon-musk.html" title="">opponents of Elon Musk</a> and the former special counsel Jack Smith, who indicted Mr. Trump for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and for his role in hoarding classified documents at his resort in Florida.</p><p>Mr. Martin served as chief of staff to Matthew Roy Blunt, Missouri’s governor from 2005 to 2009. He later ran conservative organizations, including Missourians United for Life and the Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund, a group once affiliated with Ms. Schlafly.</p><p>He once supervised a legal clinic in St. Louis, Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>Eileen Sullivan<!-- --> and <!-- -->Alan Feuer<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
