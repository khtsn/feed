In fact, the Democratic Party dropped the subject from its 2024 platform, eight years after becoming the first major party to formally call for abolishing the death penalty. But in 2020, President Biden’s campaign platform included a pledge to “work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, and incentivize states to follow the federal government’s example.” Once elected, he became the country’s first sitting president openly opposed to capital punishment.</p><p>It would be an appropriate and humane finale to his presidency for Mr. Biden to fulfill that pledge and try to eliminate the death penalty for federal crimes. Such an effort would also remind the nation that this practice is immoral, unconstitutional and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/opinion/stop-executions-biden-virginia.html" title="">useless as a deterrent to crime</a>.</p><p>For more than two decades now, most barometers of how Americans view capital punishment — the number of new death sentences, the number of executions and the level of public support — have tracked a steady decline. There were 85 executions in 2000 <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/dpic-year-end-reports/the-death-penalty-in-2023-year-end-report" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">but only 24 last year</a> and <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 so far this year</a>, all carried out in only seven states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>While a majority of Americans, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/capital-punishment-death-penalty.html" title="">about 55 percent</a> over the past several years, remain in favor of the death penalty for convicted murderers, half no longer believe it is used fairly. The Gallup Crime Survey, which has been testing opinions on this subject of fairness since 2000, found in last October’s sampling that for the first time, more Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/513806/new-low-say-death-penalty-fairly-applied.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">believed the death penalty was applied unfairly</a> (50 percent) than fairly (47 percent).</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>5:52</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>‘I Am So Sorry’: Meeting the Man I Put on Death Row</h2><h4>“I regret deeply that we followed the easiest path.”</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“This is death row. And this man doesn’t have long to live.” “I haven’t seen him in more than 20 years.” “Good morning, Robert.” “Good morning to you, Brian. Brian or Mr. Wharton?” “Brian’s fine.” “OK.” “Let me just say, I am so sorry that you’re here and so sorry that you are still here.” “Yes, sir.” “It’s our failure.” “Yes, sir.” “It truly is. But he’s never been far from my mind. Why? Because I helped put him here, and he didn’t deserve it.” “In 2002, I was the chief detective in the police department in Palestine, Texas. A 2-year-old girl was fighting for her life. Her name was Nikki. She had been brought to the hospital by her father, Robert Roberson.” “Roberson told staff they were sleeping in their Palestine home when he woke up and saw Nikki unresponsive, having fallen off the bed.” “When I got to the hospital, Robert wasn’t showing any emotion. His daughter is dying, but he doesn’t seem to care. The medical staff were talking to me about shaken baby syndrome. That’s when an infant is killed or injured after being violently shaken. Nikki would die the following day. If she died of shaken baby syndrome, then there was only one person who could be responsible. So we arrested Robert. He was tried, convicted of murder and sent to death row.” “That was two decades ago. Since then, I have left police work and entered the ministry. But I’ve never been able to forget Robert Roberson. This case has been a burden on my heart and my spirit. Let me just say that you have never been far from me. And I’m convinced we did the wrong thing.” “I think if it would have been properly investigated more, we wouldn’t be here sitting here now, probably.” “No other possibilities for her injury were considered. I regret deeply that we followed the easiest path.” “It was bad enough being — losing her, right?” “Yes, sir.” “I would do anything, anything now to bring her back,” “I would occasionally check this website to track his status. When I’d see his name, I’m thinking to myself, ‘Good. Somebody’s still working with him through the appeals process. An appeal has got to straighten this out, find the truth.’” “I tried to move on. I would comfort myself and say, ‘Look, the system did what the system does. He’s got an attorney. He got his Miranda warnings. We went by the book. He’s where he’s supposed to be.’ But several years ago, someone appeared at my door. It was Robert’s attorney. And I told her, ‘I’ve been expecting you.’ Sadly, I guess it took her appearing at my front door for me to find my voice again. I now understand that Robert did, in fact, have autism.” “It’s hard for me to express myself certain things and stuff. I had lots of things I was going to talk to you about. But sometimes, you get wordless — wordless and stuff.” “I understand, yeah. Autism would explain Robert’s flat affect and lack of emotion in the hospital. It’s absolutely insane that this never came up in his trial. I’ve now come to understand that Nikki was a very sick child and that some of those medical issues could have very easily played into the injuries that ultimately killed her. And shaken baby syndrome, it’s been substantially discredited by many in the medical community. Not only is there reasonable doubt that Robert did do it, there is unassailable doubt that Robert did do it. But for us at the time, we really felt like we were doing the right thing.” “Yes, sir.” “What do you want to say to me — me and the folks that helped put you here?” “I’d like to let you all know, I’ll forgive y’all and stuff. Forgive y’all and stuff. And I just hope and pray that we can make things right together.” “Yeah, I hope so, too. And I appreciate your forgiveness. It means a lot to me. We as human beings are incapable of producing the kind of fairness and justice required to take someone’s life. We can’t do it. And since we can’t do it every time in the same way, justly and fairly, then we don’t need to be doing it at all in the United States and certainly in the great state of Texas. We need to abolish the death penalty.” “And thank you, Brian.” “I’m praying for you, brother.” “I’m praying for you, too, brother.” “Humans are too fallible to do this fairly. We make mistakes. I made a big mistake. It’s a weight I will carry for the rest of my life.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/16/autossell/16x9_THUMB_WHARTON_ng/16x9_THUMB_WHARTON_ng-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">“I regret deeply that we followed the easiest path.”</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This editorial board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/capital-punishment-death-penalty.html" title="">has long argued</a> that the death penalty should be outlawed, as it is in Western Europe and many other parts of the world. Studies have consistently shown, for decades, that the ultimate penalty is applied <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/capital-punishment-death-penalty.html" title="">arbitrarily</a>, and <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/race/race-and-the-death-penalty-by-the-numbers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disproportionately</a> to Black people and people with mental problems. A death sentence condemns prisoners to many years of waiting, often in solitary confinement, before they are killed, and executions have often gone awry, arguably violating the Eighth <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-viii/clauses/103#:~:text=If%20a%20punishment%20is%20significantly,violation%2C%20but%20not%20for%20murder." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amendment ban on “cruel and unusual punishment.”</a></p><p>But the death penalty is still on the books at the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/federal-death-penalty" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal level</a>, as well as in <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-landing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">27 states</a>. Mr. Biden’s Justice Department ordered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/us/politics/executions-pause-merrick-garland.html" title="">moratorium</a> on federal executions in 2021, putting a pause on the practice after the Trump administration carried out <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-executions-biden-death-penalty-brandon-bernard-c1b26807c5c40b337d14485c3d6df2de" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13 federal executions in its last six months</a>. The moratorium is not a ban; it was intended only to study the protocols used for the practice. So even after the moratorium on carrying out federal executions was put in place, federal prosecutors decided to seek the death penalty for the perpetrator of the racist attack at a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/nyregion/payton-gendron-buffalo-death-penalty.html" title="">Buffalo supermarket in 2022</a>.</p><p><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-penalty-on-hold-in-most-of-the-country" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some states</a> have imposed moratoriums on executions because the predominant method, lethal injection, has been botched so many times. Others are searching for new modes of killing. The most notorious of the 13 executions so far this year, that of Kenneth Smith on Jan. 25 in Alabama, was a result of the state’s recent experiment with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/us/alabama-nitrogen-execution-kenneth-smith-witnesses.html" title="">asphyxiation by nitrogen</a> gas.</p><p>When Mr. Smith was first scheduled to die, in 2022, the prison’s execution team was unable to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/us/alabama-execution-kenneth-smith.html" title="">insert the IV for a lethal injection</a>, adding to the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/botched-executions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lengthy list of bungled executions</a> by that method. Problems in administering lethal injections and the difficulty in procuring the necessary chemicals had prompted officials in some states to explore a new method of execution. In Alabama, Mr. Smith was chosen to test it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Whether Mr. Smith was guilty of committing a terrible crime is not in question; he was sentenced to death for the brutal murder of Elizabeth Sennett in 1988. The question is whether death by asphyxiation is what Americans in Alabama and elsewhere should accept as justice and humanity in the 21st century.</p><p>Nitrogen hypoxia was promoted by Alabama as a more humane way to put a person to death, and it initially looked as if it would be widely embraced. Oklahoma, Mississippi and Louisiana have authorized the new method, Ohio is preparing to join them, and officials in Nebraska are considering it.</p><p>But then, all the other methods used in the United States over the last three centuries — gallows, firing squad, electric chair, gas chamber and lethal injection, which is currently the most common method — were also promoted as humane. One witness to Mr. Smith’s death reported that he writhed and heaved in apparent agony for several minutes before he died.</p><p>Nitrogen hypoxia is also running into the same problem executioners have faced in securing the drugs needed for lethal injections. In March, the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/three-largest-nitrogen-gas-manufacturers-in-the-u-s-prohibit-products-from-use-in-executions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three biggest manufacturers of nitrogen gas</a> in the United States pledged not to sell their products for use in executions. These companies, like the pharmaceutical companies that refuse to provide the drugs used in lethal injections, are right to take this principled stand, as are the medical practitioners precluded by professional ethics from participating in executions.</p><p>States are finding ways around the problem, mainly by passing laws to keep their suppliers of lethal drugs and other products <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/lethal-injection-death-penalty-drugmakers-opposition/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secret</a>. That’s what <a href="https://dpic-cdn.org/production/legacy/SecrecyReport.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South Carolina</a> has done, and the state has scheduled what would be its <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-execution-freddie-ownes-b93bb1f77c8875af170310f9a556d92d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first execution in 13 years</a> for Sept. 20. The condemned man, Freddie Eugene Owens, has been given the choice of how to die — by lethal injection, electrocution or the newly added option of a firing squad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Americans who believe that these punishments have no place in a modern system of criminal justice can urge lawmakers in the states where execution is still legal to ban it altogether. In the several states where it is still regularly in use, voters can demand stricter limits, such as a requirement that a prisoner cannot be subject to the punishment a second time, after a botched attempt, as Mr. Smith was. Alabama was the last state that <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/alabama-appeals-court-reverses-lower-court-ruling-and-restores-death-sentence-in-case-in-which-10-of-12-jurors-voted-for-life" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allowed judges to impose the death penalty</a> even when a jury had ruled otherwise. That was the case for Mr. Smith, who was sentenced to life in prison by the jury in his second trial, a decision that was overruled by a judge.</p><p>There are executive actions Mr. Biden could take in the absence of federal or state legislation to abolish the death penalty, including directing the Justice Department not to pursue the death penalty in pending and future cases and commuting the death sentences of those currently on federal death row. He could also order the demolition of the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/federal-death-penalty/background-on-the-federal-death-penalty" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal execution chamber</a> in Terre Haute, Ind., as those opposed to the death penalty have urged him to do. And by promoting new federal legislation he could restart an important conversation in American society about ending the death penalty. Even if its chances of passage were unlikely, the discussion around it and in the wider public would have value.</p><p>Until this year, the American justice system seemed firmly on course away from the death penalty. Mr. Biden was right to identify capital punishment as a moral affront, and he should help relegate this practice to history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Source photograph by Savany, via Getty Images.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
