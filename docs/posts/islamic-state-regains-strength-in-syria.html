But it could also reverberate more broadly, spreading instability through the Middle East. The extremist group once used Syria as a base to plan attacks on the country’s neighbors and further abroad in Europe.</p><p>Between 9,000 and 10,000 Islamic State fighters and about 40,000 of their family members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/world/middleeast/isis-prison-syria-jail.html" title="">are detaine</a>d in northeastern Syria. Their escape would not only add to the group’s numbers, but also provide a propaganda coup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The crown jewel for the Islamic State is still the prisons and camps,” said Colin Clarke, the head of research for the Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security firm.</p><p>“That’s where the experienced, battle-hardened fighters are,” he said. “In addition to whatever muscle they add to the group, if those prisons are open, the pure propaganda value” would serve the group’s recruitment efforts for months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Masked guards in the Al-Sina prison." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk/00int-isis-syria-02-bplk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/97ddc3cc-c8a7-579e-95f1-8952a87c4485" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Masked guards in an Al-Sina Prison corridor leading to the cells of Islamic State fighters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Top U.S. intelligence officials last month presented to Congress their annual worldwide threat assessment, concluding that the Islamic State would try to exploit the end of the Assad government to free prisoners and to revive its ability to plot and carry out attacks.</p><p>The United States announced late last year that its military had roughly doubled the number of its troops on the ground in Syria, to 2,000, and its many strikes on Islamic State redoubts in the Syrian desert in the last few months appear to have tamped down the immediate threat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But President Trump has expressed deep <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/trump-syria-rebels.html" title="">skepticism about keeping U.S. troops in the country</a>, and a confluence of other developments in Syria has alarmed experts who say that, taken together, they could make it easier for the Islamic State to regroup further.</p><p>The United States has hopes that the new Syrian government, led by a onetime Al Qaeda affiliate, Hayat Tahrir al Sham, will become a partner against a resurgent Islamic State. The initial signs were positive, with the group acting on U.S.-provided intelligence to disrupt eight Islamic State plots in Damascus, according to two senior U.S. military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations.</p><p>But sectarian-driven violence last month, in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/middleeast/syria-violence.html" title="">hundreds of civilians were killed</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/middleeast/syria-military-assad.html" title="">showed the government’s lack of control</a> over some forces nominally under its command, and it is unclear how much bandwidth it will have to fight the Islamic State.</p><p>The Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim insurgent group, traces its beginnings to Al Qaeda in Iraq, where it was defeated by local militias and American troops. Its fighters rebranded as the Islamic State and exploited the chaos of Syria’s civil war to seize vast swaths of territory and return to Iraq.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It gained notoriety for kidnappings, sexual enslavement and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-james-foley-syria-execution.html" title="">public executions</a>, and orchestrated or inspired a series of terrorist attacks across Europe. The group had largely been routed more than five ago by a combination of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in northeastern Syria and U.S. troops. But by early 2024, the Assad regime was increasingly on the defensive; its Iranian and Russian allies were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-iran-russia.html" title="">stretched by conflicts elsewhere</a>; and Syria’s Kurds were forced to divert troops to battle Turkish attacks.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish-led Syrian defense forces battling what were the last remnants of Islamic State forces in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But, though it no longer holds much territory, the Islamic State is still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/middleeast/isis-propaganda-new-orleans-attack.html" title="">spreading its radical ideology</a> through clandestine cells and regional affiliates outside of Syria and online. Last year, the group was behind <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/middleeast/us-isis-iran-general-suleimani.html" title="">major attacks in Iran</a>, Russia and Pakistan.</p><p>In Syria, according to a U.S. defense department official who spoke anonymously to discuss information that has not yet been released publicly, the group claimed 294 attacks in 2024, up from the 121 it claimed in 2023. The United Nations’ Islamic State monitoring committee estimated about 400 attacks, while human rights observers in Syria said the number was even higher.</p><p>Attacks so far this year appear to have slowed, according to human rights groups and U.S. military officials — in part because of the recent U.S. bombing campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/middleeast/islamic-state-leader-killed-iraq-us.html" title="">targeting Islamic State fighters</a> — but it is still relatively early in the year and the situation hangs on a knife’s edge.</p><p>Aaron Zelin, a Washington Institute fellow who has tracked Islamist groups’ activities and propaganda for more than 15 years, said the unrest facing the new government from remnants of the Assad regime and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/middleeast/turkey-kurds-deadly-airstrikes.html" title="">incursions by Turkey</a> into Syria were its biggest challenges right now. But he warned that the Islamic State added yet another threat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“One big attack in Damascus against foreigners or expats and everybody’s going to change how they view it, so we need to be cautious,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Al Hol camp where the wives and children of Islamic State fighters have been held for years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The concerns over a possible prison escape by Islamic State detainees have been heightened by ongoing violence in the northeast. The detention centers in northeastern Syria are guarded by the Kurdish-led fighters, the Syrian Democratic Forces, who also help guard the nearby camps that hold Islamic State family members. But those forces have been distracted by attacks from Turkish-backed militias.</p><p>The Turkish authorities view the Kurdish-led fighters as the Syrian branch of Kurdish separatists in Turkey who have waged a 40-year battle against the Turkish government. Turkey sees them as terrorists.</p><p>The prisons have already proven to be a concern. In 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/world/middleeast/syria-prison-isis-boys.html" title="">nearly 400</a> Islamic State-linked prisoners escaped during an Islamic State assault on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/world/middleeast/isis-prison-syria.html" title="">a prison</a> in the city of Hasaka. At the time, U.S. Special Operations forces helped the Syrian Democratic Forces get control of the situation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish special forces conducted house-to-house searches for escaped prisoners and ISIS fighters in Hasaka in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Since then, U.S. intelligence on potential jail breaks has helped the Syrian Democratic Forces disrupt other plots before they happened, one of the senior U.S. officials said.</p><p>In Al Hol, the largest camp where Islamic State women and children have been held for years, the extremist group has been testing the boundaries.
