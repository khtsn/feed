But it could also reverberate more broadly, spreading instability through the Middle East. The extremist group once used Syria as a base to plan attacks on the country’s neighbors and further abroad in Europe.</p><p>Between 9,000 and 10,000 Islamic State fighters and about 40,000 of their family members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/world/middleeast/isis-prison-syria-jail.html" title="">are detaine</a>d in northeastern Syria.

The initial signs were positive, with the group acting on U.S.-provided intelligence to disrupt eight Islamic State plots in Damascus, according to two senior U.S. military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations.</p><p>But sectarian-driven violence last month, in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/middleeast/syria-violence.html" title="">hundreds of civilians were killed</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/middleeast/syria-military-assad.html" title="">showed the government’s lack of control</a> over some forces nominally under its command, and it is unclear how much bandwidth it will have to fight the Islamic State.</p><p>The Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim insurgent group, traces its beginnings to Al Qaeda in Iraq, where it was defeated by local militias and American troops. Its fighters rebranded as the Islamic State and exploited the chaos of Syria’s civil war to seize vast swaths of territory and return to Iraq.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It gained notoriety for kidnappings, sexual enslavement and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-james-foley-syria-execution.html" title="">public executions</a>, and orchestrated or inspired a series of terrorist attacks across Europe. The group had largely been routed more than five ago by a combination of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in northeastern Syria and U.S. troops. But by early 2024, the Assad regime was increasingly on the defensive; its Iranian and Russian allies were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-iran-russia.html" title="">stretched by conflicts elsewhere</a>; and Syria’s Kurds were forced to divert troops to battle Turkish attacks.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish-led Syrian defense forces battling what were the last remnants of Islamic State forces in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But, though it no longer holds much territory, the Islamic State is still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/middleeast/isis-propaganda-new-orleans-attack.html" title="">spreading its radical ideology</a> through clandestine cells and regional affiliates outside of Syria and online. Last year, the group was behind <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/middleeast/us-isis-iran-general-suleimani.html" title="">major attacks in Iran</a>, Russia and Pakistan.</p><p>In Syria, according to a U.S. defense department official who spoke anonymously to discuss information that has not yet been released publicly, the group claimed 294 attacks in 2024, up from the 121 it claimed in 2023. The United Nations’ Islamic State monitoring committee estimated about 400 attacks, while human rights observers in Syria said the number was even higher.</p><p>Attacks so far this year appear to have slowed, according to human rights groups and U.S. military officials — in part because of the recent U.S. bombing campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/world/middleeast/islamic-state-leader-killed-iraq-us.html" title="">targeting Islamic State fighters</a> — but it is still relatively early in the year and the situation hangs on a knife’s edge.</p><p>Aaron Zelin, a Washington Institute fellow who has tracked Islamist groups’ activities and propaganda for more than 15 years, said the unrest facing the new government from remnants of the Assad regime and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/world/middleeast/turkey-kurds-deadly-airstrikes.html" title="">incursions by Turkey</a> into Syria were its biggest challenges right now.
