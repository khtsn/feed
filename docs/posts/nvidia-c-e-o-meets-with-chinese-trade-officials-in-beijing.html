He also met with He Lifeng, China’s vice premier for economic policy.</p><p>The visit was <a href="https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?item_id=3051873875832864953&amp;source=50001&amp;sub_source=50001_006" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">covered by Chinese state media</a>, which reported that Mr. Huang said U.S. controls on Nvidia’s sales to China had a significant impact on the company’s business. Nvidia, the report <a href="https://weibo.com/2258727970/PnGZlp959" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, would “continue to spare no effort” to make products that comply with regulations and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.”</p><p>Mr. Huang headed to Beijing during a week when his company’s relationship with Washington has fluctuated dramatically.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Monday, Nvidia promised to invest $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-effect-nvidia-leads-american-made-chips-boom/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">winning praise from President Trump’s administration</a>, which called the investment “the Trump Effect in action.”</p><p>The next day, the company disclosed that U.S. officials said it would need a license for any sales to China. The new requirement would force Nvidia to take a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/nvidia-h20-chip-china-restrictions.html" title="">$5.5 billion hit on inventory</a> it had already planned to sell in China.</p><p>On Wednesday, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which focuses on national security threats from China, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/technology/nvidia-deepseek-china-ai-trump.html" title="">said it was investigating Nvidia’s sales</a> of chips across Asia. The committee is trying to determine if the chip maker knowingly violated U.S. rules on chip sales to Chinese companies, especially to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html" title="">A.I. startup DeepSeek</a>.</p><p>Nvidia has become one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/technology/nvidia-most-valuable-company.html" title="">world’s most valuable companies</a> on the strength of booming demand for its advanced chips, which are needed to power artificial intelligence systems. Its share price was down 6 percent on Wednesday following news of the investigation.</p><p>“We regularly meet with government leaders to discuss our company’s products and technology,” a company spokeswoman said on Thursday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Tech companies across China have scrambled to acquire as many of Nvidia’s powerful chips as possible as the United States has ratcheted up controls on sales of advanced chips to China. Some companies built up huge stockpiles. Others turned to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/technology/china-ai-microchips.html" title="">thriving black market</a> for smuggled chips.</p><p>The U.S. government’s efforts to keep advanced chips out of China’s hands were started under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>In 2022, the Biden administration imposed rules to curb the export of Nvidia’s most powerful chips to China. Nvidia responded by modifying one of its leading A.I. chips so its capabilities fell below U.S. government thresholds. The resulting chip, called the H20, became a China-specific product.</p><p>Washington’s controls on chip exports have made it increasingly difficult for Nvidia to do business in China. China accounted for $17 billion in revenue for Nvidia during its last fiscal year, by percentage the smallest portion in over a decade, according to Bernstein Research. Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported $130 billion</a> in global revenue during its last fiscal year, an increase of 114 percent over the year before.</p><p>A few weeks ago, Mr. Huang <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/nvidia-h20-chip-china-restrictions.html" title="">met with President Trump</a> in Mar-a-Lago at a dinner that cost $1 million per person.</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research from Beijing, and <!-- -->Amy Chang Chien<!-- --> from Taipei, Taiwan.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
