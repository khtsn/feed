Mr. Jneed said his family had already been displaced at least six times since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">war began in October 2023</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Displacement means death, humiliation, homelessness,” Mr. Jneed added.</p><p>Mr. Jneed is likely to be among the first affected by Israel’s plan to capture large sections of Gaza and force those living there to move south. The Israeli authorities said on Monday that they were calling up tens of thousands of military reservists to enact the expansion of the war. Israeli leaders say they hope that the campaign will pressure Hamas to compromise in stalled cease-fire negotiations, and release the hostages it still holds in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israeli troops deploying at a position near the border with the Gaza on Monday.

A Hamas spokesman <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgq22lzn3no" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Tuesday</a> that the group was no longer interested in participating in cease-fire negotiations.</p><p>All of this has contributed to a deeper sense of gloom among Gazan civilians. Wafa al-Ghouty, 35, an accountant and mother of five, said she had been displaced seven times since the start of the war. She is now sheltering in a tent in a coastal area of southern Gaza.</p><p>“The situation is extremely challenging, not just because of the repeated displacement, but because of the hunger and the helplessness of not being able to provide even a loaf of bread,” Ms. al-Ghouty said in an interview. “Every time we settle, we are forced to move again.”</p><p>Ms. Al-Ghouty said she planned to cook her last bag of pasta within 24 hours. “Sometimes we’re so focused on surviving — finding food and medicine for the children — that we miss the news,” she said. “But this announcement hit like a thunderbolt.” She said she had already packed a small bag with her children’s clothes and key documents, bracing for what may come next.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A charity kitchen in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, in April.

The renewed assault has brought near-daily airstrikes and escalating ground operations, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries. According to the United Nations, more than 1.9 million people — the majority of Gaza’s population — have been displaced since the war began.</p><p>The humanitarian situation has worsened significantly in recent weeks because of Israel’s blockade on aid supplies. Most bakeries are no longer operational, food stocks are depleted and medical supplies are critically low. Israel has argued that its blockade is lawful, and that Gaza still has enough available provisions.</p><p>Mr. Jneed said he was struggling to provide basic necessities for his two children. The family now survives on just one meal a day.</p><p>“Every hour that passes is worse than the one before,” he said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
