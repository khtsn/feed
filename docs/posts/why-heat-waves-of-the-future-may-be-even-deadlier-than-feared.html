Heat killed 60,000 people in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Europe</a> alone in 2022, and at least 55,000 people in <a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2014/05000/mortality_related_to_air_pollution_with_the_moscow.6.aspx#:~:text=The%20initial%20death%20toll%20estimate%20for%20the,part%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation.15%20However%2C%20data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russia</a> in 2010. Now, growing research suggests that humans may be more vulnerable to rising temperatures than scientists had previously believed.</p><p>“It’s scary as hell,” said Matthew Huber, director of the Institute for a Sustainable Future at Purdue University.</p><p>In 2010, Dr. Huber and Steven Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales in Australia, first <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0913352107" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed</a> a limit to how much heat the body could handle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>They knew that humidity impedes evaporation and reduces the body’s ability to cool itself by sweating. And sweat is critical: It’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7662600/#:~:text=In%20humans%2C%20evaporative%20heat%20loss,6%2C104%2C105%5D." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responsible</a> for up to 80 percent of heat loss from the body. So the researchers turned to a measurement that accounts for this effect, called wet bulb temperature, or Tw.</p><p>A wet bulb thermometer is essentially a thermometer wrapped in a damp wad of cotton. As water evaporates it cools the bulb, which makes it a convenient proxy for the way that sweating cools the body.</p><p>Reasoning from basic physiological principles, they concluded that a Tw of 35 degrees Celsius would be the limit of human heat tolerance. That figure is more extreme than it sounds, because it accounts for humidity as well as heat. It translates to about <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/wet-bulb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">103</a> degrees Fahrenheit with 75 percent humidity, or <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-heat-records-fall-how-hot-is-too-hot-for-the-human-body-210088" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">115</a> Fahrenheit with 50 percent humidity.</p><p>These conditions are rare. Because air carries more water vapor as it warms, it is unusual to reach such high levels of humidity at those temperatures. Still, beyond this threshold, the body’s cooling mechanisms begin to fail, and core temperature starts to rise. The onset of heat stroke becomes a matter of time.</p><p>Heat is dangerous at far lower wet bulb temperatures, too. But that 35 Celsius level was absolute, Dr. Huber and Dr. Sherwood concluded — the point at which even a healthy young person, in the shade, with unlimited water, would succumb in about six hours.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the time, sustained heat waves so severe were thought to have never occurred. Dr. Huber and Dr. Sherwood predicted that these conditions could emerge with five to seven degrees Celsius of global warming, compared with preindustrial levels, “calling the habitability of some regions into question.”</p><p>Although the chances of that much warming are remote, the conclusion was still alarming. The New Scientist <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827835-600-thermogeddon-when-the-earth-gets-too-hot-for-humans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> it Thermogeddon.</p><p>In 2018, researchers using updated climate models found that China, without large reductions in emissions, could regularly be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05252-y" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exposed</a> to the human limit by 2070. By the end of the century, so, too, might the Persian Gulf, India and Southeast Asia.</p><p>All told, nearly two billion people might face temperatures that the body cannot tolerate for long. Mortality from extreme heat could <a href="http://www.impactlab.org/news-insights/global-death-rate-from-rising-temperatures/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surpass</a> that of all infectious diseases combined, and rival that of cancer and heart disease.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>A wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius quickly became an understood guardrail among scientists, an edge that humanity must not cross.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A temperature reading at a church in Woodland Hills, Calif., on Sept. 5.

One author of the paper <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2020/05/08/fatal-heat-humidity-emerging/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> that “we may be closer to a real tipping point on this than we think.”</p><p>And there’s a bigger problem with that accepted limit. “It’s not real,” said Larry Kenney, a professor of physiology at Penn State.</p><p>The wet bulb limit was always theoretical, rather than experimental, he added: “Humans don’t sweat like a thermometer.” In fact, our physical tolerance for heat may be lower.</p><p>In 2021, Dr. Kenney recruited 24 volunteers to swallow a capsule thermometer and climb into a heat chamber as his graduate students dialed up the temperature inside. What they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8799385/#B7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> was surprising.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The threshold for maximum heat tolerance actually was about a wet bulb temperature of 31 Celsius. “That’s the limit for all comers,” he said. Above that, “core temperature does this,” he said, tracing a line with his finger toward the ceiling.</p><p>I took a spin through the heat chamber myself. Afterward, a graduate student showed me a graph of my temperature, measured by the tiny thermometer I had swallowed that morning in Dr. Kenney’s office.</p><p>After a few minutes in the chamber, my temperature rose gently before plateauing. This reflected my body’s adaptive mechanisms kicking in. But then, after about 45 minutes at Tw 31 Celsius, the line on the graph kicked up again and kept rising.</p><p>Slowly but surely, I was accumulating more heat than I could get rid of. The line was still rising when the grad students killed the heat and brought me out of the chamber.</p><p>“This is a best-case scenario, with young healthy people,” Dan Vecellio, one of Dr. Kenney’s colleagues, said of my results. “We’ve also done this work with older people, and the threshold is lower.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>During the heat wave in Europe in 2022, nearly 60 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">percent</a> of deaths occurred among people over 80. Since Dr. Kenney published his initial results, researchers at the University of Sydney have issued <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43121-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">corroboration</a>: They found that the limit may be as low as a wet bulb temperature of 22 Celsius among older participants.</p><p>If the actual limit of human heat tolerance is less than Tw 35 Celsius, then the threat of lethal heat may be greater than believed. Last October, Dr. Kenney’s team collaborated with Dr. Huber to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2305427120" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publish</a> a paper mapping the new, lower threshold onto climate projections.</p><p>They found that sustained exposure to a wet bulb temperature of 31 Celsius was limited below 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Global surface temperatures have so far <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/?intent=121" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased</a> by about 1.4 Celsius (roughly 2.5 Fahrenheit) since the preindustrial era.</p><p>But the pace of warming is expected to accelerate, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href="https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/the-ipcc-just-published-its-summary-of-5-years-of-reports-heres-what-you-need-to-know/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">projecting</a> a rise of three degrees Celsius by 2100 under current climate policies. Above two degrees, lethal heat waves might rapidly emerge in some of the world’s most densely populated regions, including eastern China, India and sub-Saharan Africa, according to Dr. Kenney and his colleagues.</p><p>If warming were to exceed four degrees, these conditions would begin to affect Southeast Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South America, and several American cities, including Chicago, Houston and Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At that level of warming, three billion people could be exposed to at least a week of temperatures at the human limit every year, Dr. Kenney said. Some 1.5 billion could experience a month of such conditions, and several hundred million could experience “an entire season” of “life-altering extreme heat.”</p><p>“These results indicate that a significant portion of the world’s population will experience — for the first time in human history — prolonged exposures to uncompensable extreme moist heat,” he and his colleagues wrote in the study.</p><p>Some uncertainty remains — the human research is still in an early stage, and the amount of warming the planet will experience remains unknown.</p><p>“We have to remember that people are already dying in the heat well before we reach these thresholds,” Dr. Vecellio said. Over a thousand people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/world/australia/record-heat-deaths-events.html" title="">died</a> this year during the hajj in Saudi Arabia, he pointed out.</p><p>Dr. Vecellio noted that holding global warming to two degrees Celsius largely avoids the truly catastrophic heat waves predicted by their models. “We obviously want to not even get to two degrees Celsius,” he said. “But two degrees Celsius is, like — that’s it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
