The company’s current fact-checking system, he added, had “reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.”</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg noted that “recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.”</p><p>Elon Musk has relied on Community Notes to flag misleading posts on X. Since taking over the social network, Mr. Musk, a major Trump donor, has increasingly positioned X as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/technology/elon-musk-trump-x.html" title="">the platform behind the new Trump presidency</a>.</p><p>Meta’s move is likely to please the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump and its conservative allies, many of whom have disliked Meta’s practice of adding disclaimers or warnings to questionable or false posts. Mr. Trump has long railed against Mr. Zuckerberg, claiming the fact-checking feature treated posts by conservative users unfairly.</p><p>Since Mr. Trump won a second term in November, Meta has moved swiftly to try to repair the strained relationships he and his company have with conservatives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In late November, Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-trump-meeting.html" title="">Mar-a-Lago</a>, where he also met with his secretary of state pick, Marco Rubio. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/meta-trump-inaugural-fund-donation.html" title="">Meta donated $1 million</a> to support Mr. Trump’s inauguration in December. Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/technology/meta-joel-kaplan-nick-clegg.html" title="">Mr. Zuckerberg elevated Joel Kaplan</a>, a longtime conservative and the highest ranking Meta executive closest to the Republican Party, to the company’s most senior policy role. And on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/technology/dana-white-meta-board-ufc.html" title="">Dana White</a>, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close ally of Mr. Trump, would join Meta’s board.</p><p>Meta executives recently gave a heads-up to Trump officials about the change in policy, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity. The fact-checking announcement coincided with an appearance on “Fox &amp; Friends” by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/technology/meta-joel-kaplan-nick-clegg.html" title="">Mr. Kaplan</a>, a favorite show of Mr. Trump. He told the hosts of the morning show popular with conservatives that there was “too much political bias” in the fact-checking program, and that the changes would result in “way less over-enforcement” of content.</p><p>The change brings an end to a practice the company started eight years ago, in the weeks after Mr. Trump’s election in 2016. At the time, Facebook was under fire for the unchecked dissemination of misinformation spread across its network, including posts from foreign governments angling to sow discord among the American public.</p><p>As a result of enormous public pressure, Mr. Zuckerberg turned to outside organizations like The Associated Press, ABC News and the fact-checking site Snopes, along with other global organizations vetted by the International Fact-Checking Network, to comb over potentially false or misleading posts on Facebook and Instagram and rule whether they needed to be annotated or removed.</p><p>Among the changes, Mr. Zuckerberg said, will be to “remove restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are out of touch with mainstream discourse.” He also said that the trust and safety and content moderation teams would be moved from California, with the U.S. content review shifting to Texas. That would “help remove the concern than biased employees are overly censoring content,” <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DEhga1cJGjg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he added</a>.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering campaign finance and the influence of billionaires in American politics.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/theodore-schleifer">More about Theodore Schleifer</a></span></p></div><div><p>Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco.
