One document described recent exercises that appeared to rehearse elements of a strike, while the second details how Israel is shifting the placement of its missiles and weapons in case Iran responds another strike.

Israel could try to balance its strategic goals after severely weakening Iran’s proxy forces — Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza — with concerns from its allies, particularly the United States, that a new attack could set off a wider regional war.</p><p>The Israeli government has told the Biden administration that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-news#israel-tells-the-us-that-it-wont-target-nuclear-sites-during-its-initial-retaliation-against-iran-officials-say" title="">it will avoid striking Iran’s nuclear enrichment and oil production sites</a>, two officials said. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said that Israel had agreed to focus its attack on military targets in Iran.</p><p>Avoiding nuclear or oil infrastructure sites would reduce the likelihood of an all-out war between the two adversaries, amid concerns in Washington over being dragged into a bigger Middle East confrontation with the presidential election less than two weeks away.</p><h2 id="link-74d0a97d">What are Israel’s military capabilities?</h2><p>If Israel wants to use its powerful air force to retaliate, its planes would have to fly long distances.

Western and Iranian officials said that Israel had deployed aerial drones and at least one missile fired from a warplane in that attack.</p><p>That strike showed that Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/world/middleeast/iran-israel-strike-tensions.html" title="">could bypass Iran’s defensive systems</a> and paralyze them.</p><p>“I think it’s likely they’ll mimic the April operation and try to take out Iran’s early warning systems and air defenses to make way for an air attack,” said Grant Rumley, a former Pentagon official and a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in an earlier interview. “The question will be how extensive and whether they’ll go into Iranian airspace.”</p><p>According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, Israel also has other options: <a href="https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/jericho-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jericho 2</a> medium-range ballistic missiles that can fly about 2,000 miles, and <a href="https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/jericho-3/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jericho 3</a> intermediate-range ballistic missiles that can reach targets more than 4,000 miles away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-40002158">What is the U.S. government’s stance?</h2><p>President Biden said this month he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-weapons-biden-israel.html" title="">would not support</a> an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.</p><p>Mr. Biden replied in the affirmative last week when asked whether he knew when Israel would strike, and what kind of targets it had chosen.
