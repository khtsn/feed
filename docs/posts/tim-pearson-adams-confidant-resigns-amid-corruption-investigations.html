Here is a closer look at the charges against Mr. Adams and how people with ties to him are related to the inquiries.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some members of the Adams administration had for weeks been pressing for the resignations of Mr. Pearson and others whose phones had been seized.</p><p>Mr. Adams hired Mr. Pearson in 2022 as a senior adviser with a $243,000 salary, even though Mr. Pearson was at the time also working a job at a Queens casino as its vice president for public safety. In that position, he was earning between $250,000 and $500,000 a year, city records show.</p><p>State law precludes officials employed by conventional city agencies from simultaneously collecting city pensions. But Mr. Adams put Mr. Pearson on the payroll of a city-run nonprofit, the Economic Development Corporation, which allowed him to also keep the $124,000 Police Department pension he was collecting.</p><p>At the time of his hiring, Mr. Pearson’s other employer, Resorts World New York City, was seeking support from New York City for a bid to expand its casino operations in Queens, an apparent conflict of interest that City Hall sought to dispel by saying that Mr. Pearson’s responsibilities did not touch on casinos.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Four days after The New York Times reported on Mr. Pearson’s unusual employment situation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/14/nyregion/adams-pearson-casino.html" title="">he left the job with the casino</a>.</p><p>Mr. Pearson’s lawyer, Hugh H. Mo, said in a statement that news reports in recent months contained “false and defamatory allegations” against his client that were not supported by the facts, but he did not single out a specific report or otherwise provide details.</p><p>Mr. Pearson “is committed to clearing his name, and is confident that once all the facts have been brought to light, these allegations will be proven to have no merit,” the statement said.</p><p>Mr. Pearson’s resignation letter cited his 30 years in the Police Department and 11 years in the private sector at Resorts World.</p><p>“During my tenure, I played a critical role in ensuring quality assurance for migrant services and security issues, with particular oversight of shelter sites and migrant contracts, with a focus on keeping costs down for the City,” the letter said. “I also contributed to advising you on new technology and matters related to the N.Y.P.D.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Those aspects of his work are under scrutiny as part of the federal investigation that resulted in the seizure of this phones, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.</p><p>Mr. Adams declined to comment on Mr. Pearson’s resignation during an appearance at Aliento de Vida Church in Queens on Monday night.</p><p>Later on Monday, his spokesman, Fabien Levy, issued a statement from Mr. Adams praising Mr. Pearson’s “long career in both the public and private sectors.”</p><p>Mr. Pearson, the statement said, “has spent over 30 years keeping New Yorkers safe. We appreciate Tim’s decades of service to this city and wish him well.”</p><p>After Mr. Pearson joined the administration, the mayor never clearly defined what Mr. Pearson’s responsibilities were, but subsequent reporting revealed that they included dealing with contracts tied to the housing of migrants at city shelters and interacting with the Police Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Pearson wielded near-absolute control over most discretionary promotions at the Police Department even though he held no formal role there, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/nypd-pearson-adams-lawsuit.html#:~:text=New%20York-,Sex%20Harassment%20Suit%20Is%20Fourth%20This%20Year%20for%20a%20Top,the%20New%20York%20Police%20Department." title="">a lawsuit filed by a veteran deputy police chief, Miltiadis Marmara</a>, in July.</p><p>Mr. Marmara was one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/nypd-pearson-adams-lawsuit.html#:~:text=New%20York-,Sex%20Harassment%20Suit%20Is%20Fourth%20This%20Year%20for%20a%20Top,the%20New%20York%20Police%20Department." title="">four subordinates of Mr. Pearson’s who filed sexual harassment suits</a> against him this year. Three of those suits, including Mr. Marmara’s, were filed by men who said they were appalled by Mr. Pearson’s treatment of female colleagues in a small unit overseen by Mr. Pearson.</p><p>Mr. Pearson has also been the subject of the two inquiries by the city’s independent Department of Investigation. One has focused on the sexual harassment allegations. The other has examined Mr. Pearson’s apparent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/nyregion/timothy-pearson-guards-migrants.html" title="">instigation of a brawl</a> at a Manhattan migrant center last fall, after the security guards there asked for Mr. Pearson’s identification, in keeping with protocol.</p><p>Mr. Pearson and Mr. Adams, a retired police captain, have been friends for more than 30 years. Mr. Pearson at one point served as Mr. Adams’s supervisor when he was on the force. And when Mr. Adams was sworn in as mayor in Times Square on Jan. 1, 2022, Mr. Pearson was one of only a handful of friends and family members who stood with him on the stage.</p><p>The mayor has consistently defended Mr. Pearson, arguing that he is an essential element of his administration and deserves due process.</p><p>“Tim,” the mayor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw4USHetMBQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in December, “is one of my Knights of the Round Table.”</p><p>Emma G.
