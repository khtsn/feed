    <h1>Tim Pearson, Adams Confidant, Resigns Amid Corruption Investigations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of Mayor Eric Adams’s closest aides and confidants resigned on Monday, less than a week after the mayor was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted.html" title="">indicted</a> on corruption charges and nearly a month after federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html" title="">seized</a> the aide’s phones <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">in a separate corruption inquiry</a>, according to a resignation letter his lawyer said had been sent to the mayor.</p><p>The aide, Timothy Pearson, had a broad portfolio that included dealing with contracts for migrant shelters. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/nyregion/nyc-resignations-banks-caban-adams.html" title="">is the fifth senior member of the mayor’s administration</a> to announce his departure in the past three weeks.</p><p>A retired Police Department inspector, Mr. Pearson is also a defendant in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/nypd-pearson-adams-lawsuit.html" title="">four sexual harassment lawsuits filed by subordinates</a>, and he is the subject of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/nyregion/timothy-pearson-guards-migrants.html" title="">two separate inquiries by the New York City Department of Investigation</a>. He was among the several senior administration officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html" title="">who had their phones seized by federal investigators</a> on Sept. 4.</p><p>Some members of the Adams administration had for weeks been pressing for Mr. Pearson to resign, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p></div></div>
