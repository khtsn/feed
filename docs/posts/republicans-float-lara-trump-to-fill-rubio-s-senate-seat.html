    <h1>Republicans Float Lara Trump to Fill Rubio’s Senate Seat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Senator Rick Scott, the Florida Republican who has presented himself as a champion of the MAGA right wing in the run-up to President-elect Donald J. Trump’s second term, threw his support behind Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, to replace his colleague Senator Marco Rubio.</p><p>“Lara Trump would be a GREAT Senator and represent Floridians well,” Mr. Scott, who lost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-senate-thune-cornyn-scott.html" title="">his bid to serve as majority leader this week</a>, wrote on social media on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Rubio on Wednesday to serve as his secretary of state, and, if confirmed, Mr. Rubio will have to step down from his Senate seat. Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida — who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/desantis-trump-humiliation.html" title="">suffered a humiliating defeat to Mr. Trump</a> in the party’s presidential primary race this year — has the power to appoint a replacement for Mr. Rubio until 2026, when a special election would be held for the final two years of Mr. Rubio’s term.</p><p>Ms. Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, said in an interview on Fox Business on Thursday that she had not spoken to Mr. DeSantis about appointing a replacement, but she nodded to support she had received from other Republican lawmakers, including <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/katie-britt-lara-trump-florida-senate-rubio" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senator Katie Britt of Alabama</a> and <a href="https://x.com/realannapaulina/status/1856368717728301479" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Representative Anna Paulina Luna of Florida</a>. “If this were something that I’m asked to do,” she said, “I would seriously consider it.”</p></div></div>
