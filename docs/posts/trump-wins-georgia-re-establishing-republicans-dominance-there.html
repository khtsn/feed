Trump won Georgia’s 16 electoral votes, according to a New York Times projection, flipping the swing state back to Republicans after Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s landmark victory there in 2020.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s victory in the state reaffirmed many conservatives’ beliefs that the Peach State is fundamentally red, despite Democrats’ inroads in recent election cycles. Mr. Trump sees Georgia and another key Sun Belt state, North Carolina, as crucial to his path back to the White House.</p><p>He made Georgia the center of his election grievances after losing the 2020 presidential contest, when he fell short by less than 12,000 votes in the state. He falsely claimed that Georgia’s election results were fraudulent after several recounts and pressured two of its most high-profile Republican leaders, Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia.html" title="">to “find” the votes he did not win</a>. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/14/us/trump-indictment-georgia-election" title="">was indicted in 2023</a> for his efforts to overturn the election results in the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Donald J.

Mr. Trump’s campaign and its allies also spent nearly $100 million on advertising in the state before Election Day.</p><p>Democrats, for their part, spent almost $130 million on the airwaves in Georgia, confident that a victory there would blunt Mr. Trump’s path back to the White House. Democrats ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html" title="">made some significant gains</a> in counties surrounding Atlanta, Georgia’s biggest city. In Henry County, southeast of Atlanta, Ms. Harris gained by more than 9 percentage points compared with Mr. Biden in 2020.</p><p>But Republicans made gains in every other part of the state — even in Democratic enclaves in the counties surrounding major cities such as Macon, Augusta and Savannah. In Clarke County, which encompasses the city of Athens, Mr. Trump gained by 4 points. Mr. Trump even gained slightly in some parts of Atlanta, including DeKalb County and Fulton County — where the former president was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/24/us/trump-georgia-surrender-indictment" title="">booked on racketeering charges</a> last year.</p><p>Chris Cameron<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya King is a politics reporter covering the Southeast, based in Atlanta.
