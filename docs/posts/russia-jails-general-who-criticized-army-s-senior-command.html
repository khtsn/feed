    <h1>Russia Jails General Who Criticized Army’s Senior Command</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The audio was made public by Andrei Gurulyov, a former general and a senior lawmaker in Russia’s governing party, underlining General Popov’s high reputation among the country’s traditional military elite and pro-war ultranationalist commentators. General Popov’s allies have presented him as an unassuming and effective battlefield commander who was more concerned with the welfare of his troops than the backdoor politics of military headquarters.</p><p>After the audio was made public, General Popov was arrested and charged with siphoning off metal matériel intended for the army. It was a type of crime that Mr. Prigozhin, General Popov’s former ally, had routinely accused General Gerasimov and his circle of in frequent expletive-laden audio and video messages.</p><p>On Thursday, a Russian military court stripped General Popov of his rank during a closed session and fined him more than $9,000, as well as sentenced him to five years in a low-security penal colony, <a href="https://ria.ru/20250424/khischenie-2013155818.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Russian state news media</a>.</p><p>The general’s lawyers said that they would appeal the sentence, the state news agencies added.</p><p>Some of General Popov’s influential supporters denounced the ruling, a rare outburst of dissent among Russia’s pro-war ultranationalist commentators, who have significantly toned down their messaging since Mr. Prigozhin’s mutiny and subsequent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/world/europe/prigozhin-plane-crash-russia-wagner.html" title="">death in a plane crash</a>.</p><p>“Russia will always remember Ivan Ivanovich Popov as a victor who deflected Ukrainian Armed Forces’s most powerful blow of this war,” Yuri Podoliaka, a military blogger, <a href="https://t.me/yurasumy/22584" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote to his three million followers</a> on the Telegram messaging app. He added: “This could not happen in a state with the rule of law.”</p></div></div>
