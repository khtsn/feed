Several people in the capital, Kyiv, said on Wednesday that they were pleased to have been given a respite after air-raid sirens and explosions shattered the pre-dawn calm on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>The eastern region of Donetsk, which has seen some of the fiercest fighting this year, was not spared. A Russian attack killed four members of a family in the tiny community of Izmailivka, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pgo.gov.ua/posts/pfbid02EEBM7h5VAUffd897ZXNVVKLdRkjB4MimpahQDhX6MgpumbazvaRABFGbWbwAPyUol" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state prosecutor’s office</a> said on Facebook. The settlement is a few miles west of Russian lines and in the path of Moscow’s assault on Pokrovsk, a small city that is a vital transport hub for Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk region.</p><p>“The people died buried under the rubble,” the statement said. The regional military administration said that two other people were killed in another attack on a Ukrainian-held settlement close to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/world/europe/bakhmut-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">city of Bakhmut</a>, which Russian forces captured more than a year ago after some of the most brutal combat since the full-scale invasion began.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Donetsk region is one of two that make up the Donbas, and Russian forces have been pummeling it with daily barrages of missiles, drones and artillery fire. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has made controlling the whole of the Donbas a major aim.</p><p>The Ukrainian authorities have for months pressed civilians to evacuate as Russian forces advanced. But many people have stayed for reasons of poverty, ill health or attachment to their homes and farms.</p><p>Russian forces seized the Donetsk cities of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/europe/ukraine-war-marinka-russia.html" title="">Marinka</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/world/europe/ukraine-avdiivka-withdraw-despair.html" title="">Avdiivka</a> early in the year and have since then been moving slowly west toward Pokrovsk, which had a population of around 61,000 before the full-scale invasion.</p><p>The advance has accelerated slightly in the last three weeks since Ukraine launched an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion-war.html" title="">incursion into the Kursk region</a> of southwestern Russia, a significant development in the war.</p><p>Military analysts say that there is little chance that the city of Pokrovsk could fall imminently given the pace of Russia’s advance and the distance to the front line. The regional military administration, however, announced a curfew for Pokrovsk starting on Wednesday from 3 p.m. to 11 a.m. No reason was given for the decision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Despite the peril in the east, the absence of a large-scale missile and drone attack overnight still came as a relief to some in Ukraine. Ukraine’s Air Force said on Wednesday that it had issued warnings about possible attacks, but that no missiles or exploding drones had been launched.</p><p>Julia Boiko, 46, a resident of Kyiv who works as a nanny, said the sounds of explosions earlier this week had terrified her 3-month-old kitten as they sheltered in the corridor of her apartment building.</p><p>“It was stressful for me and for him,” Ms. Boiko said.</p><p>Stanislav Kozliuk<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Deadly Russian Barrage:</strong> Russia launched a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-kursk.html">fresh wave of missile and drone attacks</a> on Kyiv and several other large Ukrainian cities, continuing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missiles-kyiv.html">far-reaching bombing campaign</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Poetry Boom:</strong> With verses that capture the raw emotions of the war and resonate deeply with the population, Ukrainian poets have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/world/europe/ukraine-poets-russia-war.html">emerged as some of the country’s most influential voices</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modi’s Kyiv Visit:</strong> Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India visited Kyiv, furthering a diplomatic effort by Ukraine to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/world/europe/ukraine-modi-india.html">engage non-Western nations</a> in potential settlement talks with Russia.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Shift on Putin in Russia:</strong> Negative feelings about President Vladimir Putin have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/us/politics/russia-putin-attitudes-social-media.html">appeared to increase across Russia</a> since Ukraine’s incursion into the country, according to a firm that tracks Russian attitudes.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
