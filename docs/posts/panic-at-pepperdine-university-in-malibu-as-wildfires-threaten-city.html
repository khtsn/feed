Embers had sparked tiny flare-ups on the school grounds, setting palm trees ablaze. Helicopters were descending to extract water from a campus pond.</p><p>And so the students gathered, many in their pajamas, in the library and in the campus center where the windows framed a distressing sight: Flames ravaging the mountains in the not so far distance; smoke spiraling in the dark sky.</p><p>They called their parents. They prayed.</p><p>So went early Tuesday morning for nearly 3,000 students, faculty members and staff members at Pepperdine University, a Christian school in Malibu known for its bucolic setting of rolling hills and ocean views.</p><p>Around them, the Franklin fire, fueled by fierce winds, ravaged the Santa Monica Mountains and forced thousands of people to evacuate from Malibu — the famed affluent coastal enclave that boasts picturesque beaches and celebrity homeowners. Schools were closed, and residents were ordered to stay away.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The blaze also shut down a portion of the Pacific Coast Highway, a key artery in and out of the city, as flames leaped across it and threatened the Malibu Pier, a popular tourist attraction. By Tuesday afternoon, the wildfire had burned more than 2,800 acres, and officials said that gusts as strong as 60 miles per hour had challenged the more than 700 firefighters responding to the scene.</p><p>“But rest assured, we are going to have a coordinated air and ground assault on this fire for as long as it takes,” said the Los Angeles County fire chief, Anthony C. Marrone.</p><p>Sheriff Robert Luna of Los Angeles County said that about 18,000 people were in the mandatory or voluntary evacuation zones. Malibu city officials <a href="https://www.malibucity.org/AlertCenter.aspx?AID=UPDATE-Evacuations-Tuna-Cyn-to-Trancas-P-3296" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that some homes had been damaged or destroyed, but they did not have details about the scale. No injuries or deaths had been reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man in a yellow firefighting suit and others behind him in orange suits gather near red fire trucks." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv/10nat-malibu-fire-phqv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/153b4c36-173f-583a-98fc-00a8ec04ae68" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prison crews preparing to help fight the wildfire.

But living on the coast has become more challenging in recent years. After heavy rains, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-11/pch-closed-in-malibu-due-to-landslide" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mudslides have repeatedly forced the closure of the Pacific Coast Highway</a>. Six years ago, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/us/photos-california-fire-damage.html" title="">Woolsey fire</a> destroyed <a href="https://malibucity.org/DocumentCenter/View/30937/CM_Update_10-28-22" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of homes and killed three people</a>.

He added that there had been no injuries and little to no damage to structures on campus. The last time the university had done something similar was during the Woolsey fire.</p><p>Though Pepperdine has nearly 9,000 undergraduate and graduate students, as well as hundreds of employees, most community members stayed off campus on Monday night. Across campus early Tuesday, some lugged suitcases, preparing to leave anyway, while others were confused, asking what was going on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We weren’t really too concerned at the beginning, but then the power went out, and people started freaking out,” said Michael Robinson, 20, a sophomore.</p><p>Charis Kai, a freshman, was nearly asleep when her resident adviser pounded on the door to her dorm room. She loaded her backpack with her laptop, chargers and wallet and headed to the library.</p><p>There, the smell of smoke had crept inside. Some students sang worship songs. Others cried.</p><p>Many could not help but gather around the windows to watch the spectacle of flames. Any unease was heightened by the crowd remarking on a blaze that appeared to only march forward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Known as a coastal refuge for the rich and famous, Malibu is also susceptible to both wildfires and sea-level rise.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“There was a lot of anxiety going on, because everyone was shouting things, like, ‘It’s coming closer, we’re going to die,’” Ms. Kai, 19, said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>She and her friends eventually decided to stop looking at the windows. “When you see the fire coming closer, that’s what makes everything worse,” she said.</p><p>The university canceled final exams for the week.</p><p>Those who decided to flee were left wondering how others had fared.</p><p>Jessica Hooten Wilson, a humanities professor, and her husband had managed to find shelter at a hotel an hour away. She and her husband had rounded up their four children, not even stopping to grab extra clothes before they hurried to their car. As they drove, the family could feel the heat emanating from the fire.</p><p>“I didn’t know if our friends were OK,” she said. “We were just driving away with the flames in the hills in the background.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Jesus Jiménez<!-- -->, <!-- -->Matt Stevens<!-- -->, <!-- -->Vik Jolly<!-- -->, <!-- -->Andrés R.
