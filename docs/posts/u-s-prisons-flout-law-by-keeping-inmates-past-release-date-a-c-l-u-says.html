Under the law, inmates can accrue credit toward accelerated release by enrolling in a range of education, behavioral, substance abuse treatment and vocational programs.</p><p>Questioned about the delays before a House committee hearing in July, Colette S. Peters, the bureau’s director, acknowledged the challenges.</p><p>“There’s a lot of frustration with the adults in custody,” she said, adding, “We simply don’t have the capacity in the community” to process all of the inmates granted early release under the law.</p><p>The bureau’s budget has flatlined in recent years. That has left an agency already grappling with chronic staffing shortages without the necessary funding to increase staffing to process early releases, monitor former inmates placed in home confinement or to hire private contractors to run halfway houses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The shortfall has been exacerbated by the long and complicated process of awarding contracts to private vendors who run transitional housing programs, bureau officials have said.</p><p>The A.C.L.U., in its lawsuit, acknowledged the challenges faced by the system, but accused the bureau of treating the law as optional, rather than compulsory.</p><p>To make that case, the plaintiffs cited the bureau’s decision to change the word “shall” in the law to “may” in the regulations to enact it.</p><p>“This difference is not academic — it affects real people, every day,” lawyers for the A.C.L.U. wrote in an 18-page lawsuit filed in the Federal District Court of Washington. “For thousands of individuals, the B.O.P.’s unlawful regulation has already translated into additional time in prison beyond what the law allows. And it continues to affect thousands of individuals every year.”</p><p>The First Step Act created a system of earned time credits for prisoners who participated in programs found to reduce recidivism. Inmates can shave off 10 days from their sentence for every 30 days spent in such programs. People convicted of homicide, threats to public officials, terrorism-related offenses and other serious offenses are not eligible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The lawsuit includes testimonials from prisoners, who seized on the opportunity presented by the law, only to face crushing disappointment.</p><p>Glen Galemmo, a 59-year old serving a 10-year prison term in South Carolina for wire fraud and money laundering, was initially told he was eligible to be released in July — but that date was pushed back to May 2025.</p><p>Mr. Galemmo, who has developed a serious kidney condition in recent years, said the delay had created a serious hardship for his family, which needs his help and income.</p><p>“My wife of 36 years is currently providing care for her father, who is in the late stages of pancreatic cancer,” he told the A.C.L.U. in a transcribed phone call from prison this month. “Simultaneously, she is supporting our daughter, who is escaping an abusive marriage and finalizing her divorce.”</p><p>In part, the A.C.L.U. filed lawsuit the Friday afternoon leading into Christmas — rather than after the new year — because it hoped to prod officials to release Ms. Crowe by her newly calculated release date of late December, lawyers said.</p><p>“My heart was constantly pounding with excitement at the thought of such times that were just around the corner,” she wrote about the possibility of spending the holidays at home with her family.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Dec. 20, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a 50-year-old woman serving a federal prison sentence on drug charges. She is Vanessa Crowe, not Veronica.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
