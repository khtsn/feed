Ukrainian drone attacks temporarily closed at least a dozen Russian airports, including one outside Moscow where foreign dignitaries later began arriving for the parade. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, wrote in a post on Telegram that air defense forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones before they reached the city.</p><p>Russia had offered the three-day truce to begin at midnight on Wednesday ahead of the parade, which foreign leaders including China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, were scheduled to attend.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine rejected Russia’s offer as too short to allow for meaningful negotiations to end the war, and said Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had proposed the truce only to put guests at the Russian parade at ease. Ukraine has said it will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/europe/ukraine-cease-fire-talks-london.html" title="">adhere to a cease-fire</a> if it is extended for 30 days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The missile and drone attack on Kyiv followed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/europe/ukraine-drone-attack-moscow-airport-russia.html" title="">Ukrainian exploding drone attack</a> on Moscow on Tuesday that had damaged a building in Moscow, forcing airports serving the Russian capital to close for several hours. In Kyiv on Wednesday, the city’s military administrator said air defense forces shot down one ballistic missile and that debris rained down in an outlying district, starting a fire and wounding one person there.</p><p>Later, the authorities reported damage from debris after air defense forces shot down exploding drones over the city. Air defense teams with machine guns had opened fire throughout the city center.</p><p>Ukrainian officials also reported damage and fires at an office building, a high-rise under construction and an apartment block in Kyiv and in the city’s suburbs. Two victims were found dead in an apartment building that had caught fire, according to firefighters. Among the wounded were three children with burns.</p><p>Elsewhere in the country, local authorities in Zaporizhzhia, in southern Ukraine, reported fires and other damage from a volley of drones hitting the city. In total, Russia launched four ballistic missiles and 142 drones at Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky said in a post on Facebook.</p><p>In Russia, the Vnukovo airport outside Moscow, which has a separate terminal serving top officials and dignitaries, halted flights on Tuesday and early Wednesday morning. Later on Wednesday, the president of Mongolia arrived at the airport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>With Ukrainian drones in the sky, three other airports serving Moscow — Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky — also briefly closed on Wednesday and reported that some flights had been delayed and canceled.</p><p>Separately on Wednesday, Russian authorities restricted mobile internet services in Moscow as a security precaution and taxi, car-sharing and food-delivery services warned customers of lengthy shutdowns.</p><p>Nataliya Vasilyeva<!-- --> contributed reporting from Istanbul.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew E.
