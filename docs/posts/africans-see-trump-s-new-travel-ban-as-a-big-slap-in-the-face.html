The others are Chad, the Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan. The ban goes into effect on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Edjang had hoped to one day study medicine in the United States, where, he said, training was much better than in Equatorial Guinea, a country that is rich in oil but mired in pervasive poverty and inequality.</p><p>Those hopes have now faded, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Mogadishu, Somalia, last year.

During Mr. Trump’s first ban, in 2017 — which was seen as targeting Muslim-majority countries — many students, professionals and refugees faced prolonged uncertainty as the legal challenges wended their way through court.</p><p>“This is a worrying decision for us Equatoguineans, because we know that when we travel, we always try to respect the rules,” said Juan Pedro, a 40-year-old teacher in Malabo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even Africans from countries not on Mr. Trump’s list were anxious about what the new ban might mean for them, fearing it could be extended to other nations on a moment’s notice.</p><p>“Regardless of whether I have been a law abiding resident in USA, regardless of my contribution to the USA in any capacity, I may be asked to leave or prevented from re-entry into the country,” Isaac Antwi, a scientist from Ghana who studied in the United States, wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7336279435341438976/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s announcement on Wednesday included partial bans on countries such as Sierra Leone, where many were shocked to learn they were no longer welcome to travel to the United States.</p><p>In the capital, Freetown, Joseph Bockarie, a metalworker with a sister in the United States, was trying to decide what to do. His sister had invited him to visit, and he has saved up money for the trip. He has a visa appointment next week, but now he is not sure he will show up. “I am afraid to be rejected,” he said. “I can’t imagine that trauma.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A supermarket chain in Benghazi, Libya, last year.

He worried that it would affect his chances of visiting the United States someday, and said his government should do whatever it could to ensure it was not put on the list of fully banned countries.</p><p>On Thursday, the African Union <a href="https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20250605/statement-african-union-commission-us-travel-ban" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called on</a> the Trump administration to adopt a “more consultative approach” with the countries on the list. The group said it was concerned about the state of relations between the United States and African nations, which have been “carefully nurtured over decades.”</p><p>Since Mr. Trump took office in January, those relations have been strained. He imposed steep tariffs, throwing the future of a critical trade <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/africa/us-africa-agoa-suspensions.html" title="">program</a> into doubt. The Agency for International Development, which saved millions of African lives over decades, has been dismantled. Mr. Trump lectured South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in the Oval Office last month, on what he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-south-africa-white-farmers-congo-fact-check.html" title="">falsely claimed</a> amounted to a genocide against white South Africans.</p><p>David Gilmour, the U.S. ambassador to Equatorial Guinea, wrote on social media that 70 percent of the Equatoguineans who travel to the United States to studyoverstay their visas.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Those Equatoguineans who have not respected U.S. immigration law are causing a problem that has restricted the travel of their fellow citizens,” he wrote. “If you know someone who is presently in the United States without a valid visa, tell them to return to Equatorial Guinea immediately.”</p><p>Margarita Mbang, a 24-year-old student at the University of Equatorial Guinea, acknowledged that some citizens from her country, when they arrive in the United States, “stay forever.”</p><p>Mr. Trump’s proclamation also criticized nations on the list for refusing to take back citizens who were flagged for deportation by the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A camp for Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ivor Prickett for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Neither the West African regional body known as ECOWAS nor the Central African one called ECCAS immediately issued statements about the travel ban. Chad’s president, Mahamat Idriss Déby, said that he had instructed his government to suspend visas for Americans in response to Mr. Trump’s decision.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Chad has neither planes to offer nor billions of dollars to give, but Chad does have its dignity and pride,” he said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1010106674603291&amp;id=100068119038808&amp;rdid=hoar9i4QBQ2cbQJD#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>Bright Simons, a policy analyst in <a href="https://imaniafrica.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghana</a>, said African officials needed to recognize the “hyper-transactional and low-consultation model” of the Trump administration and try to keep up. “The rules of the game in Washington have changed,” he said. “Too many African embassies are staffed with people who can’t respond at the pace required with the skill necessary.”</p><p>The foreign minister of Sierra Leone, Timothy Kabba, acknowledged that in the past his country had refused to accept citizens in the United States who had been added to deportation lists. But that has changed since he took office in 2023, he said.</p><p>“Since I took over, we have accepted all identified affected persons,” Mr. Kabba said.</p><p>Some Africans said the ban presented an opportunity for African governments not only to push back against the Trump administration, but also to do better for all Africans.</p><p>Mohamed Kamara, a deliveryman in Freetown, Sierra Leone, called on his government to make sure there were enough jobs in the country for people to make a living. If there were, he said, there would be “no need for someone to go to another man’s country.”</p><p>“If there are job opportunities, there is no need to travel to hustle,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Young men loading ice in preparation for fishing trip in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yagazie Emezi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Samuel Obiang Mbana contributed reporting from Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, <!-- -->Joseph Johnson<!-- --> from Freetown, Sierra Leone, and <!-- -->Abdi Latif Dahir<!-- --> from Nairobi, Kenya.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ruth Maclean is the West Africa bureau chief for The Times, covering 25 countries including Nigeria, Congo, the countries in the Sahel region as well as Central Africa.</p></div><div><p>Saikou Jammeh is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Dakar, Senegal.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
