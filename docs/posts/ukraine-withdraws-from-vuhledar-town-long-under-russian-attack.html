It was not clear on Wednesday how many people remained, nor if all the Ukrainian soldiers who had been defending the town had managed to escape.</p><p>The Ukrainian eastern military command said it was issuing the formal order to retreat because of “a threat of encirclement.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The loss of Vuhledar will complicate the defense of the southwestern part of the Donetsk region, allowing the Russians to step up attacks in the direction of Pokrovsk, a rail and road hub, soldiers and military analysts said. Pokrovsk is also a gateway to the economically important Dnipro region.</p><p>Taking Vuhledar is also likely to ease pressure on Russia’s supply lines across southern Ukraine to Crimea, by pushing Ukrainian forces further from critical Russian rail and road links in occupied territory.</p><p>Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled Ukrainian government of Mariupol, a port city in eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia, said on Wednesday that holding the town would allow the Russians to restore their logistics in southern Ukraine. This would include “the systematic operation of the railroad” running from Russia to Mariupol’s port, he said.</p><p>The capture of Vuhledar also opens up some areas in the region that will be difficult to defend against Russian attack, Ukrainian soldiers said.</p><p>The villages to the town’s north and west are generally dotted with small homes and there are few significant geographic barriers like rivers or ravines for miles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Vuhledar sits at the nexus of the southern and eastern fronts and the Ukrainian military warned on Wednesday that there were already indications Russia was preparing to exploit its gains.</p><p>Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman for the Southern military command, told Radio Liberty on Wednesday that Russia was concentrating forces to assault the villages west of Vuhledar in an attempt to undermine Ukrainian supply lines.</p><p>“Today, the enemy is trying to concentrate forces and means to conduct assault operations,” he said. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia. He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.
