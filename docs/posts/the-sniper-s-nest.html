    <h1>The Sniper’s Nest</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Four years ago, this was a prime riverside location in the capital of a nation that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/world/africa/sudan-protests-khartoum.html" title="">seemed to be inching toward democracy</a>. Then came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/world/africa/sudan-military-coup.html" title="">a military coup</a>, and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/sudan-khartoum-military.html" title="">almost two years of civil war</a>, as the army and the Rapid Support Forces, its powerful paramilitary partner, turned on one another.</p><p>By March 12, when this photograph was taken, the river was more or less the front line.</p><p>This apartment block sits on the northern bank; the presidential palace, an emblem of power for centuries, is on the southern bank.</p><p>The R.S.F. took most of Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, in April 2023. The army held on to only a few bases across the city.</p><p>In recent months, as part of a vast counteroffensive, the army and militias allied with it have gradually reclaimed much of the north and east of the city.</p><p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/africa/sudan-civil-war-khartoum-battle.html" title="">the military celebrated reclaiming the palace</a>. Next, it hopes to drive the R.S.F. out of Khartoum entirely.</p><p>But even if the army succeeds, analysts see little chance of the war ending soon, and the fighting has already reduced much of the city to a charred wasteland.</p></div></div>
