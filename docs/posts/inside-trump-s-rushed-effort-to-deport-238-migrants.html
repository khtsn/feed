Later that night, he texted her through a government messaging app for detainees.</p><p>“I love you,” he wrote, “soon we will be together forever.”</p><p>Her husband, Arturo Suárez Trejo, 33, a musician, had been in American custody for a month, calling every few days to assure his family that he was OK, his relatives said. Now, the couple believed they would reunite and he would finally meet his daughter, Nahiara, who had been born during his brief stint as a migrant in the United States.</p><p>But less than a day later, Mr. Suárez was shackled, loaded onto a plane and sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, according to an internal government list of detainees obtained by The New York Times. Around the time Mr. Suárez was texting his wife, the Trump administration was quietly invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a sweeping wartime power that allows the government to swiftly deport citizens of an invading nation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Suárez and 237 others, the Trump administration argued after the order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became public</a>, were all members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, which was “aligned with” the Venezuelan government and was “perpetrating” an invasion of the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman holds a picture of her husband, who is shown squatting." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf/00int-venezuela-elsalvador-detainees-pltf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/2bcd3a55-cc54-55bb-8301-e12336786bf8" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Sánchez with a photo of her husband, Mr. Suárez.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cristobal Olivares for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Sánchez showing the last messages Mr. Suárez sent before she lost contact with him. “I love you with my life,” he wrote.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cristobal Olivares for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was an extraordinary move: The act has only been invoked three times in American history, experts say — most recently in World War II, when it was used to detain German, Italian and Japanese people.</p><p>And in this case, the Venezuelan men were declared “alien enemies” and shipped to a prison with little or no opportunity to contest the allegations against them, according to migrants, their lawyers, court testimony, judges and interviews with dozens of prisoners’ families conducted by The New York Times.</p><p>The government’s public declaration of the act was made on March 15 at 3:53 p.m., according to court records. The migrants were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/timeline-trump-deportation-flights-el-salvador.html" title="">all on flights to El Salvador</a> by 7:36 p.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Yet most of the men do not have criminal records in the United States or elsewhere in the region, beyond immigration offenses, a New York Times investigation has found. And very few of them appear to have any clear, documented links to the Venezuelan gang.</p><p>As they were being expelled, the detainees repeatedly begged officials to explain why they were being deported, and where they were being taken, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.67.7.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of their lawyers told the courts</a>. At no point, the lawyer said, did officers indicate that the men were being sent to El Salvador or that they were removed under the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>The Alien Enemies Act gives the U.S. government broad powers to detain people during times of war, but Supreme Court rulings make clear that detainees have a right to challenge the government, and are entitled to a hearing, before their removal.</p><p>Last month, an appeals court judge criticized the lack of due process under the Trump administration. “Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act,” said Judge Patricia Millett.</p><p>Then, last week, all nine Supreme Court justices said that targeted individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-venezuelan-deportations.html" title="">must be given time to contest their removal</a> before they’re expelled — and demanded that the Trump administration provide that opportunity going forward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In court, the administration has argued that the men can still challenge their incarceration — but that will be difficult, if not impossible, because they are already in El Salvador, out of reach of the American justice system, with little access to lawyers or even their family members.</p><p>“They should stay there for the rest of their lives,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/medialibrary/assets/video/59155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a>.</p><p>Then on Monday, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador forcefully backed the administration during a visit to the White House.

Their expulsion, the administration argues, is part of its plan to deport the worst migrant offenders.</p><p>Officials say they used criminal records, social media, surveillance data, interviews with migrants and other information, like tattoos, to make their accusations.</p><p>But a Times investigation found little evidence of any criminal background — or any association with the gang — for most of the men. In fact, the prosecutors, law enforcement officials, court documents and media reports that The Times uncovered or spoke to in multiple countries suggested that only a few of the detainees might have had any connection to Tren de Aragua.</p><p>Seeking to provide a fuller picture of who was imprisoned, a team of Times reporters and researchers ran the 238 names through three U.S. public records databases, checked backgrounds in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Chile, scoured court documents and news articles, spoke to dozens of family members and interviewed experts on Tren de Aragua.</p><p>The findings are not comprehensive — there is no global public database to search for every accusation, and the U.S. government did not share its evidence against the detainees. But The Times’s investigation provides a snapshot of who the United States sent to El Salvador.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Some of the prisoners do appear to have committed grave crimes. At least 32 of the men sent to El Salvador have faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad, including a man accused of participating in an assault in Chicago, another convicted of trying to smuggle arms out of the United States and others accused of theft, strangulation, domestic battery or harboring undocumented immigrants.</p><p>One has a homicide conviction in Venezuela, according to court documents. Another man was accused in Chile of kidnapping, drugging and raping a woman during a four-day rage.</p><p>Chilean prosecutors also believe the man is a member of Tren de Aragua, according to court documents. Investigators say they found his name and messages in the phones of other gang members.</p><p>Beyond that, The Times found that another two dozen of the men locked up in El Salvador had been accused or found guilty of lower-level offenses in the United States or elsewhere, including trespassing, speeding in a school zone and driving an improperly registered vehicle.</p><p>But for the others, including Mr. Suárez, the musician, The Times found no evidence of a criminal background, beyond offenses related to being unauthorized migrants. Mr. Suárez’s family presented official certificates from Venezuela, Colombia and Chile — where he lived in the past — saying he had no convictions in those nations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>All 238 men will spend at least a year in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a sprawling complex of concrete and barbed wire built by President Nayib Bukele, who has called himself “a dictator” and promoted the prison as a holding pen for his country’s worst criminals.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Salvador Melendez/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guards outside the prison where the migrants are being held.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Alex Brandon</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The United States is paying the government of El Salvador to incarcerate the Venezuelan prisoners.
