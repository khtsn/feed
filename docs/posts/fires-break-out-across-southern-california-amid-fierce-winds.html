    <h1>Fires Break Out Across Southern California Amid Fierce Winds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With parched vegetation and one of the strongest Santa Ana wind events in over a decade expected to sweep through this week, Southern California is bracing for the type of weather that can help wildfires spark and spread quickly.</p><p>Forecasters on Tuesday warned that they expected “life-threatening and destructive” winds to combine with dry air, creating a critical fire-weather event in Southern California in the coming days. “This is about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,” forecasters said.</p><div><p>A rare “particularly dangerous situation” red flag warning was issued for portions of Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, including downtown Los Angeles, for Tuesday and Wednesday. It is the third time this season that forecasters have issued this level of warning; the previous two warnings came during conditions that led to the Mountain and Franklin wildfires. Still, such warnings are rare: Before this year, the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles office had issued them only twice, both for warnings in 2020.</p><p>In addition to the fire risk, widespread damaging wind gusts, reaching 50 to 80 miles per hour, and even above 100 m.p.h. in the mountains, may knock down trees and power lines. Forecasters warned that this would most likely be the most destructive windstorm since 2011, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/us/santa-ana-winds-buffet-california.html" title="">powerful winds blew through Pasadena</a> and the nearby foothills of the San Gabriel Valley, closing schools and causing extensive damage. This week’s storm could cause comparable damage in similar areas, along the Highway 118 and 210 corridors, forecasters said.</p><p>In anticipation, utility companies that serve the region warned they could begin shutting off power to some customers, though none had done so yet as of late Monday. San Diego Gas and Electric Company said it was considering power shut-offs for more than 64,000 customers as early as noon on Tuesday. Southern California Edison said it was considering cutting off nearly 400,000 customers, one of its largest pre-emptive outages ever.</p><p>These winds aren’t unusual, and the strongest Santa Ana winds typically happen this time of the year. But by January, Los Angeles has usually had enough rain that the fire threat is mitigated because the vegetation is greener and there is more moisture in the ground. This year, that hasn’t been the case, said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Los Angeles.</p><p>Because the vegetation is extremely dry, if a fire starts, these winds will help it spread rapidly — just as they did with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/mountain-fire-ventura-california.html" title="">Mountain fire</a> in November across Ventura County and with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/franklin-fire-malibu-california.html" title="">Franklin fire</a> in Malibu in December. “Any spark, any ignition source, could lead to something very, very dramatic, very, very quickly,” Mr. Thompson said.</p><div><div><blockquote data-cards=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HEADS UP!!! A LIFE-THREATENING, DESTRUCTIVE, Widespread Windstorm is expected Tue afternoon-Weds morning across much of Ventura/LA Co. Areas not typically windy will be impacted. See graphic for areas of greatest concern. Stay indoors, away from windows, expect poweroutages. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LA</a> <a href="https://t.co/yl83LxeMEc">pic.twitter.com/yl83LxeMEc</a></p>— NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/1876343016526598292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2025</a></blockquote>

</div></div><p>After a short-lived dip in speed on Tuesday afternoon, the winds are expected to accelerate to dangerous levels from Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. Gusty winds and dangerous conditions could linger into Thursday or even Friday.</p><p>The longer-lasting strong winds will occur mostly across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Moderate to strong winds may even reach the Los Angeles County coast, especially in the Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills, Sepulveda Pass, Malibu, and extending into Palos Verdes and Catalina Island from Tuesday evening into Wednesday, according to forecasters in the Weather Service’s Los Angeles office.</p><p>Even areas that don’t often see damaging wind gusts, such as portions of the Los Angeles basin and the San Gabriel Valley, could see strong winds during this event’s peak. Fire danger will also increase deeper into Southern California, with critical fire risks in inland Orange County, the Santa Ana Mountains, Inland Empire and San Bernardino Mountains.</p><p>The winds may return next week. “We’re not catching a break,” Mr. Thompson said. “There’s just no rain in the forecast. So this is going to be a persistent issue for the next couple of weeks.”</p><p>Jesus Jiménez<!-- --> contributed reporting from Los Angeles.</p></div></div>
