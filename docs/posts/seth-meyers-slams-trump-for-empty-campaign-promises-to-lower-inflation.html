Immediately after a campaign in which he repeatedly said he would bring down prices quickly and that it would be easy, he told Time magazine, ‘It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.’ Trump will be a terrible president — he’d be an even worse airline pilot.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-4c3014be">The Punchiest Punchlines (Not for Sale Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“There are so many reasons this is insane — one being it’s crazy.

Look, I’m no war expert — I’ll leave decisions regarding our military to alcoholic Fox News hosts — but I’m almost certain invading Greenland is insane.” <em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p><p>“At the very least, it would have been nice to hear about this during the campaign. You had time to tell a 10-minute story about Arnold Palmer’s shower penis, but not one story about bombing Greenland? That would have been good to know.” <em>— DESI LYDIC</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Jamie Lee Curtis got teary talking about the Pacific Palisades fires on Wednesday’s “Tonight Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-1a7073d0">What We’re Excited About on Thursday Night</h2><p>Pamela Anderson will discuss her new film, “The Last Showgirl,” on Thursday’s “Late Night.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Roles like Nicole Kidman’s in “Babygirl” are gaining steam on the big screen.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Niko Tavernise/A24, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/arts/older-woman-babygirl-kidman.html" title="">The older woman</a>” is having a hot moment on movie screens.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
