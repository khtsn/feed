But since President Trump took power in January, the United States has done an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/trump-diplomacy.html" title="">about-face</a> on its foreign policy, making good relations with Russia a priority over those with Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/04/multimedia/04ukraine-react-vljt/04ukraine-react-vljt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/04/multimedia/04ukraine-react-vljt/04ukraine-react-vljt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/04/multimedia/04ukraine-react-vljt/04ukraine-react-vljt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="President Trump and President Zelensky seated in the Oval Office and gesturing at each other.

U.S. officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">held initial peace talks</a> with senior Russian officials in Saudi Arabia — without inviting Ukraine. And then on Friday, a meeting between Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance turned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/zelensky-showdown-trump.html" title="">spectacularly hostile</a>. The leaders failed to sign a deal on critical minerals as they had been expected to do.</p><p>Since then, all Ukraine seems to have been holding its breath. Many people had been hoping for the resurrection of the minerals deal, so that the United States would continue to support Ukraine in return for a share of profits from its resources.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But on Tuesday morning, those hopes were dashed — at least for now — when news spread that the United States was temporarily suspending <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html" title="">military aid</a>.</p><p>Aliona Khrul, 24, a lawyer, didn’t see the news before going to the Trump Pizza Station to get a coffee and a tuna sandwich. When she heard about the U.S. decision, she started crying.</p><p>“I feel like we are being abandoned, just abandoned by everyone,” said Ms. Khrul, who like everyone else here, said she had lost people in the war, including a classmate and a close friend. Last week, she attended the funeral of a good friend of her boyfriend who was killed fighting at the front.</p><p>She added: “And in the end, what was the point of all the fighting, of all the people who died? I don’t know what to do.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Across the country, from the occupied territories in the east to cities in western Ukraine, people said they were shocked and upset about what the U.S. decision might mean. Some said Ukraine would have to make the best of a bad peace; others said Ukraine would keep fighting, hopefully with European support.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many people in Ukraine are expressing shock at the U.S. decision to suspend military aid.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Artem Kholodevych, 33, a lieutenant colonel in the military who lost his right leg at the front, said he believed that Ukraine had enough stockpiles of weapons to hold out until European allies could increase aid deliveries.</p><p>“If U.S. aid does not resume throughout Trump’s entire presidency, it will be an unpleasant and challenging period for us,” he said. “But in that case, European security will face an even greater threat, which is why I am confident that our allies in Europe will respond accordingly and significantly increase their support for Ukraine.”</p><p>In Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, one woman, who spoke anonymously by phone because she was worried about retaliation from Russia, said she felt Mr. Trump was trying to get Ukraine to accept a bad deal by temporarily suspending aid.</p><p>“Ukraine now has very little room to maneuver,” she said.</p><p>Members of Mr. Trump’s team were not politicians, but political entrepreneurs, she said. “They perceive Ukraine as a weak competitor in this marketplace, one that must accept the conditions set by the market leader and submit.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>She added: “Unfortunately, humanitarianism is absent from U.S. politics. They do not care about Ukraine’s casualties, its tragedies, or the war crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine.”</p><p>Many Ukrainians had hoped that Mr. Trump would bring peace.</p><p>In the months after the U.S. election in November, they said that Mr. Trump’s unpredictable style might actually help Ukraine. Some Ukrainians spoke positively about Mr. Trump’s business acumen and had hoped that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — rather than Mr. Zelensky — might rub Mr. Trump the wrong way.</p><p>After Mr. Trump’s 2016 election, one Ukrainian businessman even created two cafes named after Mr. Trump, including what is now the pizza place.</p><p>The Trump Pizza Station used to be the Trump White Coffee Bar but decided to add pizza to the menu in January. The pizzas have English names, and the restaurant’s soundtrack features a lot of ZZ Top, including the song “Breakaway,” a song about a potential breakup.</p><p>One pizza, the Trumpino, has red sauce, prosciutto, artichoke hearts, mushrooms and Grana Padano cheese. On some of the signage, the letter “u” in Trump has been made to look like a half-filled coffee cup.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Trump Pizza Station used to be the Trump White Coffee Bar but decided to add pizza to the menu in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Volodymyr Pynzenyk, 31, a risk management consultant, was eating at the cafe on Tuesday afternoon and pointed out that Ukraine had started producing its own weapons. </p><p>“Nothing much changes for us. We have always had to be in the position that we are independent, for ourselves,” he said. He added: “Perhaps the situation is not as critical as it seems.”</p><p>Many people here complained about the cafe’s name. Here was one thing they could change, something tangible, when everything else felt so out of control.</p><p>“I don’t think this place will survive with that name here,” said Dasha Holomoz, 21, a college student who complained there were no other cafes nearby.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Over the past month, people started asking the cafe’s employees about the name, sometimes aggressively, according to the manager, Serhii, 37, who didn’t want his last name used so that he would not be targeted by online critics in Russia. </p><p>Serhii, who wore a T-shirt with the colors of the Ukrainian flag and the word “Unbreakable” on the front, said he was against changing the name — they had been building the Trump coffee brand for the past five years, after all. But the owner has caved.</p><p>Soon, he said, the Trump Pizza Bar will be known as the Frank Pizza Station — “frank” as in honest and forthright. By Tuesday night, the cafe had already changed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frank.kyiv?igsh=YjhybHFlNjd5Zzhs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its social media profile</a> to feature the new name.</p><p>Oleksandra Mykolyshyn<!-- -->, <!-- -->Liubov Sholudko<!-- --> and <!-- -->Evelina Riabenko<!-- --> contributed reporting from Kyiv, and <!-- -->Yurii Shyvala<!-- --> from Lviv, Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Over the past month, people started asking the cafe’s employees about the restaurant’s name, and sometimes aggressively, according to the manager.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kim Barker is a Times reporter writing in-depth stories about the war in Ukraine.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kim-barker">More about Kim Barker</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>At Trump-Themed Cafe, Hope Is in Short Supply<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Military Aid Paused:</strong> President Trump temporarily suspended the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html">delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine</a>, senior administration and military officials said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/trump-ukraine-aid.html">Here’s what to know</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Frozen Russian Assets: </strong>Trump’s threat to abandon Ukraine added urgency to plans to fund security or reconstruction with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/business/russia-assets-ukraine-trump.html">roughly $300 billion owned by Russia’s central bank</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. Role in the World: </strong>The Serb region has for decades felt out of step with — and victimized by — what it views as a hostile, American-dominated world order. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/europe/russia-trump-bosnia.html">Now many feel that things have changed with the return of Trump</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Courage With Clay: </strong>Intensified by the war with Russia and the unpredictability of the future, GORN Ceramics’s output is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/arts/ukraine-statues-design.html">testament to creative freedom and resilience</a> in the face of unimaginable hardship.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukrainians Blindsided: </strong>Ukrainians in the area around Kropyvnytskyi — a city with major deposits of critical minerals —  were largely excited about the idea of a proposed deal that would give Americans some profits from mining in the area.
