    <h1>Oil Prices Slide Further on Plans to Increase Supply</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The eight countries that make up the OPEC Plus cartel said on Saturday that they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/opec-plus-oil-production-trump.html" title="">further ramp up production in June</a>.</p><p>Lower commodity prices are causing some companies to pull back. There are about 9 percent fewer rigs drilling wells in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oil field, than there were this time last year, when oil was trading near $80 a barrel, according to Baker Hughes.</p><p>On Friday, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest U.S. oil and gas companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/energy-environment/exxon-chevron-earnings.html" title="">reported their lowest first-quarter earnings in years</a>. Those financial results reflect the market before Mr. Trump further escalated tariffs on China in early April.</p><p>“It is clear that this uncertainty is weighing on economic forecasts, causing significant volatility and raising the prospects of slower growth,” Darren Woods, Exxon’s chief executive, told analysts.</p></div></div>
