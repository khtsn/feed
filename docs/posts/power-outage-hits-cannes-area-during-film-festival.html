It said the outage was tied to two problems on separate power lines. The first was a fire at a substation near Cannes that started shortly before 3 a.m. Firefighters brought the blaze under control, and electricity was restored by diverting power from other lines.</p><p>But around 10 a.m., the company also detected an unstable pylon on a separate line east of the city that was threatening to topple, forcing crews to cut power in the area once more.</p><p>While the company said it was too early to tell what had caused those problems, some local authorities voiced concern that they were the result of intentional sabotage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Éric Ciotti, a right-wing lawmaker representing the area, <a href="https://x.com/eciotti/status/1926238992657170863" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a picture on X of a leaning pylon</a> and said it had been sabotaged. Referring to the pylon and the fire, he added that “initial elements” suggested a “deliberate” act, although he did not say what that assessment was based on.</p><p>“We need transparency and fast answers,” Mr. Ciotti said.</p><p>The concerns that the outage was the result of sabotage recalled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/world/europe/rail-sabotage-france-olympics.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">the arson attacks that caused brief travel chaos</a> in France on the opening day of the Summer Olympics in Paris last year. French authorities did not determine who was responsible for that arson but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/world/europe/france-olympics-sabotage-anarchists.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">cast suspicion on “ultraleft” anticapitalist groups</a> that want to disrupt the workings of the state.</p><p>Organizers of the film festival in Cannes said in a statement that it had quickly switched over to an independent power supply, “allowing all scheduled events and screenings, including the closing ceremony, to proceed as planned and under normal conditions.” It said screenings at one theater had been “temporarily suspended.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The actress Margaret Qualley at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday.

A backup generator kicked in 20 minutes later and the screening resumed.</p><p>The power outage also disrupted daily life in Cannes, which becomes a tourist magnet when movie stars and directors are in town.</p><p>On the clock tower atop the city’s old quarter, the hands froze at just past 10 o’clock. Some boutiques were closed on the Croisette, a promenade along the beach known for its high-end hotels and luxury shops. Dark traffic lights forced police officers to direct the flow of cars through busy intersections.</p><p>When the power came back on at one restaurant just before 3 p.m., patrons clapped and cheered.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aurelien Breeden is a reporter for The Times in Paris, covering news from France.</p></div><div><p>Kyle Buchanan is a pop culture reporter and also serves as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-projectionist">The Projectionist</a>, the awards season columnist for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
