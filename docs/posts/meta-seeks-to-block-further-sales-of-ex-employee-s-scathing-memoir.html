Meta pursued arbitration, arguing that the book is prohibited under a nondisparagement contract she signed as a global affairs employee.</p><p>During an emergency hearing on Wednesday, the arbitrator, Nicholas Gowen, found that Meta had provided enough grounds that Ms. Wynn-Williams had potentially violated her contract, according to a legal filing posted by Meta. The two parties will now begin private arbitration.</p><p>In addition to halting book promotions and sales, Ms. Wynn-Williams must refrain from engaging in or “amplifying any further disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments,” according to the filing. She also must retract all previous disparaging comments “to the extent within her control.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The filing did not appear to limit the publisher, Flatiron Books, or its parent company, Macmillan, from continuing publication of the memoir.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism” was released last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Flatiron, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Meta has vehemently denied the allegations in the book.</p><p>The book is a “mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,” a Meta spokesman, Andy Stone, said in a statement. Ms. Wynn-Williams was fired for cause, he added, and an investigation at the time determined that “she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Flatiron Books did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Ms. Wynn-Williams, who worked at what was then called Facebook from 2011 to 2018, did not comment.</p><p>The move to publish the arbitration filing is one of Meta’s most forceful public repudiations of a former employee’s tell-all memoir, several of which have been published over the past two decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Meta executives have also responded online to Ms. Wynn-Williams’s claims, calling most of them wildly exaggerated or flat-out false.</p><p>It is unclear whether Meta’s attempts to claw back Ms. Wynn-Williams’s book will ultimately be successful. In 2023, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that it is generally illegal for companies to offer severance agreements that prohibit workers from making potentially disparaging statements about former employers, including discussing sexual harassment or sexual assault accusations.</p><p>In a Meta shareholder report in 2022, the company’s board of directors said that it did not require employees “to remain silent about harassment or discrimination,” and that the company “strictly prohibits retaliation against any personnel” for speaking up on these issues.</p><p>And in 2018, Meta said it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/technology/facebook-arbitration-harassment.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">no longer force employees to settle sexual harassment claims</a> in private arbitration, following a similar stance taken by Google at the time.</p><p>Sheera Frenkel<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco.
