    <h1>Reading Aloud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard Sentences</a> are hundreds of sentences that have been used for many decades to test technologies in which understanding speech is essential, like telephone systems and hearing aids. I came across the list recently and was charmed by it.</p><p>Some sample sentences: It’s easy to tell the depth of a well. The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage. Help the woman get back to her feet. The harder he tried the less he got done. It caught its hind paw in a rusty trap. Write a fond note to the friend you cherish. Most of the news is easy for us to hear.</p><p>These sentences weren’t chosen for their meaning but for their “phonetic balance,” the way<span>  </span>their frequency of sounds are similar to spoken language. They’re tools, not advice or koans. But reading them I felt moved as when reading a poem. I found a site where you can <a href="https://www.voiptroubleshooter.com/open_speech/american.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listen to people read the sentences</a> in different accents and tried to see if it was possible to hear a series of lines aloud without them gathering meaning. These narrators were particularly skilled at reading without affect, but it’s impossible to listen to even the least emotive person recite: “The stray cat gave birth to kittens. The young girl gave no clear response. The meal was cooked before the bell rang. What joy there is in living,” and not detect some poetry.</p><p>Is there a person on earth who doesn’t love to be read to? Children get storytime, nightly if they’re lucky, but once we know how to read we typically do it by ourselves. Last year I wrote about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/briefing/falling-asleep-to-audiobooks.html" title="">audiobooks as bedtime stories for adults</a>, how they can tap into that desire that’s maybe dormant in all of us, the desire to have our sleep treated as a project worthy of coaxing and custodianship. Every few months I let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ulxxVL6HZg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joseph Brodsky reading his poem “A Song”</a> lull me to sleep. Recently a friend and I read each other portions of Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself.” Reading to someone is different from simply speaking to them. The words aren’t yours, so you don’t own the thoughts or meaning, only the communication. You’re free to interpret, to perform. It’s a process of co-discovery, intimate but, unlike conversation, the content comes from a third party. It’s about connecting and it’s also about consuming art together, whether that art is a poem or “The Polar Express” or a novel from which you and your sweetheart read alternating chapters to each other while cooking dinner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There are so many ways to be read to now, if that’s your thing. Audiobooks, articles narrated by people and by artificial intelligence, recordings of author appearances at bookstores, and yes, WAV files of curiously blasé people muttering Harvard Sentences into the void. There is little I like more than reading by myself, or listening to a book alone on a long car drive. But you might still make the effort to read and be read to by the people in your life. It’s cozy. It’s strange and exciting if you’ve grown accustomed to reading as a solo activity. You’re living in your head all the time with your own voice as the narrator. It’s so lovely to listen to someone else tell the stories for a change.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>“The language becomes a part of the body, which is why there is always a curious tenderness, almost an erotic quality, in those 18th- and 19th-century literary scenes where a book is being read aloud in mixed company.” Verlyn Klinkenborg, from 2009, on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/16/opinion/16sat4.html" title="">the pleasures of reading aloud</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/behind-bars-finding-meaning-in-a-book-read-aloud/" title="">“Reading Aloud to My Daughter, From Prison.”</a></p></li><li><p>From Gizmodo: “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-harvard-sentences-secretly-shaped-the-development-1689793568" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The ‘Harvard Sentences’ Secretly Shaped the Development of Audio Tech</a>.”</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Film</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pamela Anderson in “The Last Showgirl.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zoey Grossman/Roadside Attractions</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><ul><li><p>In “The Last Showgirl,” Pamela Anderson stars as a dancer at a Las Vegas revue.
