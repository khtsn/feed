    <h1>Out of Season</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>You are going to encounter people this weekend who will tell you that there’s one week left of summer. You don’t have to believe them. You don’t have to be one of them.</p><p>You can join me and the other equinoctials (do you think this term could catch on?) who live by the almanac. We’re not going gentle into our woolly cardigans until Sept. 22, the actual first day of fall. We’re savoring every last tomato, still sentimental about late sunsets, weirdly fond of that residual itch in a fading mosquito bite.</p><p>Every time summer turns to fall, I do this. I try to articulate to anyone who will indulge me why one time of year is better than another, to make a case for why light and warm is superior to dark and cold. It’s a losing game: I’m burning whatever daylight is left arguing for why the earth should revolve differently, powerless against nature. I feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF5xBtaL3YI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Werner Herzog in “Burden of Dreams,”</a> railing at the jungle: “Even the stars up here in the sky look like a mess. There is no harmony in the universe.”</p><p>There is no harmony in the universe, so we try to create some with the calendar. Labor Day arrives and we shift gears, shift wardrobes and menus and mind-sets. Maybe our gaits get faster. Summer self is self-indulgent; fall self is all determination. Summer self puts things off and fall self gets things done. There’s a harmony and a rhythm to our seasonal incarnations that keeps things interesting, divides existence intomovements: adagio, andante, allegro.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“Transitions are hard,” a colleague said to me today. She was joking around, being melodramatic about how she’d just arrived at the office and needed a minute to collect herself before a meeting began. But the transition from summer to fall, as anyone who’s ever tried to get a child ready for the first day of school can tell you, can be a particularly challenging one. And it doesn’t necessarily get better when you’re decades removed from going to school yourself. Summer’s all potential, all expectation. The end of summer is, inevitably, some of that potential unrealized, some of those expectations unmet. A little mourning might be appropriate.</p><p>But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Whether you believe that summer’s finito in a week or that we’ve still got time, there’s this weekend to exploit. This weekend, late August, 2024, wherever you find yourself, however you find yourself. Will you be stocking up on school supplies? Dropping someone off at college? Will you spend the weekend hunting down the perfect peach? Maybe you’re working, or worrying, or lying in a hammock watching the clouds. What do you want to do? How do you want things to go? This weekend, like every weekend, you’ve got choices.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>How to cope with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/well/mind/fall-autumn-anxiety.html" title="">fall anxiety.</a></p></li><li><p>“In August, I feel acutely how lucky I am to belong to a species for whom yearning has no season.” Margaret Renkl on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/opinion/summer-desire-age.html" title="">the end of summer</a>.</p></li><li><p>It’s not too late to attend to your <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/style/summer-bucket-list.html" title="">summer bucket list</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-1439ed98"><span><strong>THE WEEK IN CULTURE</strong></span></h3><p>Film and TV</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Phil Donahue in 1973.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Phil Donahue, who died this week at 88, will be remembered as the king of daytime television. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/arts/television/phil-donahue-show-episodes.html" title="">Here are three episodes</a> that help explain his dominance.</p></li><li><p>“Blink Twice,” directed by Zoë Kravitz and starring her fiancé, Channing Tatum, is one of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/movies/new-movies-this-week-critics.html" title="">10 movies our critics reviewed this week</a>.</p></li><li><p>“Rings of Power,” the “Lord of the Rings” prequel series, returns on Amazon Prime next week.

Her song “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2qSkIjg1o9h3YT9RAgYN75?si=038a78d6a9d44dbd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Espresso</a>” was near ubiquitous, so much so that it started <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/357907/spotify-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-chappell-roan-algorithm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a conspiracy theory</a> about why Spotify seemed to be recommending it to everyone, no matter their taste. Carpenter also supported Taylor Swift on tour, and social media buzzed about her relationship with the “Saltburn” star Barry Keoghan.</p><p>Given her sudden ubiquity, it might be surprising learn that this is Carpenter’s sixth album. Her star has been a slow burner. She was, as Shaad D’Souza wrote in The Times, formerly a member of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/arts/music/sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-espresso-good-luck-babe.html" title="">pop’s middle class</a>”: internet favorites whose celebrity outmatched their commercial success. This album — and her tour, which begins next month — will likely solidify her pop ascendancy.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Simpson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-6cbb8448">Sweet Corn Pudding</h2><p>It’s been an excellent corn season here in the Northeast, with the ears in green-husked profusion at farmers’ markets everywhere. I like to spend the first few weeks of corn season devouring them simply, just boiled, buttered and salted. But a month in, it’s time to branch out and add juicy kernels to salads, sautés, sheet-pan meals and even dessert. Eric Kim’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022482-sweet-corn-pudding?algo=identity&amp;fellback=true&amp;imp_id=7623545107925603&amp;req_id=8253594679471384&amp;surface=cooking-search-web&amp;variant=holdout_best_cooking-search" title="">sweet corn pudding</a> is a mild, creamy custard based on majarete, a popular treat in parts of Latin America. It’s made by simmering corn cobs in milk, then using the infused liquid as the base of a cornstarch-thickened pudding scented with vanilla. As an added bonus, the cook gets to nibble on the milk-poached corn on the cob, a delicious byproduct that gives you something to snack on while waiting for the custard to chill.</p><h3 id="link-20a8f964"><span><strong>REAL ESTATE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alane Kruk</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>The Hunt: </strong>A retired schoolteacher sought a new start in Southern California with less than $800,000.
