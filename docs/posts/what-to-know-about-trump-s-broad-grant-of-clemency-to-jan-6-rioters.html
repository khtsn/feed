Most of those defendants were convicted on sedition charges and were serving prison terms of up to 18 years. Under the commutations, their sentences will be reduced to time served.</p><p>In a separate but related move, Mr. Trump ordered his Justice Department to dismiss any criminal indictments that remained pending against Jan. 6 defendants. And he directed the Bureau of Prisons to “immediately implement” his clemency grants, meaning that the 240 or so rioters behind bars could be released as early as Monday night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-246de6b5">Misdemeanor Defendants</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s pardons and his demands for cases to be dismissed covered about 1,000 nonviolent offenders — the largest single group granted clemency. Those defendants were charged only with misdemeanor counts associated with the Capitol attack like breaching the restricted grounds of the Capitol or illegally entering the building itself, but were never accused of breaking anything or hurting anyone.</p><p>But even though they may not have committed acts of violence, a federal appeals court has ruled that each person who joined the mob on Jan. 6, “no matter how modestly behaved,” still contributed to the chaos at the Capitol.</p><p>Couy Griffin, a former local official from Otero County, N.M., was typical of defendants like this. Mr. Griffin, the founder of a group called Cowboys for Trump, was found guilty of illegally climbing over walls in the restricted grounds of the Capitol and sentenced to 14 days in prison.</p><p>Two years ago, Mr. Griffin was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/us/politics/jan-6-griffin-insurrection.html" title="">removed from his post</a> after a trial under the 14th Amendment’s prohibition on insurrectionists holding office. He was the first public official to be removed that way in more than a century.</p><h2 id="link-6445c1a7">Assault Cases</h2><p>The pardons and pending dismissals also covered more than 600 rioters were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers at the Capitol, nearly 175 of whom were accused of doing so with deadly or dangerous weapons including baseball bats, two-by-fours, crutches, hockey sticks and broken wooden table legs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The assault defendants have been sentenced to some of the longest prison terms of any of the Jan. 6 rioters. David Dempsey, a member of the Proud Boys from California, received the stiffest penalty for assault — 20 years in prison.</p><p>Prosecutors say Mr. Dempsey engaged in a sustained attack against multiple officers at the Capitol, using his hands, his feet, a flagpole, crutches, pepper spray and broken pieces of furniture.</p><p>Mr. Dempsey was so aggressive on Jan. 6 that at one point he assaulted a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him. He also stood beside a gallows outside the Capitol and called for the hanging of prominent Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama.</p><h2 id="link-1d9e3d4f">Conspiracy Cases</h2><p>The most prominent defendant convicted of conspiracy charges and pardoned by Mr. Trump was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/nyregion/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-pardon-jan-6.html" title="">Enrique Tarrio</a>, the former leader of the Proud Boys, who was found guilty of seditious conspiracy at a trial with four of his lieutenants.</p><p>Mr. Tarrio’s situation on Jan. 6 was unique. He was not in Washington that day, having been kicked out of the city days earlier by a local judge presiding over separate criminal charges brought against him for vandalizing a Black church a month before the Capitol attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Still, prosecutors said Mr. Tarrio kept in touch with compatriots as they assumed positions in the vanguard of the mob and played a central role in both committing violence and encouraging others to engage in violence at the Capitol.</p><p>Mr. Trump used a different method to grant clemency to Mr. Tarrio’s co-defendants in the sedition trial — Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zach Rehl and Dominic Pezzola, who is best known for having shattered one of the first windows at the Capitol with a stolen police riot shield. Mr. Trump commuted their sentences, reducing them from as much as 18 years in prison to time served. And he did the same for a former Proud Boy named Jeremy Bertino, who turned on his compatriots and testified against them at the trial.</p><p>Mr. Trump also commuted the 18-year sedition sentence imposed on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/stewart-rhodes-trump-jan-6-oath-keepers.html" title="">Stewart Rhodes</a>, the leader of the Oath Keepers, another far-right group that was instrumental in the riot. Eight other members of the Oath Keepers — most of them convicted of seditious conspiracy — had their sentences commuted as well.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
