With his brother, Mike French, he bought it at the end of 2014, with plans to improve the property over time.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“I was living in Portland, where I had a life and career, the whole thing,” Mr. French said. “So I was like, ‘Oh, I’m just going to do this cool little desert project.’”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. French and Mr. Cheong aimed to give the house a ’70s vibe with a shaggy sofa and rug, and squishy leather furniture.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Mottalini</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But as one visit to Pioneertown turned into many, “I just totally fell in love with it,” he said. “And I ended up staying.”</p><p>Mr. French and his brother, who lived in New York, began buying more properties in the area, which they gradually turned into hospitality destinations, including the Red Dog Saloon and a vacation rental cabin. They partnered with Eric Cheong, the founder of the design firm <a href="https://north45projects.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">North 45 Projects</a>, who had previously worked at Ace Hotel Group, and named their fledgling development company <a href="https://www.lifeandtimes.co/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Life &amp; Times</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A gold-and-porcelain orchid sits on a pedestal at the entrance to the bedroom wing.

In a game of musical homes, they moved into the house that would eventually become Mr. French’s home while they worked on the other one for his brother with Mr. Cheong. When that one was complete, Mr. French moved into the rental cabin they had recently refurbished, and they began gut renovating his 2,200-square-foot, three-bedroom house in January 2021.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The primary bathroom shower is finished in tadelakt plaster and copper.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Mottalini</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The powder room has terracotta-colored Japanese tile and curtains made from vintage fabric.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Mottalini</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It was a deeply personal project for me,” Mr. French said. “I wanted something that felt very unique, with western and desert influences,” as well as a home that felt “very, very cozy.”</p><p>When designing hotels and restaurants, Mr. Cheong said, the group typically starts with a mood board and a concept narrative. “We didn’t have any of that on this,” he said, noting that the process was more organic, as one decision led to the next while the friends embraced various vintage finds, materials and finishes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>They began by designing the kitchen, where they installed marigold-colored cabinets and wrapped the upper walls, ceiling and refrigerator in wood paneling.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span> In the kitchen, they installed marigold-colored cabinets and wood paneling.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Mottalini</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For the adjacent dining room, they found a vintage brass 1970s German pendant lamp. “That suddenly brought this feeling of, ‘Oh, we can bring in reflectivity and start thinking about a chic ’70s atmosphere,” Mr. Cheong said.</p><p>Pushing a plush ’70s vibe in the living room, they added a wood-burning fireplace and shelving in niches with rounded corners, finished in creamy Marmorino plaster. At the center of the room, they placed a vintage brass coffee table sprouting numerous glass tops by Milo Baughman on a shaggy brown buffalo hide, and added a sheepskin-covered sofa and squishy leather armchairs.</p><p>Through a doorway, they created a listening room, where a wall of wood shelving holds an extensive collection of vinyl records and quirky finds Mr. French has collected, from a brass cowboy boot to a preserved scorpion he bought at Deyrolle, a taxidermy shop in Paris. A pocket door also slides back to reveal a wet bar lined in floral wallpaper and mirror.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Built-in wood shelves in the listening room hold Mr. French’s extensive record collection and oddities he has collected over the years.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Mottalini</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>After designing the primary bedroom and a guest bedroom, the friends converted what had been a third bedroom into a studio and meditation space, painting the walls dusty pink and adding a grid of small wall shelves intended to cast changing shadows as the day progresses.

But one day, near the end of the renovation, he was working on his laptop when he looked down to find a snake between his feet.</p><p>“That led us to install a Dutch door,” Mr. Cheong said. “That way, you can keep the snakes out, but keep the friendly folks coming in.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The house, and hot tub, encourage indoor-outdoor living.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Mottalini</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>The transformation was finally complete in May 2022, at a cost of about $400,000.</p><p>The result is “a total dream house for me,” Mr. French said. “It’s so well aligned with this life I’ve created in the desert. It’s very much a personal expression of who I am and what I’m doing.”</p><p>For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/realestate/" title="">sign up here</a>.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
