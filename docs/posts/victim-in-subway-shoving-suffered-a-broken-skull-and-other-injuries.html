A judge ordered that Mr. Hawkins be held in jail until his next court date on Jan. 6.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The suspect, Kamel Hawkins, had a string of arrests that include violent offenses.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dakota Santiago for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Lynskey, a D.J. who performs under the name Joe Usher, is also the head of content and music programming at Gray V, a company that creates background music and playlists for hotels, restaurants, gyms and retail businesses.</p><p>According to his online bio, Mr. Lynskey was born and raised in Miami, where he began “honing his sound” during the 1990s in the South Beach and Design District areas.</p><p>“After a move to Manhattan, he began an eclectic journey through some of New York’s best underground clubs,” Mr. Lynskey’s bio says. He produced soundtracks for fashion houses’ runway shows and provided music for events held by major companies and at clubs across the United States and in Brazil and Costa Rica, his bio says.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Surveillance video of the attack shows Mr. Lynskey in a light orange jacket standing near the edge of the southbound platform at the 18th Street station in Chelsea. He appears to be looking down at his phone when a man in a dark coat passes behind him.</p><p>The man in the dark coat doubles back and violently shoves the victim off the platform just as the train passes through.</p><p>Hours later, on <a href="https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1874235752566984921" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>, Mayor Eric Adams called the incident an “appalling act of violence” that “has absolutely no place on our subway system.”</p><p>“Random acts of violence like this contribute to New Yorkers feeling unsettled,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Hawkins had a string of arrests for assault, harassment and weapons possession, according to police and court records. He has an open case in Brooklyn criminal court, where he is facing harassment and assault charges for throwing bleach on a woman and trying to kick down her door, according to a criminal complaint.</p><p>His father, Shamel Spencer, 40, who lives with Mr. Hawkins in an apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, said in an interview Wednesday that he was stunned by the accusations against his son.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Spencer, who went to court on Wednesday to see his child, acknowledged that Mr. Hawkins had run-ins with the law. Still, he said, he would never have expected his son to be accused of such a violent act.</p><p>“He’s not a bad kid at all,” said Mr. Spencer, who spoke somberly in the doorway of their home. Mr. Hawkins works for a moving company and is “usually focused and work-driven.”</p><p>But in recent weeks, Mr. Spencer said, he had become increasingly worried about his son’s mental health. He said Mr. Hawkins often smokes marijuana, and he wondered whether it had affected his ability to reason.</p><p>Mr. Spencer said he had been seeking help for his son. “I just know right now he’s not himself,” he said.</p><p>Surviving a shove off a New York City subway platform as a train arrives is rare.

She walked away with a fractured chin, a broken arm and a broken nose.

It was calculated and timed so that it would extinguish Joe’s life.”</p><p>He said the crime should add urgency to the coming legislative session. “This is just the latest wake-up call for our leaders, about the failures in our mental health and criminal justice systems,” he said. “This clearly has to be the focus of the upcoming legislative session in Albany — the systemic failures at the intersection of criminal justice and mental health.”</p><p>Michael Rothfeld<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
