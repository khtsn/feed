He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/politics/biden-hurricane-helene-florida-georgia.html" title="">promised that the federal government would not abandon the communities</a> that were damaged by one of the deadliest storms in American history.</p><p>Most of the 198 reported deaths — a figure that officials expect to rise — occurred far from Florida, where the storm first made landfall. Many of the hardest-hit areas were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/hurricane-helene-warnings-alerts.html" title="">in and around western North Carolina</a>, where residents were not prepared to evacuate.</p><p>The heavy toll of hurricanes far away from the coastline is not new. From 2013 to 2022, more than half of deaths attributed to tropical cyclones were caused by inland flooding. “Inland deaths are growing because there’s too much focus on the coast,” a former FEMA administrator said, adding that he expected more discussion about the use of mandatory evacuation orders in inland areas.</p><p>Several towns were left without food, water, phone service or gas. Supplies are now flowing into many of the most ravaged areas, but language barriers made it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/helene-north-carolina-latino-swannanoa.html" title="">difficult for some Latino communities to find support</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Liz Cheney in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-44e65baa">Cheney aims to help Harris appeal to conservatives</h2><p>Kamala Harris is campaigning this evening alongside Liz Cheney, the most prominent Republican to cross party lines and endorse her. They are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/politics/liz-cheney-kamala-harris.html" title="">holding an event together in Ripon, Wis.</a>, the symbolic birthplace of the Republican Party.</p><p>Cheney agrees with Harris on very little politically, aside from their distaste for Donald Trump. Her appearance with the Democratic candidate in a battleground state is an attempt to appeal to Republican and independent voters who are repelled by Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Israeli airstrike on the town of Khiam, Lebanon, today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Carl Court/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-39bf5ce2">Israel expanded its evacuation orders in southern Lebanon</h2><p>The Israeli military today urged the evacuation of more than 20 additional towns and villages in southern Lebanon, where its troops are fighting Hezbollah militants. The move appeared to be a sign that the ground invasion that Israeli forces began this week could be expanding.</p><p>The Israeli military said it had struck about 200 sites in Lebanon overnight. Lebanese health officials also said the death toll from an Israeli strike near the heart of Beirut had risen to at least nine people. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/03/world/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At least 1,400 of the Secret Service’s 7,800 employees left in 2022 and 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-220d4376">An exodus of agents left the Secret Service unprepared</h2><p>The Secret Service knew that 2024 would be a big year. There would be presidential campaigns, political conventions and a NATO summit on top of the typical threats. But the agency wasn’t ready: More agents left the service in 2022 and 2023 than at any point in decades.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/us/politics/secret-service-staffing-retention-hiring.html" title="">We talked to dozens of former agents</a> about the punishing hours, dilapidated facilities and lackluster leadership that prompted them to depart, leaving the agency unprepared to respond to an assassination attempt against Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An AMC novelty drink for “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Colin Clark for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-629283de">Can wacky cocktails save the movies?</h2><p>Movie theaters have been struggling with declining attendance for decades. But this summer, AMC earned more from concessions on the weekend “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” was released than at any point since 2019, in large part because moviegoers were quick to buy a pair of superhero-themed cocktails.</p><p>Similar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/dining/movie-theater-food-concessions.html" title="">limited-edition drinks and popcorn buckets</a>, as well as popcorn alternatives like Korean gochujang wings or chocolate-hazelnut-filled churros, have recently become ubiquitous at theaters looking to entice viewers who might otherwise have waited a few weeks to stream a film.</p><p><strong>In theaters this weekend: </strong>The new sequel to the award-winning “Joker” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/movies/joker-folie-a-deux-review.html" title="">is seriously un-fun</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Brooklyn Open at Marine Park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tony Cenicola/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-3aaafd30">A bartender, a firefighter and a Giuliani walk onto a fairway</h2><p>The Brooklyn Open is by turns a golf competition and a block party.

But the deeper the space travel, the more difficult it is to pack enough freeze-dried meals to sustain the crew. So a group of engineers came up with an alternative food source that they believe is better than trying to farm: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/science/asteroids-food-space.html" title="">space rocks</a>.</p><p>The astronauts wouldn’t chomp down on the asteroids. Instead, they would break the rocks down into their components and feed them to bacteria, resulting in a “biomass” with nutritional properties similar to Earth food.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Have an inventive evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
