Her order barred two dozen federal agencies from moving ahead with the largest phase of President Trump’s efforts to downsize the government.</p><p>In the emergency application filed on Friday, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, argued that the lower court&#39;s “far-reaching order” would prevent “almost the entire executive branch from formulating and implementing plans to reduce the size of the federal work force.”</p><p>That decision was “based on the extraordinary view” that the president lacked the authority to direct executive agencies on how to conduct large-scale downsizing plans, Mr. Sauer said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Illston’s ruling would prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development from carrying out layoffs it had planned for Sunday.</p><p>The request to the justices was the 15th emergency application that the administration filed to the Supreme Court since Mr. Trump returned to office in January. The applications have included asking the justices to lift a nationwide pause on Mr. Trump’s order ending birthright citizenship, to freeze more than $1 billion in foreign aid and to permit the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador without due process.</p><p>In February, Mr. Trump signed <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/14/2025-02762/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an executive order</a> directing officials to draft plans for “large-scale” cuts to the federal work force. Several labor unions, advocacy groups and local governments sued, seeking to block the order.</p><p>Judge Illston held an emergency hearing in the case last Friday and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/federal-layoffs-trump-ruling.html" title="">issued her ruling</a> just hours later.</p><p>In the 42-page ruling, Judge Illston determined that the government’s attempt to lay off workers and shut down offices and programs created an urgent threat to scores of critical services. She also noted that the process <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/903" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required consultation</a> with Congress on any plan to abolish or transfer part of a federal agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Monday, the Trump administration filed an emergency request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking it to pause Judge Illston’s order pending appeal. But the administration told the Supreme Court that such a ruling would not come quickly enough.</p><p>Of the many lawsuits filed in response to Mr. Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government, the mass layoffs case is poised to have the broadest effect. Many agencies have not yet announced downsizing plans, but employees throughout the government have been anxiously awaiting announcements.</p><p>Eileen Sullivan<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times.
