That song’s called “Ameriican Requiem,” so the cemetery is everywhere. And yet partway through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/movies/michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-interview-sinners.html" title="">Ryan Coogler’s</a> hit “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler.html" title="">Sinners,</a>” I thought, <em>Oh, this is where ‘here’ is</em>, inside a movie about a 1932 juke joint whose music is so soulful that vampires, who are also a white minstrel trio, want to suck its blood.</p><p>She’s envisioning utopia — a place where a Black woman feels free to make any kind of music she wants, including country. He’s imagined a nightmare in which Black art is doomed to be coveted before it’s ever just simply enjoyed. She’s defying the gatekeepers. He’s arguing that some gates definitely need to be kept. To that end, the movie keeps a gag running wherein vampire etiquette requires a verbal invitation to enter the club, leading to comic scenes of clearly possessed, increasingly itchy soul junkies standing in a doorway begging to be let in. People have been calling certain white performers interested in Black music vampires for years. Here’s a movie that literalizes the metaphor with an audacity that’s thrilling in its obviousness and redundancy.</p><p>There’s never a bad time for good pop art. There’s never a bad time for Black artists to provide it. But these here times? Times of hatchet work and so-called wood-chipping; of chain saws, as both metaphor and dispiriting political prop; a time of vandalistic racial gaslighting. <em>These</em> times might call for an excessive pop art that takes on too much, that wants to be gobbled up <em>and </em>dug into, an art that isn’t afraid to boast <em>I am this country</em>, while also doing some thinking about what this country is. These here times might call for Black artists to provide that, too, to offer an American education that feels increasingly verboten. That’s not art’s strong suit, pointing at chalkboards. But if school systems are being bullied into coddling snowflakes, then perhaps, on occasion, art should be hitting you upside the head and dancing on your nose.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Beyoncé on the opening night of her “Cowboy Carter” tour in Los Angeles last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now, it’s true that the knobbiest moments on “Cowboy Carter” and in “Sinners” are the equivalent of diagramed sentences. The album uses elders to do its explaining. Before “Spaghettii” gets underway, the singer and songwriter Linda Martell stops by to dissertate on the limitation of genres; Dolly Parton connects her “Jolene” to the home-wrecker in Beyoncé’s now nine-year-old “Sorry”; and Willie Nelson, as the D.J. on KNTRY, Beyoncé’s fictional broadcast network, turns his dial past some real chestnuts to tee up “Texas Hold ’Em.” They’re vouching for the validity of her project’s scope and sincerity, while, especially in Martell’s case, spelling everything out.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The spelling in “Sinners” happens right in the middle of its young protagonist’s first big blues number. Earlier, we’d gotten a taste of what Sammie (Miles Caton), a preacher’s boy, could do. Caton’s molasses baritone and impaling guitar work were really doing it for me when the sound muffles, and in come not one but two micro lectures about this music’s power to “pierce the veil between the present and the past.” And as these explanations of Black music tumble forth, I was surprised to find a very <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/100000010140961/sinners-scene.html" title="">Funkadelic</a> fellow making love to an electric guitar right next to Sammie. Over by the kitchen twerks a woman arguably conjured from some extremely City Girls place. The temperature of instruments changes from live drums to what sound like drum machines. And I soon spy dashikied tribesmen, b-boys, a ballerina and, I’m pretty sure, a decked-out Chinese folk singer, and they’re all gettin’ in the way of the blues.</p><p>The number ends with the club on actual but also metaphorical and premonitory fire (a scene later we’re back inside an intact juke joint). Amid the fantastical inferno, everyone dances around Sammie. This wrinkle in time is the event that lures the vampires. And I wish it had moved me, the conflation of history and genre, this hat-tipping compendium of Black artistry, especially while we’re being instructed that these kinds of artists are the bedrock of American popular music. What we’ve got here is <em>too</em> chalkboard.</p><p>It’s not explication that illuminates the movie or album, which Beyoncé is touring behind now. It’s a subtle and still gluttonous imagination. “Cowboy Carter” insists that if an African-American’s taking it on — gospel, trap, Pacific Coast Highway pop or whatever naughty ’60s variety show her “Ya Ya” has bulls-eyed — we’re talking about a kind of country music. It doesn’t matter how much Albert Murray I’ve read — that insistence still feels revelatory for me.</p><p>Murray, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/books/albert-murray-essayist-who-challenged-the-conventional-dies-at-97.html" title="">died in 2013</a>, was one of the country’s most essential thinkers about the grist and glory of Black American life, how Black music is fundamentally, irrefutably American music. It wasn’t country, per se, that animated Murray’s social philosophy. It’s what’s in country’s DNA, what’s at the heart of “Sinners”: the blues. His two supreme works of criticism are “The Omni-Americans,” from 1970, and “Stomping the Blues,” from 1976. I don’t know how much Murray Coogler has taken in. But his movie’s alive with the blues as an ethos of Black life. “U.S. Negro music represents far more,” Murray wrote in “Omni-Americans,” “than the fact that American black folks been ’buked and scorned and nobody know the trouble dey seen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sammie, center, gets a big blues moment in a pivotal scene in the juke joint.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Warner Bros. </span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The blues, especially, “affirm not only U.S. Negro life in all of its arbitrary complexities and not only life in America in all of its infinite confusions, they affirm life and humanity itself in the very process of confronting failures and existentialistic absurdities. The spirit of the blues moves in the opposite direction from ashes and sackcloth, self-pity, self-hatred, and suicide. As a matter of fact the dirtiest, meanest, and most lowdown blues are not only not depressing, they function like an instantaneous aphrodisiac!”</p><p>That’s all over the first hour of “Sinners.” All that really happens is that two Michael B. Jordans, playing twin brothers, open the juke joint. They purchase the land, recruit the talent, procure the provisions, cut deals, mend emotional fences. It’s a warm, humorous, sexed, sexy stretch of moviemaking that earns our trust and lures our dread: I mean, when’s all this good feeling (one twin shoots two dudes, then we laugh) and catfish and lowdown living getting doomed? Coogler’s given himself a mess of rules to bend and adhere to: those of vampires, arguably zombie movies too, Jim Crow, the musical, the music <em>video</em>, the western, what Quentin Tarantino would call the revenge-o-matic, griot culture, church dogma, passing for white, passing for alive.</p><p>But it’s Murray who’s coming through loud and clear, even after the vampires show up armed with banjo, fiddle and guitar, claiming to have come all this way to hear such beautiful, powerful, undeniable music. The blues is some intangible quality that inheres within this depiction of Blackness, the way camp does in certain queer art. That snarling “Ya Ya” song on “Cowboy Carter” is a kind of prime-time blues number that Beyoncé rides with no saddle.</p><p>But these are both works worried about the legacy of a people and a way of life, of the blues as an art form and an exuberant state of mind, all on the brink on extinction. This work is fighting — occasionally with itself. But Beyoncé and Coogler have sensed that something vital is at stake right now, and it might be the fabric of history; their work knows those histories have always been in jeopardy.</p><p>If the minstrels in “Sinners” are also vampires, and the vampires want to steal Black art, they’re not going very far with it. They mosh and jig around in the dirt, 200 feet from the juke joint, encircling the head vampire, a white Irishman who goes by Remmick (Jack O’Connell) and has real lead-singer-if-the-band-was-a-cult energy. They look like they’re having a sexy time and probably smell like teen spirit. The movie’s set at the dawn of the recording industry, and yet the allegory doesn’t feel like a stand-in for copyright infringement but a crisis of faith.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Remmick tells the Black and Chinese-American revelers that <em>his</em> people “believe in equality in music” — perhaps he says “equality <em>and</em> music.” Either way, that sounds like a certain politician’s pitch to a people he’s deemed hopeless: <em>What do you have to lose? </em>Obviously, this path to Kumbaya is paved with gnarled necks, which allows us to appreciate the movie’s devastating critique of the options. Jim Crow or your soul.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kendrick Lamar, left, and the actor Samuel L. Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, at the Super Bowl half time show in February in New Orleans.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ashley Landis/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>THIS IS, I SUPPOSE,</strong> what Kendrick Lamar had been trying to tell us back in February with that Super Bowl <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-review.html" title="">halftime show</a>. It, too, luxuriated in excess and chalkboard entertainment. He aimed the bulk of his 13 minutes at an appropriation of all sorts of American iconography: Samuel L. Jackson, say, dressed in a starred bow tie, red vest and stars-and-stripes top hat, embodying, to quote him, “ya Uncle Sam.” Only this Sam was also a finger-wagging hype man who exhorted Lamar not to go too far in front of all of these white eyes and respectability politicians, in turn daring him to turn Murray’s aphrodisiac into a Molotov cocktail. Ya Uncle Sam was both a devil on the shoulder and a winking Jim Crow cartoon whom, for the length of the show, Lamar never acknowledged but was nonetheless compelled to ostentatiously defy.</p><p>The suspense that night was whether Lamar would trot out “Not Like Us,” the year-old banger that detonated Drake’s aura of cool by, among other things, racially redefining this Black Canadian Jew as a “colonizer.” The suspense is built into the set. Ya Uncle Sam keeps begging Lamar not to perform it, as if to say, <em>Please, no Black-on-Black violence here.</em> (And certainly not with the pending lawsuit that Drake has filed.) Lamar’s decision to proceed seems set up to appear doubly insurgent. Damn the lawyers. Damn this minstrel fool.</p><p>It’s funny, though; “Not Like Us” begins with Lamar whispering, ”I see dead people,” as a warning to a doomed Drake, his Remmick, perhaps. But he omitted it from the Super Bowl show — an excess too far maybe. Instead, he replaces it with two of his own lyrics: “40 acres and a mule/ This is bigger than the music” and “They tried to rig the game, but you can’t fake influence.” (From above, you could see the set was lit to resemble a tic-tac-toe grid.) For a few seconds, rather than invoke the figurative dead, he opted to clarify the stakes of his show. The song’s about Drake. But Lamar insists it’s about also interlopers, pillagers and bad-faith collaborators, about thieves and opportunists. Vampires. He was being petty that night, but his pettiness had achieved righteousness.</p><p>It’s been almost 200 years since minstrelsy, in its blackface form, exploded in the United States, and some of our most popular Black artists are still contending with its ghosts, still clashing over the stories we’re telling about how we got to this moment and who helped us arrive. If some peculiar forces are ripping up our roots, it’s probably not enough to simply celebrate. Maybe those roots truly do belong on a chalkboard, twerking in our faces, on the nose, wrinkling time.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Wesley Morris is a Times critic who writes about art and popular culture.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/beyonce">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/kendrick-lamar">Kendrick Lamar</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore More in TV and Movies</h2><h3>Not sure what to watch next?
