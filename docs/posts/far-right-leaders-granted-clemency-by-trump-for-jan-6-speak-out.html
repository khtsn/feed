    <h1>Far-Right Leaders Granted Clemency by Trump for Jan. 6 Speak Out</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fresh from being freed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6.html" title="">President Trump’s sweeping grants of clemency</a>, two of the nation’s most notorious far-right leaders — Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys and Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers militia — spoke out this week.</p><p>While the men avoided any declarations about the future of their battered organizations, they asserted unrepentantly that they wanted Mr. Trump to seek revenge on their behalf for being prosecuted in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p><p>Before Mr. Trump offered them a reprieve on Monday night, both men had been serving lengthy prison terms — Mr. Tarrio 22 years and Mr. Rhodes 18 years — on seditious conspiracy convictions arising from the roles they played in the storming of the Capitol. The charges they faced and the punishment they got were among the most serious imposed against any of the nearly 1,600 people prosecuted in connection with Jan. 6.</p><p>Perhaps for that reason, their remarks, made to largely friendly audiences, were couched in a tone of cautious belligerence.</p></div></div>
