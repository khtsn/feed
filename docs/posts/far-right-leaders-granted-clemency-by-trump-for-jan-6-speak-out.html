The charges they faced and the punishment they got were among the most serious imposed against any of the nearly 1,600 people prosecuted in connection with Jan. 6.</p><p>Perhaps for that reason, their remarks, made to largely friendly audiences, were couched in a tone of cautious belligerence.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>They were cagey about what sort of profile the organizations they once led would strike in a second Trump administration. But they clearly echoed assertions by the president and some of his allies that those who sought to hold Mr. Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters accountable should themselves face some sort of punishment.</p><p>“Success,” Mr. Tarrio said, “is going to be retribution.”</p><p>Mr. Tarrio made those comments to Alex Jones, the pro-Trump conspiracy theorist and proprietor of the news outlet Infowars. He called in to Mr. Jones’s show just hours after getting out of a federal prison in Louisiana and immediately thanked Mr. Trump “for helping us through these difficult times and releasing me.”</p><p>“Twenty-two years — this is not a short sentence,” he said. “That’s the rest of my life. So Trump literally gave me my life back.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, arriving in Miami.

While Mr. Tarrio was not in Washington that day, prosecutors say he helped prepare his compatriots for street fights and remained in touch with them while the mob — with the Proud Boys in the lead — overran the Capitol.</p><p>In his first hours of freedom, he was also focused on seeking vengeance against those who investigated and prosecuted the events of Jan. 6. “Now it’s our turn,” Mr. Tarrio declared.</p><p>“The people who did this, they need to feel the heat,” he said. “They need to be put behind bars and they need to be prosecuted.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>At a White House news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Trump was asked whether far-right groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers would now have a place in the political conversation given his expansive efforts to pardon their members or commute their sentences.</p><p>“Well, we have to see,” Mr. Trump replied. “They’ve been given a pardon. I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.”</p><p>Mr. Rhodes also said he was looking for payback when he showed up on Tuesday afternoon at the local jail in Washington that has held several Jan. 6 defendants over the years and has served as the emotion focal point of protest against the federal prosecutions of the rioters.</p><p>He said, for instance, that he hoped Kash Patel, Mr. Trump’s pick to run the F.B.I., would “get in there and clean house” at the bureau. He also accused the people who oversaw his trial of breaking the law.</p><p>“What has to happen first,” Mr. Rhodes said, “is that the prosecutors who suborned perjury — that’s a crime — need to be prosecuted for their crimes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At his sentencing hearing in 2023, Mr. Rhodes defiantly declared that he was “a political prisoner,” comparing himself to the Soviet-era dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and to the beleaguered main character in the Kafka novel “The Trial.”</p><p>Outside the D.C. jail, he was equally unremorseful. When asked how history should remember Jan. 6, he said, “As Patriots’ Day — that we stood up for our country because we knew the election was stolen.”</p><p>As for any regrets, he said he had none, adding, “Because we did the right thing.”</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Rhodes was spotted at the Dunkin’ Donuts in the Longworth House Office Building next to the Capitol.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crowd gathered outside the Central Detention Facility in Washington on Monday night, after President Trump announced he would pardon people involved in the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The Jan. 6 prosecutions devastated the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers as federal agents across the country arrested scores of people from both groups and prosecutors tried and convicted dozens of their members — often with the help of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/22/us/politics/proud-boys-jan-6-trial.html" title="">turncoats</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/08/us/politics/oath-keepers-trial-january-6.html" title="">informants</a> from within the organizations.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Oath Keepers in particular can be barely said to exist any longer as a viable entity. And while the Proud Boys dissolved their national leadership group — known as the Elders Chapter — under the weight of the Jan. 6 investigation, many of the group’s local chapters remain active.</p><p>Indeed, on Inauguration Day, rank-and-file Proud Boys descended in numbers on Washington for the first time since Jan. 6, marching with a banner congratulating Mr. Trump on his return to the White House. The display of presence on the streets — especially the streets of Washington — suggested that some within the Proud Boys wanted to make a public show of strength.</p><p>Mr. Tarrio, however, was somewhat circumspect about the group’s future, delivering his standard answer about the organization.</p><p>“I think the future of the club is going to be what it’s always been,” he said, “just a group of men that love America, get around and drink beer and protect Trump supporters from being assaulted.”</p><p>As for his own role in the group, he offered a typical winking reply.</p><p>“I do have a suggestion for the mainstream media,” he said. “They should stop calling me the ex-Proud Boys leader.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Rhodes was equally evasive — though perhaps not quite as smug.</p><p>He said he did not know what the future of the Oath Keepers would be, admitting that “I might just decide to hang up my spurs.”</p><p>At any rate, he went on, he had other things to think about at the moment. When a reporter outside the D.C. jail asked him what was the first thing he planned to do when he got home, his answer was quick and simple.</p><p>“I’m going to report to my probation officer,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
