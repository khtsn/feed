    <h1>Trump Raised $239 Million for Inauguration, More Than Doubling His Own Record</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The three largest contributions came from a poultry producer, Pilgrim’s, which donated $5 million; a crypto company, Ripple Inc., which donated just under that; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/britain-ambassador-trump-stephens.html" title="">Warren Stephens</a>, a Republican donor who gave $4 million on the same day, Dec. 2, that Mr. Trump named him as his pick to be ambassador to Britain.</p><p>Inaugurations, even with several days of elaborate dinners and other events, have never cost anything near roughly a quarter-billion dollars, and the amount raised by the committee will resurface questions about where any leftover funds might go. The committee has not said how much money it has spent, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/politics/trump-inaugural-donations.html" title="">president’s allies have said</a> that the remaining amount will be funneled to other Trump-sponsored projects, primarily a nonprofit organization that will build his presidential library.</p><p>Contributions to inaugural festivities have long been used by corporate interests to cultivate allies in an incoming administration, but the amount raised by Mr. Trump is exceedingly high by historical standards. George W. Bush, for instance, collected $30 million in 2001 (roughly $55 million in today’s dollars). Four years ago, Joseph R. Biden Jr. collected $62 million (nearly $76 million in 2025 dollars) for his inauguration, though that celebration was pared down because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>President Trump’s total in 2017 was twice as much as any president-elect had ever raised for an inauguration. The $346 million raised by his two inaugural committees is more than the nominal amount raised by all other inaugural committees combined since Richard M. Nixon’s $4 million in 1973.</p><p>The haul this year by Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee was so large that some seven-figure donors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trump-inauguration-donors.html" title="">were not guaranteed access to premier events</a> because those functions were full. Mr. Trump’s committee accepted a total of roughly $245 million, but issued about $6 million in refunds, including a $50,000 check from the Miss Universe Organization, which Mr. Trump used to own.</p></div></div>
