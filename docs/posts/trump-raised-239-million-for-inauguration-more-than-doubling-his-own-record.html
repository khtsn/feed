About 140 different people or companies gave at least $1 million to the effort, including blue-chip companies like JPMorgan Chase, Delta Air Lines and Target.</p><p>The committee, known formally as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, is required by federal law to report the names of donors and the dollar amounts for contributions over $200 to the F.E.C. no more than 90 days after the Jan. 20 ceremony. It is not required to report how it spent the money.</p><p>Many of the donations to Mr. Trump’s inauguration were previously announced — such as $1 million each from tech giants like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/meta-trump-inaugural-fund-donation.html" title="">Meta</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/technology/amazon-trump-inauguration.html" title="">Amazon</a> — in part because companies wanted it known widely that they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/technology/tech-ceos-lobbying-trump.html" title="">backing Mr. Trump’s formal return to power</a>. But the report revealed a few names not well-publicized, including several friends of Elon Musk, such as tech investors like John Hering, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/elon-musk-donald-trump-greenland.html" title="">Ken Howery</a> and Keith Rabois, who each gave $1 million. (Neither Mr. Musk, a top presidential adviser, nor any of his companies donated.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The three largest contributions came from a poultry producer, Pilgrim’s, which donated $5 million; a crypto company, Ripple Inc., which donated just under that; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/britain-ambassador-trump-stephens.html" title="">Warren Stephens</a>, a Republican donor who gave $4 million on the same day, Dec. 2, that Mr. Trump named him as his pick to be ambassador to Britain.</p><p>Inaugurations, even with several days of elaborate dinners and other events, have never cost anything near roughly a quarter-billion dollars, and the amount raised by the committee will resurface questions about where any leftover funds might go. The committee has not said how much money it has spent, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/politics/trump-inaugural-donations.html" title="">president’s allies have said</a> that the remaining amount will be funneled to other Trump-sponsored projects, primarily a nonprofit organization that will build his presidential library.</p><p>Contributions to inaugural festivities have long been used by corporate interests to cultivate allies in an incoming administration, but the amount raised by Mr. Trump is exceedingly high by historical standards. George W. Bush, for instance, collected $30 million in 2001 (roughly $55 million in today’s dollars). Four years ago, Joseph R. Biden Jr. collected $62 million (nearly $76 million in 2025 dollars) for his inauguration, though that celebration was pared down because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>President Trump’s total in 2017 was twice as much as any president-elect had ever raised for an inauguration. The $346 million raised by his two inaugural committees is more than the nominal amount raised by all other inaugural committees combined since Richard M. Nixon’s $4 million in 1973.</p><p>The haul this year by Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee was so large that some seven-figure donors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trump-inauguration-donors.html" title="">were not guaranteed access to premier events</a> because those functions were full. Mr. Trump’s committee accepted a total of roughly $245 million, but issued about $6 million in refunds, including a $50,000 check from the Miss Universe Organization, which Mr. Trump used to own.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Theodore Schleifer is a Times reporter covering billionaires and their impact on the world.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Iran Nuclear Talks</strong><strong>: </strong>As the administration grapples with how to stop Iran’s nuclear program, it has so far left a trail of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html">mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Housing Aid:</strong> The White House is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/housing-aid-hud-federal-budget.html">deep cuts to federal housing programs</a>, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, in a reconfiguration that could jeopardize millions of Americans’ access to rental assistance funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standoff Over Transgender Athletes:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-sues-maine-trans-athletes-womens-sports.html">sued Maine</a> over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, just days after also threatening to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disinformation Office Shuttered:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio shut down a State Department office that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-rubio-state-department-foreign-disinformation.html">tracks and counters global disinformation</a>, including campaigns by rival powers of the United States and terrorist groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Deals With Law Firms:</strong> To avoid retribution, some of the nation’s biggest law firms agreed to deals with President Trump to provide free legal services for uncontroversial causes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">Now he wants more from them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Changing Briefing Room: </strong>For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/15/us/trump-white-house-briefing-room-new-media.html">the seating chart in the White House press briefing room has been controlled</a> by an independent organization.
