For them, the swirl of emotions is complicated but bone deep as memories flood back from those dark days.</p><p>“There’s no doubt about it in my mind that if it weren’t for President Carter, I don’t think I would be here now,” Barry Rosen, 80, the press attaché at the embassy during the takeover, said in an interview from his home in New York. “He took the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune on our behalf, and he saved our lives.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To history, the Iran hostage crisis remains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/29/us/jimmy-carter#the-iran-hostage-crisis-helped-define-the-carter-presidency" title="">the emblem of a failed presidency</a>, a grievous wound to American stature around the world and a proximate cause of the electoral tidal wave that swept Mr. Carter out of the White House after a single term.</p><p>But to at least some of those who lived it, Mr. Carter remains a figure worthy of respect and admiration for his relentless determination to bring them home, even at the expense of his own political career.</p><p>“He did his best,” said Michael Metrinko, 78, a consular officer at the time. “He was dealing with a time of insanity — complete insanity, political insanity — on the part of the Iranians, on the part of a lot of Americans.”</p><p>Mark Bowden, the author of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/books/review/14traub.html" title="">“Guests of the Ayatollah</a>,” said most of the former hostages he had spoken with for his book were grateful to Mr. Carter “for his careful handling of an impossible situation.”</p><p>Still, over the years there has been a strain of anger among some of the former hostages that it took so long to secure their release. Some, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/world/middleeast/l-bruce-laingen-dead.html" title="">L. Bruce Laingen</a>, the chargé d’affairs and highest-ranking diplomat taken hostage, faulted Mr. Carter for precipitating the crisis by allowing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1980/07/28/archives/deposed-shah-dies-in-egypt-at-60-iran-says-death-will-not-affect.html" title="">Mohammed Reza Pahlavi</a>, the deposed shah, into the United States for cancer treatment, infuriating the Islamist militants who had taken over Iran.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“They saw it as needlessly provocative and were proved right,” Mr. Bowden said. Even so, he added, “their anger was reserved for Iran’s Islamist regime and for their captors but also for misguided Americans,” including liberal political figures, “who traveled to Tehran to participate in propaganda events orchestrated by the hostage takers.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A letter from President Jimmy Carter to one of the former hostages.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Courtesy of Rocky Sickmann</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is hard to convey to those too young to remember just how consuming the hostage crisis was. Americans were absorbed by the standoff and tied yellow ribbons around trees to demonstrate concern for the hostages. Network newscasts led off night after night with the latest developments, counting the number of days of that America had been “held hostage.” Mr. Carter brought much of this on himself by making freeing the hostages his top public priority, even refusing at first to campaign for re-election so he could concentrate on bringing them home.</p><p>The crisis had its origins in the Iranian revolution led by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/obituaries/ayatollah-ruhollah-khomeini-89-the-unwavering-iranian-spiritual-leader.html" title="Times obituary ">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</a>, who installed a radical religious order in Tehran. An ally of the United States, the shah went into exile in Mexico. But as his cancer worsened, Mr. Carter came under pressure to admit the shah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/world/middleeast/shah-iran-chase-papers.html" title="">from influential figures</a> like former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and the wealthy banker David Rockefeller.</p><p>Mr. Carter anticipated the consequences. “What are you guys going to advise me to do when they overrun our embassy now and take our people hostage?” he asked his staff, according to a book by his former aide, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/books/review/president-carter-stuart-eizenstat.html" title="">Stuart E. Eizenstat</a>. Yet despite his misgivings, Mr. Carter granted the shah’s request.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As Mr. Carter predicted, outraged Iranian militants <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000001479298/american-hostages-taken-in-iran.html" title="">stormed the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979</a>, taking Americans as captives. Mr. Carter responded by imposing sanctions on Iran, freezing its assets in the United States and embarking on months of painstaking diplomacy.</p><p>He ordered a military rescue attempt in April 1980, but the mission failed because of mechanical issues and a sandstorm, then turned into a disaster when a helicopter crashed into a plane in the Iranian desert, leading to the death of eight marines and airmen. After more months of stalemate, Americans, who had initially rallied behind Mr. Carter, turned on him and for that and other reasons elected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/us/ronald-reagan-dies-at-93-fostered-cold-war-might-and-curbs-on-government.html" title="">Ronald Reagan</a> in November.</p><p>Through it all, the hostages waited and worried. Some were beaten. Some were subjected to mock executions. All were cut off from the outside world.</p><p>“There was no communication,” recalled Rocky Sickmann, 67, then a Marine stationed at the embassy who now lives in St. Louis. “You were not allowed to speak. You just sat there tied up and listening through the broken windows. The city of Tehran, it would wake up in the morning, and you could hear the noise and you could hear the protests.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Sickmann said he was only allowed to go outside seven times during his more than 14 months in captivity. “You didn’t know if you were going to live or die, morning, noon or night,” he said. And he did not know if people back home even thought about them. “Who’s going to care?” he recalled thinking. “Little did I realize that everybody did care.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A yellow ribbon in celebration of the release of American hostages hung on the Superdome in New Orleans before Super Bowl XV on Jan. 25, 1981, just days after their release.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Focus on Sport, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The hostages understood something had happened when the rescue mission failed because suddenly they were moved and dispersed to thwart future attempts. But even today, some of them remain haunted by the American troops who died trying to save them.</p><p>“Every morning I wake up, I think of those eight,” said Mr. Sickmann, who now works for Folds of Honor, a nonprofit organization providing scholarships to children of fallen troops, police officers and firefighters. “Imagine: Those eight would never have the chance to have a son to go fishing with. Those eight would never have the chance to go to a father-daughter dance. Those eight would never have a chance to walk their daughter down the aisle. Those eight would never have grandchildren.”</p><p>Over the decades since, some of the hostages and plenty of others have suspected that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/books/the-case-for-a-conspiracy.html" title="">people around Mr. Reagan plotted</a> to discourage Iran from freeing the hostages before the election, knowing that such a release would benefit Mr. Carter. At the time, Mr. Reagan’s associates speculated publicly that Mr. Carter would engineer their release as an “October surprise” to fuel his own re-election campaign.</p><p>Last year, a new account revived the matter. Ben Barnes, a former lieutenant governor of Texas, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/us/politics/jimmy-carter-october-surprise-iran-hostages.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> that he unwittingly participated in an effort to delay the release of the hostages. Mr. Barnes said his mentor, former Gov. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/us/john-connally-of-texas-a-power-in-2-political-parties-dies-at-76.html" title="">John B. Connally Jr.</a> of Texas, who was angling for a post in a potential Reagan cabinet, invited him in 1980 to come along on a trip around the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>During meetings with leaders in the region, Mr. Barnes said, he was shocked to hear Mr. Connally urge them to convey the message to Iran not to release the hostages before the election, promising a better deal under Mr. Reagan. After returning home, Mr. Barnes said, Mr. Connally reported to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/obituaries/william-casey-ex-cia-head-is-dead-at-74.html" title="">William J. Casey</a>, the chairman of Mr. Reagan’s campaign and later director of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p><p>Mr. Connally and Mr. Casey have both died and confirming the account is difficult all these years later. But another book published this fall added more fuel to the fire. In “Den of Spies: Reagan, Carter and the Secret History of the Treason That Stole the White House,” Craig Unger, a longtime journalist, connects more dots, concluding that Mr. Casey helped sabotage efforts to free the hostages before the election.</p><p>Some of the former hostages remain convinced that they were used as pawns in a political game. But many also recalled Mr. Carter’s concern and attention, and how he got to know their families during the long ordeal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>L.

I personally wasn’t — I felt he made a promise to keep us alive. He made a promise to our families that he would get us out.
