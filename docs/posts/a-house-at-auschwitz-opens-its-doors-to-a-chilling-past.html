One reason, she said, was that she was disturbed by people who, after watching “The Zone of Interest,” were tramping through her garden, peering through her windows and reminding her of her home’s connection to the Holocaust.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Last summer, Ms. Jurczak agreed to sell her stake in the home to the <a href="https://www.counterextremism.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Counter Extremism Project,</a> a New York-based group that wants to open the house to visitors. She moved out in August, and in October the New York group completed its acquisition of the home and an adjacent house built after the war.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A woman stands in a kitchen." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/13/multimedia/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl/xxpoland-auschwitz-02-qckl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/50548df9-0cf0-5180-b27d-f7f466e1e6b5" decoding="async" width="600" height="450"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Grazyna Jurczak lived for 42 years in the three-story house overlooking a former gas chamber and a gallows at Auschwitz.

She declined to say how much the house was sold for, but indicated that it was somewhat more than the property’s estimated value of around $120,000.</p><p>Mark Wallace, a lawyer and former U.S. diplomat who is the chief executive of the Counter Extremism Project, also declined to give the price, saying only that once other family members were paid for their stakes in the property, the total price was “significantly more” than what Ms. Jurczak had indicated. He also said his organization “wanted to do right” by Ms. Jurczak’s family but “did not want to pay a big premium for a former Nazi property, even if we could.”</p><p>Now the house, at 88 Legionow Street, just outside the camp’s perimeter fence, is being prepared to receive visits by the public for the first time, as part of commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Army’s liberation of Auschwitz.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The <a href="http://auschwitz.org/en/" title="Museum website" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum</a>, a Polish institution in Oswiecim committed to the remembrance of Nazi victims, will be hosting dozens of world leaders on Jan. 27.</p><p>At the house, workers hired by the new owners have removed 14 dumpsters of debris and stripped away wallpaper and other postwar additions. That has left the property much as it was when the Höss family lived there from 1941 to late 1944, including the Nazi-era lock on the bathroom door reading “frei/besetzt.,” German for free/occupied.</p><p>A mezuzah, a parchment containing biblical verses, has been attached to the front door frame to honor Jewish tradition — and repudiate the fanaticism of its former occupant, the Auschwitz commander. After the war, Commandant Höss recalled how the successful experimental gassing of Russian prisoners in 1941 “set my mind at rest, for the mass extermination of the Jews was to start soon.”</p><p>He was hanged in 1947 at a gallows placed between his former home and a Nazi crematory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Torn and crumpled Nazi-era newspapers found in the house of the wartime camp commandant, Rudolf Höss.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>On a table in a downstairs corner room that Commandant Höss used as a home office lies a heap of torn and crumpled Nazi-era newspapers and other wartime artifacts found after the house was sold. There is also a coffee mug, embossed with the seal of the SS, and German beer bottles.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Retrieved from the attic, where they had been stuffed to block a hole, were the striped trousers once worn by an Auschwitz prisoner. Researchers are trying to work out who wore them by deciphering a faded prisoner number, written next to a small red triangle signifying that the wearer was a political prisoner and a nearly vanished yellow star designating a Jew.</p><p>“This house has been closed for 80 years. It was out of reach to the victims and their families. Finally, we can open it to honor survivors and show that this place of incredible evil is now open to all,” Mr. Wallace said.</p><p>The plan, Mr. Wallace said, is to turn the house, along with the adjacent property, into the Auschwitz Research Center on Hate, Extremism and Radicalization, a new organization that will work to expand the pledge of “Never Again” from historical memory to current action.</p><p>Piotr Cywinski, a Polish historian and director of the Auschwitz-Birkanau Museum since 2006, said his state-run institution wanted to preserve its core mission of remembrance but saw value in supporting a project focused on the present and future, as well as the past.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“Fighting against today’s reality is easier for an NGO than for a state institution,” he said, lamenting the rise across Europe of populism, which he calls “the cancer of democracy.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The view of Auschwitz from the house, the former home of the death camp’s wartime commandant, Rudolf Höss. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The new center will encompass the entire territory of Commandant Höss’s wartime property, including a long sealed-off garden area where he met with Hitler’s security chief, Heinrich Himmler, Josef Mengele, the “angel of death” doctor, and other Nazi dignitaries tasked with exterminating Jews. Daniel Libeskind, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/realestate/02sqft.html" title="">American architect,</a> has been commissioned to redesign the property.</p><p>Mr. Libeskind said he had drawn up preliminary plans that envisage turning the interior of the house into “a void, an abyss” — the external walls are protected by a <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/31/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNESCO preservation order</a> — and the construction of a new partly buried structure in a garden area with meeting rooms, a library and a data center.</p><p>More than two million people visit the former Auschwitz camp each year and, the architect said, come away “horrified and mesmerized by death” but also need “to engage with contemporary antisemitism and other extremism in our political culture.”</p><p>Jacek Purski, the director of a Polish anti-extremism group, who is involved in the project, said he wants to use the house and the past Nazi horrors as a weapon against what he sees as a resurgence of extremist ideologies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“A house is a house,” Mr. Purski said, looking out of a second-story window of the former Höss house toward the chimney of a former Nazi crematory. “But it is in uninteresting, regular houses like this where extremism is happening today.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“The last thing we want to do is create a museum to the murderer,” said Jacek Purski, the director of a Polish anti-extremism group who is involved in the project.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ms. Jurczak, the former owner, said she still struggles to reconcile happy, ordinary memories of the house with its gruesome past.</p><p>Reminiscing about her family’s time there she suddenly stopped herself: “I worry that I sound like Ms. Höss,” she said, referring to the commandant’s wife, Hedwig Höss. In the movie, Ms. Höss gushes about her Polish home as “paradise” and is shown trying on a fur coat stolen from a prisoner sent to slaughter by her husband.</p><p>The commandant’s wife, Ms. Jurczak decided after watching the movie, “was perhaps even worse than her husband,” in her indifference to human suffering.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>While awaiting execution in a Polish jail after the war, Mr. Höss, the former commandant, wrote an autobiography that Primo Levi, the Italian writer and Auschwitz survivor, described as the work of a “drab functionary” who “evolved step by step into one of the greatest criminals in history.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visitors to the Auschwitz concentration camp.

At least 1.1 million men, women and children were murdered there, mostly in gas chambers.</p><p>Grabbed by the SS as a home for the Auschwitz commandant, who changed the street number to 88, a numerical code for Heil Hitler, the house was returned to its original owner after the war and later sold to the family of Ms. Jurczak’s husband, who owned it until last year.</p><p>Mr. Cywinski, the Auschwitz-Birkanau museum director, said he was eager to work with the Counter Extremism Project, in its efforts to combat extremism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Extremism, he said, “is unfortunately not a mental illness; it is a method” that exploits widespread feelings of frustration.</p><p>Ordinary people with ordinary ambitions, he added, can turn into monsters.</p><p>Mr. Höss, he said, “was a wonderful father to his kids and, at the same time, the main organizer of the most brutal killings in the history of the world.”</p><p>Anatol Magdziarz<!-- --> contributed reporting from Warsaw.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
