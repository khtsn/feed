An iconic disco-pop outfit with a crossover hit often understood to be about gay cruising that has become a global sports-and-bar-mitzvah anthem.</p><p>These are the sorts of contradictory figures who have long animated and energized American pop music, the art form where competing interest groups and creative urges are in the closest quarters, and most likely to collide in unanticipatedly productive ways. The stew of American pop is messy, the result of centuries of creative crossover, willing and forced and sometimes unpredictable.</p><p>So maybe it’s not a surprise, then, that even onstage at President-elect Donald J. Trump’s Make America Great Again Victory Rally on Sunday afternoon at the Capital One Arena — seemingly a place inhospitable to these narratives of collaborative difference — these tugs of war persisted.</p><p>In the speeches — from Mr. Trump and many of his surrogates — there was nativism and isolationism and promises of record deportations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And yet for a party and movement built in part on exclusion and a campaign marked at times by race-baiting, there were conspicuous overtures to diversity and inclusion, and sly acknowledgments of the power of the multiracial stew of American pop.</p><p>There was Kid Rock, his voice pockmarked and powerful, singing “All Summer Long,” his winning invocation of “Sweet Home Alabama,” before putting on a red Make America Great Again ball cap and taking a turn scratching on his D.J.’s turntable. In a video message during the performance, Mr. Trump promised to Make America Rock Again, interspersed with footage of Run-DMC songs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kid Rock performing at Mr. Trump’s rally at Capital One Arena.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Billy Ray Cyrus, who was billed as one of the performers at the rally but who wasn’t heard apart from sound checking, would have deepened this curious narrative as a former country pretty boy rescued in late career by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/magazine/lil-nas-x.html" title="">working with a queer hip-hop newcomer</a>, Lil Nas X, on “Old Town Road.”</p><p>And of course there were Village People, who performed “Y.M.C.A.” at the rally’s conclusion with Mr. Trump behind them, shimmying and occasionally singing along.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Did the song’s origin story matter? It did not. (Victor Willis, the group’s frontman and sole remaining original member, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/dec/05/ymca-has-never-been-gay-says-the-songs-lyricist-and-singer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made headlines last month</a> when he posted on social media that the song is “not really a gay anthem.”)</p><p>But of course this is how Mr. Trump views music: as theme songs, fight songs, soundtracks for memories more than works of art. He leans toward anthems rinsed clean of meaning, so long as they’re memorably durable. He walked onstage to Lee Greenwood serenading him with “God Bless the U.S.A.,” as if accepting homecoming king coronation at the prom.</p><p>The pre-rally soundtrack, apart from the occasional contemporary intruder — Bruno Mars’s “Versace on the Floor,” The Weeknd’s “Starboy” — skewed four to five decades old. It was largely the sound of Studio 54 and its offshoots, wrung through layers of history and irony and post-history until nothing is left but the beat.</p><p>Most of the speakers were introduced with flickers of hard-rock guitar, as if to reassure (and energize) the majority white crowd. But the messages they delivered were in places more nuanced. Dana White, chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship, reminded the crowd of Mr. Trump’s success with nonwhite voters, as did Mr. Trump himself in his speech, keen to paint MAGA as a multiracial movement.</p><p>But the contradictions were never far from the surface. The Puerto Rican superstar Anuel AA <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px-WCWeDCsc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">embraced Mr. Trump</a>, saying that he was onstage to speak “on behalf of all the Spanish community” and describing the backlash he received for supporting Mr. Trump. Just minutes later Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser, decried President Biden’s border policy and Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News anchor, touted Facebook and McDonald’s doing away with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p><p>It was the ultimate in having it both ways — slyly embracing the spoils of American diversity while forcefully arguing against D.E.I. Using the optics and sonics of integration as a soft weapon against their own furthering. The purpose of the rally was intended to be clear, but the music suggested a far messier — and still unresolved — truth underneath.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Jon Caramanica is a pop music critic who hosts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/popcast-pop-music-podcast">“Popcast,”</a> The Times’s music podcast.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jon-caramanica">More about Jon Caramanica</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
