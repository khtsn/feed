him again.</p><p>A Yemeni former employee of the U.S. Embassy in his country, Mr. al-Hamdani had been arrested in 2021 by Houthi militants who had taken control of the capital, Sana. In the years that followed, little was known about his case or those of 10 other active or former Yemeni employees of the U.S. Embassy detained with him, except that they were being held for links to the United States.</p><p>Then in June, Mr. al-Hamdani reappeared in a most distressing way: In a <a href="https://x.com/Ahmdhashem2/status/1836912505639120949" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">propaganda video released by the Houthis</a>, he confessed to spying for the United States and Israel.</p><p>“Seeing Shaif in that blue prison jumpsuit, forced to confess under duress, it broke my heart,” said Adam Ereli, an American diplomat who worked with Mr. al-Hamdani at the embassy more than two decades ago.</p><p>The video was released in early June a few days after the Houthis — an Iran-backed militia that now controls most of northern Yemen — <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2024/09/12/un-calls-for-release-of-all-aid-workers-detained-by-yemens-houthis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a new series of arrests</a>. They rounded up at least 27 staff members of United Nations agencies or local and international humanitarian organizations. In the following weeks, dozens more Yemenis working for similar groups were detained.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That wave of arrests in June raised fears of a broader crackdown on those linked to international organizations and foreign missions in Yemen. Tensions between the Houthis and the West have heightened over the past year, as the Yemeni militants have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/world/middleeast/houthis-red-sea-yemen-israel.html" title="">attacked international shipping in the Red Sea</a> and the Gulf of Aden and fired missiles at Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>Nadwa al-Dawsari, a conflict analyst, said Houthi repression and detentions of U.N. and international staff had been going on for at least five years. But she suggested the newest round of arrests had a more focused goal: stifling local support for Western powers and institutions.</p><p>“Their targeting of U.N. staff is a deliberate tactic to extort concessions by using them as hostages,” Ms. al-Dawsari said. “The Houthis seek to control who works for U.N. and international organizations, installing their own people to gain complete control over international aid.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Houthi fighters outside the United Nations complex in Sana this summer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yahya Arhab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Yemen is home to one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than half of the population — about 18.2 million people — require some form of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N. This makes the work of local and international humanitarian aid organizations all the more critical.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/houthi-detentions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">condemned</a> the recent wave of arrests and accused the Houthis of trying to spread disinformation through televised forced and fake confessions about the roles of current and former Yemeni staff members of the U.S. Embassy.</p><p>“We’re extremely distressed to see our colleagues in this manner, all of whom, without exception, have done nothing disloyal to Yemen,” Tim Lenderking, the U.S. special envoy for Yemen, said in an interview. “These forced confessions are entirely trumped-up. It’s theater.”</p><p>The United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-leader-pledges-to-pursue-power-sharing-accord.html" title="">closed its embassy in Sana in 2015</a> after the Houthis forcefully took power in the capital and the ambassador now operates out of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.</p><p>It is not clear whether any charges have been brought against those detained recently. But the Houthis have accused Mr. al-Hamdani and the others arrested in 2021 of conspiring against the country and charged them with being part of an “American-Israeli spy cell.”</p><p>At least one person detained in June, Mohammed Naj Khamash, 55, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2576505/middle-east" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">died in Houthi custody</a> this past week, according to his family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Speaking <a href="https://www.saba.ye/en/news3340154.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly</a> after the release of the videotaped confessions, the Houthi leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, said that the members of the alleged spy network arrested in 2021 had “subversive” motives behind their humanitarian work.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Installing a billboard depicting Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a top Houthi leader, in March in Sana.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yahya Arhab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the Houthi video, Mr. al-Hamdani <a href="https://www.saba.ye/en/news3344475.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claims that he operated under the orders of Mr. Ereli</a>, the American diplomat.</p><p>“This video is false and horrific,” Mr. Ereli wrote on social media in June. “Yes, Shaif al-Hamdani worked for me at the U.S. Embassy in Sana. No, neither of us were spies,” he added. “We ran educational and cultural programs, with Yemeni government approval, to develop free and independent institutions.”</p><p>After the Houthis overran Sana in 2014, the internationally recognized government there was forced to flee to the southern city of Aden. A Saudi-led coalition then launched a yearslong military intervention to oust them, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/25/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-yemen-houthis-gaza.html" title="">failed</a>.

That, and a lack of news media coverage and global interest, has made the consequences of running afoul of the Houthis even more dire, the activist added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>At least half a dozen Yemenis who worked closely with or knew Mr. al-Hamdani described him as a loyal citizen who spent a career in service of his countrymen.

Human Rights Office</a> in Sana and seized documents, furniture and vehicles. Volker Türk, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, condemned the action as “a serious attack on the ability of the U.N. to perform its mandate.”</p><p>The United Nations confirmed several humanitarian workers detained in June had been referred for criminal prosecution by the Houthi authorities.</p><p>“The potential laying of ‘charges’ against our colleagues is unacceptable and further compounds the lengthy incommunicado detention they have already endured,” several U.N. agencies and international organizations <a href="https://osesgy.unmissions.org/principals-affected-united-nations-entities-and-international-non-governmental-organizations-renew" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a letter</a> dated Oct. 12.</p><p>A potentially more significant consequence of the crackdown is that it has prompted U.N. agencies and Western governments to reassess their engagement in Houthi-controlled areas.</p><p>“That’s posing some very serious questions for the U.N. and these N.G.O.s about whether they can continue to operate in Yemen, and if so, on what terms,” Mr. Lenderking said. “We want to help the people of Yemen, but the Houthis are making it more and more difficult to do so safely.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ismaeel Naar is an international reporter for The Times, covering the Gulf states.
