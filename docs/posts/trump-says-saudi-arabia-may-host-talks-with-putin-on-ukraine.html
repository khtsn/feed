It also enables him to position himself as a key intermediary capable of bringing powerful nations to the table, despite his continuing struggles to end <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/10/world/middleeast/yemen-peace-talks.html" title="">Saudi Arabia’s involvement</a> in the devastating war in Yemen.</p><p>In September 2022, Prince Mohammed helped to broker the release of 10 prisoners from various countries as part of a broader exchange process between Russia and Ukraine. Later, in May 2023, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/world/europe/zelensky-arab-league-saudi-arabia.html" title="">invited Ukraine’s president</a>, Volodymyr Zelensky, to speak at a gathering of Arab leaders in the Saudi city of Jeddah, where Mr. Zelensky called on Middle Eastern nations to support Ukraine against Russia.</p><p>Later that summer, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine jointly hosted closed-door talks in Jeddah aimed at ending the war, attended by diplomats from over 40 countries, though not from Russia.</p><p>In August 2024, Saudi Arabia played an influential role in negotiating the biggest U.S.-Russian prisoner swap since the Cold War, and Mr. Putin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-thanks-saudi-arabias-mbs-helping-major-us-russia-prisoner-swap-2024-09-06/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personally thanked</a> the crown prince.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said that Prince Mohammed had played an “instrumental” role in mediating the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/marc-fogel-teacher-released-russia.html" title="">release of Marc Fogel</a>, an American teacher who was arrested on charges of bringing medical marijuana into Russia in August 2021.</p><p>“He has a very strong friendship with President Trump, and behind the scenes he was encouraging and pushing and looking for the right result, and it was helpful, it really was,” <a href="https://youtu.be/5ZPO9kTyl1A?t=310" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Witkoff said</a> of the Saudi crown prince’s role.</p><p>Like many countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has made it clear that it does not seek to take sides in the war. It has <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2577622/saudi-arabia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent humanitarian aid</a> to Ukraine even while cultivating close ties with Russia.</p><p>The Trump administration is also looking to the resource-rich Gulf nations, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to play a postwar role in Gaza. Mr. Trump has been pushing a proposal to transfer all two million Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and then rebuild the enclave as the “Riviera of the Middle East.”</p><p>Earlier this week, King Abdullah of Jordan said that there would be a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-egypt-jordan.html" title="">meeting in Riyadh</a>, the Saudi capital, involving Prince Mohammed and others to discuss Mr. Trump’s Gaza proposal before Arab leaders meet for an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on Feb. 27.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ismaeel Naar is an international reporter for The Times, covering the Gulf states.
