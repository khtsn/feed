That disease killed nearly 600,000 people in Africa in 2022 — 95 percent of deaths from malaria worldwide — according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240086173" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>. The Gates Foundation is supporting similar programs in the East African nations of Djibouti and Uganda.</p><p>“Every Burkinabe citizen would like to see this plague gone,” Souleymane Sankara, an entomologist with Target Malaria, said on a recent morning in a laboratory in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso’s second-largest city. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The Target Malaria researchers released their first swarm of genetically modified mosquitoes in 2019 in Bana, a village of 1,000 inhabitants in western Burkina Faso.

But a recent visit by New York Times reporters to the village suggested otherwise.</p><p>The village elders said they had read and signed a contract to permit the experiment. They said that they had not noticed any surge of dengue fever cases.</p><p>Bana’s imam, Seydou Sanogo, said that cases of malaria had actually decreased since the study started, perhaps since villagers learned from the researchers how to cover toilet lids and properly get rid of wastewater to reduce mosquito breeding grounds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“They made us part of the project since the beginning and clearly explained their goals,” Mr. Sanogo said about Target Malaria. “When we have questions or concerns, we raise them.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the notion has spread in Burkina Faso that researchers like Mr. Sankara and his colleagues are co-conspirators, indoctrinated by Mr. Gates to spread a deadly disease to their countrymen. Late last year and throughout the spring, <a href="https://x.com/LeaderRick23/status/1716567202109718740?t=tH5aGuM4aJjWbz3zGjwE_w&amp;s=19" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media users</a> accused Mr. Gates of seeking to use scientific research as a cover for population control in Africa.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Retrieving well water in Bana, Burkina Faso.

But he called Russia’s policy in Africa “a very beautiful thing” and added that African countries “should stop all cooperation with the West.”</p><p>Russia isn’t the only country seeking to influence public opinion in Africa. The United States and some European countries have a long tradition of similar operations, both official and covert, <a href="https://theconversation.com/white-malice-how-the-cia-strangled-african-independence-at-birth-176597" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">historians</a> have shown.</p><p>The reception of Western health care initiatives in Africa is also fraught because colonial powers once imposed medical campaigns against sleeping sickness, syphilis and other diseases, eroding trust, <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/medicine-empires-and-ethics-colonial-africa/2016-07" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/emontero/files/lowes_montero_colonialmedicine.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies</a>.
