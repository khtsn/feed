But, he said, “That is not what the research shows.”</p><p>That realization set Dr. Lee on a moral mission to review Ms. Letby’s case. Working pro bono, he gathered 14 specialists from around the world to assess the clinical evidence. Last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/europe/lucy-letby-nurse-uk-appeal-evidence.html" title="">he revealed their explosive findings</a> — that “there was no medical evidence to support malfeasance causing death or injury” in any of the babies that Ms. Letby was charged with harming.</p><p>“If there’s no malfeasance, there’s no murder. If there’s no murder, there’s no murderer,” Dr. Lee said, adding, “And if there’s no murderer, what is she doing in prison?”</p><p>Ms. Letby has exhausted her avenues to appeal in the courts. Her only hope now lies with a small, independent body, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is responsible for investigating possible miscarriages of justice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-719e2d7b">‘I didn’t know whether she was innocent or guilty’</h2><p>Dr. Lee, who retired in 2021 to a farm in rural Alberta, knew almost nothing about Ms. Letby’s case until an email landed in his inbox in October 2023.</p><p>Ms. Letby had always maintained her innocence, and her lawyer wanted Dr. Lee to review the medical evidence. “I thought it was spam at first, because how often do you get an email like that?” Dr. Lee said. After a second email, he realized the request was real.</p><p>Dr. Lee had spent his entire career focused on the youngest patients. After completing medical school in his native Singapore, he moved to Canada and trained in pediatrics before undertaking a neonatal fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital and later a Ph.D. in health policy at Harvard.</p><p>In 1995, he <a href="https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/45984.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created</a> the Canadian Neonatal Network, connecting specialists from across the country to improve outcomes for newborns. He became <a href="https://secure.supportsinai.ca/site/SPageNavigator/Sinai100/profile_lee.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pediatrician-in-chief</a> at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, and in 2019, he <a href="https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/recipients/146-3349" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received</a> the Order of Canada for introducing best practices that reduced infant mortality.</p><p>As he studied Lucy Letby’s trial transcripts, Dr. Lee immediately knew his research had been misinterpreted. “I didn’t know whether she was innocent or guilty,” he recalls. “But regardless of whether you’re innocent or guilty, you cannot be convicted on wrong evidence. That’s just wrong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He agreed to help with Ms. Letby’s request for an appeal, writing to England’s Court of Appeal and later providing live video testimony. But the court ultimately denied her request, saying Dr. Lee’s testimony should have been introduced at trial.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A prison van believed to be carrying the convicted hospital nurse Lucy Letby leaves Manchester Crown Court in 2023.

If their assessments differed, a third expert was brought in. The process was painstaking and took four months. But the final results were clear, Dr. Lee said. “In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care,” he told the news conference last month.</p><p>In the case of one baby, for instance, the prosecution argued at trial that she had been stable and had died from an injection of air into her IV line, causing an embolism. But the independent review found, based on her medical records, that she had died of sepsis and pneumonia, and that the mother, who went into labor prematurely, had not been given antibiotics to prevent infection.</p><p>In another case, a baby born at 25 weeks was intubated using the wrong size of endotracheal tube. While the prosecution alleged that Ms. Letby attempted to murder the infant by dislodging the tube, the experts found the baby’s condition deteriorated because of injury caused by intubation with a tube that was too large, and because a doctor did not understand “the basics of resuscitation, air leak, mechanical ventilation, and how equipment that were commonly used in the unit work.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, England.

In the months since, dozens of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/europe/lucy-letby-uk-trial-questions.html" title="">experts in medicine and statistics</a> have voiced concerns about the evidence.</p><p>Dr. Dewi Evans, the prosecution’s lead expert witness, did not respond to requests for comment, but he has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/06/lucy-letby-experts-review-dr-shoo-lee-chester-dewi-evans/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly criticized</a> the panel’s work and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/20/my-kind-of-case-intense-focus-falls-on-lucy-letby-trial-expert-witness" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he stands by his testimony.</a></p><p>The Countess of Chester Hospital, where the deaths took place, said it was focused on an ongoing police investigation and on a public inquiry that was set up by the government last year to investigate how a serial killer could get away with such crimes for so long. Earlier this week, the hospital’s former managers requested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/europe/lucy-letby-inquiry-thirlwall.html" title="">a halt</a> to that inquiry, in the wake of Dr. Lee’s review, but the judge refused, saying that the inquiry was never focused on examining Ms. Letby’s guilt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Lee, seated at right, presenting the findings of his expert panel in London in February.
