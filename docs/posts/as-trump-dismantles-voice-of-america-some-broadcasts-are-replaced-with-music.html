Employees said they quickly lost access to their work email and other communications programs.</p><p>Much of Voice of America’s content is produced in Washington and then transmitted to a network of affiliates worldwide. With most of Voice of America’s work force locked out, at least some of its radio frequencies in Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere went dark or began airing nothing but music, employees said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In other cases, radio, television and digital outlets that used Voice of America programming will remain online but without contributions from the United States. Some of those affiliates also carry content provided by state media from countries like Russia and China, which Voice of America’s programming had, in effect, countered.</p><p>“They have pulled the plug operationally,” said David Z. Seide, a lawyer at the Government Accountability Project who defends federal whistle-blowers and who represents some Voice of America journalists.</p><p>Mr. Seide said he was considering legal challenges aimed at reinstating Voice of America journalists. The American Foreign Service Association, whose ranks include Voice of America employees, <a href="https://afsa.org/afsa-statement-dismantling-us-agency-global-media" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it</a> “will mount a vigorous defense” of those employees.</p><p>The Trump administration’s efforts to shut down Voice of America are part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/magazine/nyt-sullivan-defamation-press-freedom-ruling.html" title="">a broader campaign</a> to weaken the news media. The White House, for example, has barred The Associated Press from covering certain events over its refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mr. Trump and his allies have sued news outlets, and his allies have said they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/business/media/trump-media-lawsuits.html" title="">eyeing more</a> litigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Voice of America began broadcasting in 1942, part of a federal effort during World War II to combat Nazi propaganda in Latin America and elsewhere. During the Cold War, its shortwave radio broadcasts behind the Iron Curtain were part of the U.S. government’s campaign to counter communism and foster freedom. At least until this weekend, Voice of America transmitted reports in dozens of languages and reached hundreds of millions of listeners outside the United States, including in countries like China and Iran, whose governments impose strict controls on outside news sources.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A 2002 taping of a news broadcast by the Farsi service of Voice of America.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Hosefros/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Voice of America’s charter was designed to protect its editorial independence from whichever administration is in power. Its <a href="https://www.insidevoa.com/p/5831.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mandate</a> is to serve as a reliable source of news, to present “a balanced and comprehensive” portrait of America, and to “present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively.”</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s first term, the White House repeatedly railed against what it saw as Voice of America’s liberal bias. The administration’s efforts to align the taxpayer-financed broadcaster with Mr. Trump’s agenda, including by conducting internal investigations of some of its journalists, were later deemed improper by federal investigators.</p><p>This year, Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/media/voice-of-america-trump.html" title="">moved swiftly</a> to quiet the broadcaster. He tapped a right-wing former TV news anchor, Kari Lake, to run Voice of America. Even before she arrived, the broadcaster began discouraging its journalists from saying or writing things that could be construed as critical of Mr. Trump — part of an attempt that its leaders hoped would help fend off attacks by the president.</p><p>The White House on Saturday issued a news release denouncing what it said was the broadcaster’s role in spreading “radical propaganda” and accusing its employees of entrenched left-wing bias. It is the same critique that Mr. Trump and his allies routinely make about the traditional media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Steven Herman, a longtime Voice of America correspondent, was put on an extended “excused absence” this month, pending a human-resources investigation into his social media posts about the Trump administration. On Saturday, he published what he described as a “<a href="https://www.steveherman.press/p/requiem-for-the-voice-that-carried?r=1g77q&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">requiem</a>” for the broadcaster.</p><p>“To ​effectively shutter the Voice of America is to dim a beacon that burned bright during some of the darkest hours since 1942,” Mr. Herman wrote.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>March 16, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of David Seide, a lawyer at the Government Accountability Project.
