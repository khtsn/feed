So when the director Jon M. Chu asked him to design the costumes for Universal’s long-awaited film adaptation of the Broadway musical “Wicked,” there was little learning curve to speak of.</p><p>A prequel of sorts to “The Wizard of Oz,” “Wicked” centers on two reluctant roommates at Shiz University: Galinda, an effervescent daughter of privilege who goes on to drop a vowel (that first “a”), and Elphaba, a green-skinned outcast who goes on to pick up a title (the Wicked Witch of the West).</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div

“Hamilton,” was already off to the races on his own preparations, collecting images of mushroom caps and bisected seashells for inspiration.</p><p>For all his familiarity with the extended Ozian universe, including Susan Hilferty’s Tony-winning costumes for the Broadway production, Mr. Tazewell said it was clear from his conversations with Mr. Chu that there was little appetite to recreate any previous vision of Oz.</p><p>“It was important for Jon to reimagine what this world was going to be,” he said.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Tazewell sat down to go over sketches, swatches and fungus photos for three pivotal costumes from “Wicked: Part I.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><h2 id="link-76240ac1">Glinda’s Bubble Dress: Orbs and Corkscrews</h2></p></div><div

floats into place somewhere among flying carpets, pumpkin carriages and tricked-out DeLoreans.</p><p>The bubble in the “Wicked” movie is a substantial update on the 1939 model from “The Wizard of Oz” — for starters, the soapy force field is activated by a foot pedal — but as a set piece, it’s difficult to ignore. So when designing the dress that Glinda wears to make her wafting entrance into Munchkinland, Mr. Tazewell had two major design motifs in mind: bubbles, obviously, but also spirals.</p><p>“The Fibonacci spiral was a big draw,” he said, referring to a mathematical form found throughout the natural world, from the whorl of a snail shell to the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/sunflowers-show-complex-fibonacci-sequences" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">configuration of seeds on a sunflower head</a>. The shape’s associations with what Mr. Tazewell described as “life creation” and other mysteries of the universe added a dash of thematic relevance.</p><p>“That felt very magical for me,” he said.</p><p>Recreated in carefully sculpted folds of nylon crinoline, the spirals gave structure and complexity to the more traditional fairy princess silhouette of Billie Burke’s Glinda costume in “The Wizard of Oz.” Each nylon cone was sandwiched between layers of lighter, more buoyant silk organza that had been printed with bubbles which were themselves embellished with foil, creating a sense of iridescence. Sequins, beads and paillettes completed the effect.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The film’s costume department estimates that 20,000 beads were used on the bodice alone.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lara Cornell/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bubbles printed on the skirt were enhanced with iridescent foil to create dimensionality and lend some extra shimmer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lara Cornell/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>On Broadway, the character of Glinda is already strongly associated with the color pink. Indeed, a sort of pink-versus-green binary has been the show’s visual calling card since it opened more than 20 years ago. But in key moments onstage, including the character’s bubble arrival (in a petal-like gown in baby blue) and her visit to the Emerald City (in a canary yellow dress), she diverges from her signature color. For the movie, Mr. Tazewell doubled down on pink.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>As an identifying palette for Glinda, he said, the color “runs all the way through her wardrobe, and even into the second film” — Mr. Chu broke the story into two parts, with the second expected to be released next fall — charting her path from spoiled ingénue to the Wizard’s under secretary of sugarcoating.</p><p>Was Mr. Tazewell worried about the possibility of audience hangover from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/style/all-pinked-out.html" title="">last year’s glut of “Barbie” pink</a>?</p><p>In a word, no. When trying to figure out how best to represent a character, he said, “I’m not really thinking about marketing.”</p><h2 id="link-1dcbef31">Elphaba’s Emerald City Look: ‘Dark Iridescence’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elphaba in the Wizard’s inner sanctum.

What looks solid black is actually three different fabrics: black silk chiffon on top of black lace on top of purple taffeta.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elphaba’s final silhouette is strongly influenced by an image of a witch innovated by the MGM costume designer Adrian some 85 years ago.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lara Cornell/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Tazewell found inspiration for the upper layer of the dress in the underside of mushrooms.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lara Cornell/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Why the secret purple? “It’s really just to give it more life,” Mr. Tazewell said. The “dark iridescence” of the taffeta, even beneath two other fabrics, helps the garment avoid reading as just a flat black dress. (Mr. Tazewell worked closely with the film’s director of photography, Alice Brooks, to make sure Elphaba’s costuming details weren’t swallowed up in darkness.)</p><p>The wavelike effect on the surface — inspired by the underside of mushroom caps, he explained — was created by manipulating the micropleated chiffon into an irregular swirl pattern atop a stabilizing gauze. The silhouette itself was considerably more traditional, taking cues from Victorian-era clothing and — what else — Margaret Hamilton’s Wicked Witch of the West costume from “The Wizard of Oz.”</p><p>In 1939, the influential Hollywood costume designer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/17/arts/design-review-adrian-whose-elegant-styles-were-movie-scene-stealers.html" title="">Adrian</a> almost single-handedly defined Western conceptions of what a witch looks like with his designs for Ms. Hamilton. Now, any designer trying to costume a witch has to reckon with Ms. Hamilton’s long, pointy-hatted shadow.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Ultimately, the Emerald City costume is a significant nod to Adrian’s image of a witch, but Mr. Tazewell’s textural innovations make the costume very much his own design. After coming up with the design, it was just a matter of fittings.</p><p>The thing about designing for clothing lovers like Ms. Grande and Ms. Erivo, he said, is that “they understand very well what looks good on them.”</p><h2 id="link-237617ce">Morrible’s Academic Robes: Gesturing at Magic</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Madame Morrible, a magical headmistress, welcoming students to Shiz University.

To establish her as a magical professor, Mr. Tazewell looked to classic academic robes for inspiration. In a riff on the colored hoods that scholars use to indicate their academic disciplines and degrees, Morrible wears a stole screen printed with a series of vaguely astrological-looking runes over a robe of amber-colored silk panne velvet. (Did the symbols mean anything? “They were made up,” Mr. Tazewell said.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-23"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The mysterious runes on the stole were created to suggest the idea of a professor of sorcery. “It looks magical,” Mr. Tazewell explained, “but it doesn’t say something.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lara Cornell/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Beneath Morrible’s academic robe: embroidered silk shantung, silk satin organza and cutwork leather.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lara Cornell/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Beneath, a silk shantung “under robe” is accessorized with a broad, cutwork leather belt with a metal clasp effect.
