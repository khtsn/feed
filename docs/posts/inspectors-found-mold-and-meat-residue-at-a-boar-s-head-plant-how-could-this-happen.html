How Could This Happen?</a></h2></div><p>“How could this happen?” is a natural question to ask after hearing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/listeria-outbreak-boars-head-deli-meat.html" title="">that nine people are dead and dozens have fallen ill</a> from eating deli meats tainted with listeria, a hardy, deadly bacterium that can survive refrigeration and freezing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/details-delimeats-7-24.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that</a> this is certainly an undercount.</p><p>But amid the tragedy, Americans should also pause to ask, “How does this not happen all the time?”</p><p>The sobering Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/documents/Non-Compliance_Reports_112022-To-812024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inspection reports</a> from a Boar’s Head plant in Jarratt, Va., make it clear that the failures are inexcusable. There are repeated citations for noncompliance with crucial rules like avoiding dripping or standing water (which can facilitate listeria growth). But the same inspection reports should also remind us of the extensive efforts — comprehensive regulations and diligent inspectors — to ensure that such failures are scandals rather than everyday events.</p><p>The U.S.D.A. inspectors duly noted that plastic or tarp was covering pipes — signs of a temporary fix to a leak. They noted small pieces of meat residue on food contact surfaces, even if those pieces were as small as one-fifths of an inch long. They noted pooled blood on the plant floor and rancid smells in coolers. They noted if any product was unlabeled. They noted “black moldlike substances” ranging from as small as a pinhead to the size of a quarter on walls. They noted when workers were on their phones while operating equipment. And so on.</p><p>It’s easy for companies to complain about excessive regulation, but consumers shouldn’t forget how hard it is to keep mass-produced food safe. Your food is kept safe quietly, day after day, because of extensive regulations born of experience and science. Eagle-eyed inspectors who notice even the tiniest bit of misplaced raw meat can save lives.</p><p>As this tragic listeria outbreak reminds us, regulations don’t work without accountability. When companies shirk their responsibilities, swift consequences should kick in, before someone dies or falls ill. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bugs-mold-mildew-inspection-boars-head-plant-listeria/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reports by the U.S.D.A. so far</a> show there were no enforcement actions against Boar’s Head in the past year, despite these reports. It is unclear what penalties, if any, the company will face. Whatever they are, one can only hope they will deter other failures.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzZiMzYyYmFhLTk2NzQtNTdjZi05NThiLWU3MWQ1ZTEzZmE1Yw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#harris-walz-interview" data-source-id="100000009665854"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bret-stephens"><img alt="Bret Stephens" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/insider/bretstephens/bretstephens-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-30T03:10:15.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 29, 2024, 11:10 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bret-stephens" itemprop="name">Bret Stephens</a></p><p>Opinion Columnist</p></div></div></div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/opinion/harris-walz-interview.html#commentsContainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Read 1143 comments" data-testid="comments-new-window-button"><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span>1.1k</span></p></div></a></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzZiMzYyYmFhLTk2NzQtNTdjZi05NThiLWU3MWQ1ZTEzZmE1Yw=="><a href="#harris-walz-interview">A Vague, Vacuous TV Interview Didn’t Help Kamala Harris</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Kamala Harris didn’t hurt herself in her interview this week with CNN’s Dana Bash. She didn’t particularly help herself, either.</p><p>On the positive side, she came across as warm, relatable and — to recall Barack Obama’s famous 2008 exchange with Hillary Clinton — more than “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3DeCLPwxXI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">likable enough</a>.” Harris refused to be baited into the identity-politics trap, emphasizing that she was running for president “for all Americans, regardless of race and gender.” And she had a nice line of attack against Donald Trump, observing the distinction between leaders who measure their strength according to whom they “beat down,” as opposed to those who measure it based on whom “you lift up.”</p><p>Less positive: She was vague to the point of vacuous. She struggled to give straight answers to her shifting positions on fracking and border security other than to say, “My values have not changed.” Fine, but she evaded the question of why it took the Biden administration more than three years to gain better control of the border, which it ultimately did through an executive order that could have been in place years earlier. It also didn’t answer the question of why she reversed her former policy positions — or whether she has higher values other than political expediency.</p><p>Harris also relied on a few talking points that may not serve her well in the next two months. She mentioned price gouging, but Americans probably won’t believe that grocery chains with razor-thin profit margins are the real culprits when it comes to their rising food bills. Her $100 billion plan to give first-time home buyers $25,000 in down payment support would mainly be an incentive for ever-higher home prices. Even Trump may be smart enough to explain just how inflationary the gimmick could be.</p><p>A bigger weakness in the interview was the presence of Harris’s running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Though he delivered a fine speech at the Democratic National Convention (brightly enhanced by his cheering son, Gus), he was transparently evasive in answering Bash’s questions about his misstatement about his military service, false claims about a D.U.I. arrest and misleading statements about his family’s fertility treatments. If there are other lies or untruths in Walz’s record, the campaign ought to get ahead of them now.</p><p>As for Bash, she is an intelligent and insistent reporter who isn’t afraid to ask follow-up questions when she gets flighty answers. But there was too much fluff in this interview to lay to rest doubts about Harris’s readiness for the highest office. Tougher questions next time, please.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="20" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad0"><div id="ad-0" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid1">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U2ZTI5OTYxLTU2YWUtNTljMS1hOWQ0LTA2ZmI1ZDdkYjIyYg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#harris-first-interview" data-source-id="100000009665853"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-30T02:28:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 29, 2024, 10:28 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle" itemprop="name">Michelle Cottle</a></p><p>Opinion Writer</p></div></div></div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/opinion/harris-first-interview.html#commentsContainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Read 344 comments" data-testid="comments-new-window-button"><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span>344</span></p></div></a></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U2ZTI5OTYxLTU2YWUtNTljMS1hOWQ0LTA2ZmI1ZDdkYjIyYg=="><a href="#harris-first-interview">Kamala Harris’s TV Interview Was a Solid First Effort</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Damon Winter/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>I think that went pretty well, don’t you?</p><p>After all the hand-wringing about how Kamala Harris has been avoiding extended media interviews, the Democratic presidential nominee did a solid job tonight in her sit-down with CNN’s Dana Bash.</p><p>Did we get a deep dive into Harris’s policy positions? No, we did not. But that was not the point of this interview. This was about Harris introducing herself to Americans in her new role — and proving a few basic things to everyone.</p><p>Let’s zip through just a few of the things Harris needed to do — and how she did:</p><p>For starters, the vice president fielded awkward questions without ducking them and without getting flustered. This included multiple inquires about why, since 2019, her positions have changed on issues like fracking and border security.</p><p>Her response was that her values have not changed but her experience as vice president has given her a different perspective and made her appreciate the importance of achieving consensus. You may not like that answer, but she was confident and unapologetic in explaining herself.</p><p>The not-getting-flustered part was as important as the answers themselves. She absolutely needed to avoid giving any opening for the MAGA trolls — who are obsessed with machismo and performative toughness — to accuse her of being overly emotional or weak or easy to rattle. Amusingly, Bash looked more flustered than Harris did for most of the interview.</p><p>Moving right along: Harris needed to come across as serious and thoughtful and, well, presidential.</p><p>Mission accomplished. She consistently struck a tone that was reassuring and self-assured. She was serious and at times even a bit salty — as she was when contrasting the decency of President Biden with the utter indecency of Donald Trump. But she never seemed nasty or even super angry, which was also vital, since women simply cannot get away with that like men can. I’m sorry, but you know it’s true.</p><p>Bonus: She looked the part. Dignified. Put together. Confident. Steady. All the things.</p><p>Even as she projected strength and seriousness, Harris needed to give people a sense of her as a real person, to let them peek behind the curtain a bit. Her story about the morning that Biden called to tell her that he was stepping aside did this nicely. There were baby nieces and pancakes and bacon involved. What could be more American?</p><p>Does Harris still have questions to answer and concerns to allay? Yep. The self-defining is not yet done. But this felt like a good first effort.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA3Yzc0MjgwLTlmNjUtNWY3Yy1iMzkwLTg3NjFhNzk2OGNlZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#deepfake-pornography-women-assault" data-source-id="100000009664650"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/valerie-pavilonis"><img alt="Valerie Pavilonis" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-29T19:09:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 29, 2024, 3:09 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/valerie-pavilonis" itemprop="name">Valerie Pavilonis</a></p><p>Opinion Editorial Assistant</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA3Yzc0MjgwLTlmNjUtNWY3Yy1iMzkwLTg3NjFhNzk2OGNlZQ=="><a href="#deepfake-pornography-women-assault">Punish the Creators of Deepfakes, Not the Women in Them</a></h2></div><p>On Wednesday, South Korean authorities <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/anyone-can-be-a-victim-sprawling-ai-fake-nudes-crisis-hits-south-korea-eec02232?mod=hp_lead_pos6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">began an investigation</a> into a sprawling network of non-consensual, sexually explicit A.I. photos and videos of women and girls. “Deepfake videos may be dismissed as mere pranks,” said the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, at a cabinet meeting this week, “but they are clearly criminal acts that exploit technology under the shield of anonymity.”</p><p>Deepfakes aren’t just South Korea’s problem; incidents involving politicians, celebrities and ordinary women have been reported in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/deepfake-porn_uk_5bf2c126e4b0f32bd58ba316" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/23/opinion/deepfake-sex-videos.html" title="">the United States</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/01/british-female-politicians-targeted-by-fake-pornography" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Britain</a>. A <a href="https://www.securityhero.io/state-of-deepfakes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2023 study</a> by an online security company found that pornography makes up 98 percent of all deepfake videos — and that 99 percent of the people portrayed in those videos are women.</p><p>Advances in technology are frequently twisted from their original use and employed to humiliate women. I remember being enthused by online video as a 10-year-old, until I learned about revenge porn and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html" title="">rape videos</a>, which document, for all time, the abuse of women and girls. Spy cameras were first <a href="https://www.cia.gov/legacy/museum/artifact/minox-b-camera/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used by actual spies</a> (for better or worse); they then became tools to spy on women — <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/untouched-yet-ruined-toll-of-south-korea-spycam-epidemic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially South Korean women</a> — in public restrooms, hotels and changing rooms. (Between 2013 and 2018, 30,000 spy camera incidents <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57493020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were reported</a> in South Korea).</p><p>The new deepfake crisis is even more blatant. Apps and websites solely for “nudification,” in which a user uploads a clothed photo of someone in order to generate an undressed version, abound.<strong> </strong>And in the United States, many sexual deepfakes are often the work of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/technology/deepfake-ai-nudes-westfield-high-school.html" title="">teenage boys</a>, which complicates prosecution.</p><p>Some U.S. jurisdictions are taking action. A few weeks ago, San Francisco <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/deepfake-pornography-lawsuit-san-francisco.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> in state court seeking to take down 16 such websites, and similar bills <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/technology/deepfake-ai-nudes-high-school-laws.html" title="">have recently been signed into law</a> in Washington, South Dakota and Louisiana. But as with anything on the internet, regulation is like fighting a hydra: once you take down one site, more follow. As for South Korea, on Thursday, the government <a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/08/29/south-korea-deepfake-criminal-penalties-telegram/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed to increase</a> penalties on those found to have shared sexual deepfakes.</p><p>But Korean authorities, and authorities everywhere, should take care to avoid one common mistake: telling women to change their behavior, somehow, to make up for stagnant legal action.

Remember Franklin Roosevelt’s dog Fala? No? Well, it was a while ago. President Biden is a big dog lover, but his pets were exiled to Delaware after multiple biting episodes. Jill Biden brought in a cat to fill the void.</p><p>Kamala Harris has been photographed cuddling puppies, but if there’s going to be any Republican animal stories during the campaign this fall, chances are they’re going to be sort of unpleasant. Donald Trump doesn’t like animals — naturally, since they draw attention from him. And now he’s got a new supporter who’s famous for his run-ins with their corpses.</p><p>Yeah, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once allegedly chain-sawed the head off a dead whale on a beach, bungee-corded it to the roof of his car and drove it five hours to the family home. Some years ago, Kennedy’s daughter Kick Kennedy called the episode “the rankest thing on the planet.”</p><p>People, does that remind you of anything? Back when Mitt Romney was running against Barack Obama, his son once told the story about a family vacation in which Romney put Seamus, their pet Irish setter, in a roof crate for a 12-hour drive to Canada. Apparently, Seamus weathered the trip fine, but the presidential campaign in 2012 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/opinion/gail-collins-mitt-romney.html" title="">was very boring</a>. As a diversion, I decided to try to see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/opinion/collins-dogging-mitt-romney.html" title="">how many times</a> I could mention the story before Election Day. Diligent readers counted around 80 mentions.</p><p>How would you compare the whale incident with that? Does it make you miss Romney? Yes, he was boring, but we’ve certainly learned how much worse a candidate can be. Don’t forget: Kennedy also dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park. His explanation was that he’d found it on the side of a road and decided to take it home to refrigerate its meat. Then, upon realizing that he was late to a steakhouse dinner, he changed his mind and left the carcass in the park, creating a stir he called “amusing.”</p><p>Kennedy, you may remember, says he once suffered from memory issues <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html" title="">because of a dead worm</a> in his brain. He’s now supporting Trump for president, and Trump might even consider giving an administration job to his new pal.</p><p>No further comments seem necessary. Just remember that whale.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RhNTM1YjE3LTJmZjgtNTRjYi1hYTJjLThhMDZjYWY0ZjU0ZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#jack-smith-trump-election" data-source-id="100000009662437"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-french"><img alt="David French" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/10/opinion/david-french/david-french-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-28T20:49:40.033Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 28, 2024, 4:49 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-french" itemprop="name">David French</a></p><p>Opinion Columnist</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RhNTM1YjE3LTJmZjgtNTRjYi1hYTJjLThhMDZjYWY0ZjU0ZQ=="><a href="#jack-smith-trump-election">Jack Smith’s New Case Against Trump Is Much Stronger Than His Old One</a></h2></div><p>When thinking about including charges in an indictment, prosecutors can decide which claims to make by asking whether the charge is strong or weak. In other words, does the evidence clearly support the charge, or would they be stretching either the evidence or the legal theory to make the case?</p><p>But there’s another, related calculation, and that’s asking whether the claim is clean or complicated. By “clean,” I mean simple and direct. Is this a charge, regardless of the strength of evidence, that the jury will find easy to understand? Obviously, the best possible case to bring is one that’s both clean and strong: The statutes and evidence are straightforward. The case is relatively easy to make.</p><p>And that’s exactly how I’d describe the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/27/us/politics/trump-jan-6-indictment-jack-smith.html" title="">new Jack Smith indictment of Donald Trump</a>. I disagree strongly with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, but to the extent there is any silver lining in that dark constitutional cloud, it’s that for Smith, less is truly more.</p><p>Even absent the immunity ruling, Smith’s first indictment would have given Trump room to argue that he was doing nothing more than using the levers of government power to investigate election fraud, a classic function of the Department of Justice. His actions were corrupt and unprecedented, but their official nature gave him hope for a defense.</p><p>Trump’s fake electors scheme, by contrast, was a campaign function, not an exercise of presidential power.</p><p>In fact, during the oral argument in Trump v. United States, Amy Coney Barrett <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2023/23-939_f2qg.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elicited a series of representations from Trump’s counsel</a> that a number of claims in the original indictment involved Trump’s private conduct. For example, she asked if it was private conduct when “three private actors; two attorneys, including those mentioned above; and a political consultant helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding, and petitioner” — Trump — “and a co-conspirator attorney directed that effort.”</p><p>Trump’s attorney affirmed, “That’s private.”</p><p>Not only is that private; it’s among the strongest claims in the whole case. There was never a credible argument for fake electors. And by conspiring to submit fraudulent electoral votes, Trump’s conduct fits <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/file/1029066/download" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">squarely within precedent for federal offenses</a>.</p><p>If Trump wins the presidency again, the case will disappear. But if he loses, he’ll stand trial, and Smith has now brought a much better case against the former president.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="14" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad2"><div id="ad-2" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid3">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="13" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2VhZTE5ZjQ3LTY4ZTktNWQ2Zi1iNmNkLWRlZmM2N2U5ZjEzMA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#north-carolina-election-battleground" data-source-id="100000009662071"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/frank-bruni"><img alt="Frank Bruni" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/frank-bruni/frank-bruni-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-28T18:30:34.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 28, 2024, 2:30 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/frank-bruni" itemprop="name">Frank Bruni</a></p><p>Contributing Opinion Writer</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2VhZTE5ZjQ3LTY4ZTktNWQ2Zi1iNmNkLWRlZmM2N2U5ZjEzMA=="><a href="#north-carolina-election-battleground">Why Kamala Harris Might Just Win North Carolina</a></h2></div><p>When Vice President Kamala Harris started talking policy with <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/08/16/harris-raleigh-north-carolina-speech-economic-plan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a heavily promoted speech about voters’ top concern</a> — the economy — where do you suppose she did it?</p><p>My home state, North Carolina. And my governor, Roy Cooper, was the Democrat chosen to introduce her on the climactic final night of the party’s convention.</p><p>But then Donald Trump stages a rally in North Carolina seemingly every other week — often enough that I’m terrified he’ll build and start hanging out at some Tar Heel analogue of Mar-a-Lago. He’s fixated on this place.</p><p>For good reason. North Carolina has 16 Electoral College votes — the same as Georgia, one more than Michigan and only one fewer than Ohio. And they appear to be in play. On Tuesday, the Cook Political Report moved North Carolina <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/north-carolina-moves-toss-minnesota-and-new-hampshire-shift" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">into the tossup category</a>.</p><p>The state hasn’t voted Democratic in a presidential election since 2008, when Barack Obama won, but Joe Biden lost here in 2020 by only about 75,000 votes, or under 1.4 percentage points.</p><p>And 2024 is different. Political analysts here tell me that they’re struck by the burst of energy for the Harris campaign and its significant investment in the state, where, according to the Pew Research Center, about 23 percent of eligible voters are Black, in contrast to 14 percent nationally. They haven’t seen anything like it since 2008.</p><p>Additionally, Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., noted that in the Republican presidential primary here, Nikki Haley received hefty percentages of the votes in urban counties even though her campaign by then was a lost cause. That suggests a potent anti-Trump sentiment among moderate Republicans and independents.</p><p>There’s yet another distinctive dynamic this time around. The slate of Republican candidates for statewide office is MAGA fury through and through. Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, is a firebrand with a history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/opinion/north-carolina-governor-robinson.html" title="">misogynistic, homophobic, antisemitic and altogether deranged remarks</a>. Michele Morrow, the Republican nominee for superintendent of public instruction, has suggested that Cooper, Biden, Obama, Hillary Clinton and Anthony Fauci should <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/14/politics/kfile-gop-nominee-north-carolina-public-schools-michele-morrow-executing-democrats/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">be executed for treason</a> — and that Obama’s killing should be televised.</p><p>Asher Hildebrand, a fellow professor at Duke University’s School of Public Policy, said that while that extremism probably won’t “push too many voters to the polls for Harris, it very well might keep some Trump voters home.”</p><p>And in an election potentially decided by one measly percentage point, such disaffection absolutely could turn North Carolina blue.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNjZmJkMDI5LTY1NGYtNWRiNS1iYzVmLTMyYmZhZjQwOGM1ZQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#jack-smith-trump" data-source-id="100000009661918"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-28T15:28:10.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 28, 2024, 11:28 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman" itemprop="name">Jesse Wegman</a></p><p>Editorial Board Member</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzNjZmJkMDI5LTY1NGYtNWRiNS1iYzVmLTMyYmZhZjQwOGM1ZQ=="><a href="#jack-smith-trump">Even the Supreme Court Can’t Save Trump From Himself</a></h2></div><p>If you’re going to subject yourself to one of Donald Trump’s social media tirades, it’s generally best to do so with a strong drink close at hand. Every now and then, however, the former president’s all-caps screeds offer a useful road map to understanding the basics of whatever issue he’s raving about — as long as you flip everything he says right-side up.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump took to his <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/27/why-djt-trump-media-stock-dropping/74971874007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">failing website</a>, Truth Social, to rage against the special counsel Jack Smith’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/27/us/politics/trump-jan-6-indictment-jack-smith.html" title="">new and improved indictment</a> against him for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>“For them to do this after our Supreme Court Victory on Immunity and more, is shocking,” Trump wrote. The new indictment, he claimed, “has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY.”</p><p>Poor Trump. He was confident that after the Supreme Court — <em>his</em> Supreme Court — went rogue last month and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity.html" title="">immunized him from prosecution</a> for virtually all “official” acts, he was in the clear.</p><p>But the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/01/us/scotus-immunity.html" title="">bonkers decision</a> did leave a few doors open for criminal prosecutions of former presidents, and Smith has taken full advantage of them. His new indictment, while nine pages shorter than the original, retains all the same fraud, obstruction and conspiracy charges. It leaves out only the actions that the court’s majority ruled were unquestionably immune, such as Trump’s attempts to force the Justice Department to investigate nonexistent voter fraud in swing states. In this regard, it very conspicuously does not have “all the problems of the old indictment.”</p><p>Nor is it accurate to say, as Trump did, that “you’re not even allowed to bring cases literally right before an Election.” He was referring, presumably, to the Justice Department’s so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/us/trump-investigations-midterm-elections.html" title="">60-day rule</a>, which is not actually a rule but a general guideline that prohibits taking overt steps that could influence how people vote in an upcoming election.</p><p>This is a sensible caution in a rule-of-law society, but it doesn’t apply to existing cases that are already filed and under the control of the judicial branch, as Smith’s prosecution of Trump has been for more than a year.</p><p>In fact, this is only an issue because Trump, abetted by the right-wing majority of the Supreme Court, has appealed and delayed the proceedings at every step. The justices had multiple opportunities to fast-track Trump’s appeals as early as December. They rejected all of them with no explanation, waiting until the very last moment to issue a ruling with zero constitutional support.</p><p>Now Trump is acting as if it’s all so unfair — or “lawfare and weaponization,” as he put it. So flip that right-side up: He’s the person who chose to weaponize the law, and the presidency, no one else. If the rule of law means anything, it means that he will face accountability for his actions, sooner or later.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="11" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad3"><div id="ad-3" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid4">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBmODNlMzMwLWNjNTQtNWQwMy1hOTg0LTQ0NzJmMTA4OWY5Mg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#harris-walz-georgia-bus" data-source-id="100000009660986"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-28T09:08:19.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 28, 2024, 5:08 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle" itemprop="name">Michelle Cottle</a></p><p>Opinion Writer</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzBmODNlMzMwLWNjNTQtNWQwMy1hOTg0LTQ0NzJmMTA4OWY5Mg=="><a href="#harris-walz-georgia-bus">Kamala Harris and Tim Walz Are Road-Tripping Through Georgia.

So hot. So sticky. But this week strikes me as the perfect moment for the Democratic presidential ticket to take a quick bus tour around southern Georgia.</p><p>Hot off their multiday love fest in Chicago, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are making clear they intend to play hard for Georgia, a battleground state, and not just in the politically blue, population-rich metro area of Atlanta. With the presidential race promising to be tight and ugly, they are wisely venturing outside the party’s usual comfort zones and are sending a message similar to the one from their preconvention road trip around Pennsylvania: We will show up in every part of the state and fight for every vote.</p><p>It seems worth noting that southern Georgia has an abundance of Black voters, a demographic the Democratic Party was feeling very shaky about when President Biden was looking like the nominee — and is hoping to re-energize now that Harris is at the top of the ticket. But even before Biden stepped aside, the party was investing in the area. “The South Georgia region is a priority for the campaign,” a representative for the Harris team <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-tim-walz-georgia-convention-momentum-rcna168039" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NBC</a>. “We have nearly 50 full-time staff across seven offices in the area, including Valdosta. We have hosted more than 500 events in the region since May 31.”</p><p>Team Trump is not conceding any ground. Last week Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, headlined an event in Valdosta, a majority-Black city not too far from the Florida state line. (Although it was Vance’s cringey <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/23/jd-vance-georgia-donut-shop/74922663007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stop</a> at an <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/jd-vances-very-awkward-stop-at-georgia-donut-shop-goes-viral/ar-AA1pgyNu?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">area doughnut shop</a> that wound up being widely shared on social media.)</p><p>So far, Trump has a polling edge in the state. But his troubled history with Georgia, where he is widely believed to have cost Republicans a Senate seat or two in recent years, makes it tricky terrain. Also, he has struggled to let go of his feud with the state’s popular governor, Brian Kemp.

But it did little to quell the anger among many Israelis over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s resistance to a cease-fire deal that would bring home all the remaining hostages — dead and alive.</p><p>The details of the rescue were not immediately clear. The Israeli military spoke of a “complex military operation.” Unnamed senior Israeli officials told The Times that commandos were scouring Hamas tunnels when they came upon Farhan al-Qadi, 52, a member of Israel’s Bedouin minority who was working at a kibbutz when he was seized in the Hamas raid of Oct. 7. In either case, he was the eighth hostage to be freed by the military.</p><p>With the latest rescue, 108 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, including 13 whose deaths have been confirmed, according to Haaretz. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group that represents the families of the hostages, said that the rest cannot hope to be freed by military operations. “A deal is the only way to secure the return of the remaining 108 hostages — the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial,” it <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/08/27/israeli-hostage-rescued-gaza-updates/74962676007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p><p>A deal seemed tantalizingly close at the end of May, when President Biden reported progress toward a phased cease-fire that would lead to the liberation of all remaining hostages and end the grueling fight that has taken more than 40,000 Palestinian lives. But since then, both Netanyahu and Yahya Sinwar, the elusive Hamas leader in Gaza, have repeatedly put roadblocks in the way of an agreement, with Netanyahu insisting on the full destruction of Hamas and Sinwar saying he would accept only a permanent end to hostilities. Last week Secretary of State Antony Blinken, told reporters that a bridging proposal offered by Washington was probably the best — and possibly the last — opportunity for a deal. The last round of talks ended in Cairo on Sunday without one.</p><p>Netanyahu’s insistence on a decisive victory has placed him at odds not only with the hostages’ families but also with the Israeli military, which questions whether a total victory over Hamas is feasible and is concerned about a potential clash with Hezbollah. More broadly, polls have shown that a majority of Israelis support a cease-fire in exchange for the hostages.</p><p>Al-Qadi did not join the debate as he profusely thanked those responsible for his liberation. But in a meeting with the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, al-Qadi urged the government “to do everything to bring people home.”</p><p>“Twenty-four hours without sleep,” he said. “People are suffering, suffering you can’t imagine.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad4"><div id="ad-4" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid5">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzcyODZlOWNjLTZiYTQtNWQ5YS04OTY1LWI2NDU4ZDk5NjkyMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#tulsi-gabbard-trump-transition" data-source-id="100000009660454"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-27T18:45:43.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 27, 2024, 2:45 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle" itemprop="name">Michelle Cottle</a></p><p>Opinion Writer</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzcyODZlOWNjLTZiYTQtNWQ5YS04OTY1LWI2NDU4ZDk5NjkyMw=="><a href="#tulsi-gabbard-trump-transition">Tulsi Gabbard’s Trumpy Transition Is Now Complete</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Step back, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. You aren’t even the most interesting ex-Democrat-turned-MAGA-tool to endorse Donald Trump this month.</p><p>For my money, that would be Tulsi Gabbard, the former House member and 2020 contender to unseat President Trump.</p><p>Gabbard has been on quite the political journey. She never got much traction in her 2020 race. But she did win herself a small but intensely passionate following based heavily on her isolationist leanings — which, admittedly, are more electrifying than most, thanks to her penchant for making indulgent statements about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/tulsi-gabbard-syria/508367/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bloodthirsty strongmen</a> such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/07/politics/tulsi-gabbard-assad-chemical-weapons-blitzer-cnntv" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bashar al-Assad</a> and Vladimir Putin. Indeed, Gabbard’s soft-on-Russia musings have been at times so striking that Hillary Clinton publicly called her “a Russian asset,” prompting Gabbard to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-sues-hillary-clinton_n_5e285903c5b6779e9c2b5d34" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sue</a> Clinton for defamation. (Gabbard later <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/politics/tulsi-gabbard-clinton-lawsuit/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dropped</a> the suit.)</p><p>Gabbard <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/tulsi-gabbard-announces-leaving-democratic-party-rcna51659" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quit</a> the Democratic Party in 2022 and became an independent, saying it had fallen “under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness,” and promptly began making nice with the red team. She <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/04/the-gops-new-russia-friendly-campaign-trail-buddy-tulsi-gabbard-00065024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit the campaign trail</a> for Republican candidates in the midterms. She <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/tulsi-gabbard-cpac-ukraine-russia/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference</a>. Conveniently, she was already a hot guest on Fox News.</p><p>For this election, she has settled snugly into the MAGA fold — all the more so since Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee. Gabbard has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/trump-debate-tulsi-gabbard.html" title="">helping Trump with his debate prep</a>. During a primary debate in 2019, you may recall, Gabbard hit Harris hard from the left — successfully enough to leave a mark and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/politics/tulsi-gabbard-kamala-harris-debate/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tick off Harris</a>. Trump, who has been struggling to figure out how to deal with his new opponent, is clearly hoping some of Gabbard’s mojo rubs off on him.</p><p>Just in case anyone had any doubts as to her new allegiance, Gabbard <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?&amp;q=tulsi+gabbard+trump+National+Guard+Association+of+the+United+States&amp;qpvt=tulsi+gabbard+trump+National+Guard+Association+of+the+United+States&amp;mid=FC5D12150DECF98052EDFC5D12150DECF98052ED&amp;&amp;FORM=VRDGAR" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsed</a> Trump on Monday. They appeared together at a National Guard conference in Detroit, on the third anniversary of the bombing in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members. A National Guard veteran, Gabbard asserted that Trump “understands the grave responsibility that a president and commander in chief bears for every single one of our lives.”</p><p>The next day, Trump announced that Gabbard was joining his transition team, as is Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>Team Trump is presumably betting that bringing on former Democrats will send a signal that his campaign is the one with a big tent and mainstream appeal. But when we’re talking about characters as … colorful as Gabbard and Kennedy, I’m betting the signal to many voters is that Trump’s G.O.P. is the home of the politically strange.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzc0NzM1MmRlLWVmZTctNWQ0YS1hMDYzLTc4MDg1MzcxZWE5Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#pavel-durov-telegram-arrest" data-source-id="100000009659818"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zeynep-tufekci"><img alt="Zeynep Tufekci" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular/Tufekci-Zeynep-circular-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-27T16:05:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 27, 2024, 12:05 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zeynep-tufekci" itemprop="name">Zeynep Tufekci</a></p><p>Opinion Columnist</p></div></div></div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/pavel-durov-telegram-arrest.html#commentsContainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Read 112 comments" data-testid="comments-new-window-button"><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span>112</span></p></div></a></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzc0NzM1MmRlLWVmZTctNWQ0YS1hMDYzLTc4MDg1MzcxZWE5Mw=="><a href="#pavel-durov-telegram-arrest">‘Free Speech’ Should Not Shroud Criminal Activity</a></h2></div><p>The detention in France of Pavel Durov, the founder and chief executive of the messaging app Telegram, has sparked a loud outcry about free speech. Elon Musk has portrayed the arrest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/technology/pavel-durov-telegram-detained-france.html" title="">on his X account</a> as an ominous threat to free speech, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. referred to the app as an “encrypted, uncensored” platform and said “the need to protect free speech has never been more urgent.”</p><p>It’s a curious case, and the French government hasn’t helped matters by releasing information in dribs and drabs. While it is possible that there are free speech issues entangled here, some early details suggest the issue may be one of criminal activity.</p><p>On Monday, the French prosecutor said in a statement that Durov — who is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-2c8015c102cce23c23d55c6ca82641c5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a citizen</a> of France, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis and the United Arab Emirates — was being held for questioning in connection with an investigation into criminal activities on the app, including the trading of child sexual abuse material as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering. Notably, Telegram explicitly boasts that it has never disclosed user data to any government, ever.</p><p>Questions have long swirled around Telegram. Contrary to widespread belief, Telegram is not encrypted in any meaningful sense. That would be “end to end” encryption, so that even the company couldn’t read users’ messages. Telegram — and anyone it chooses — can read all group chats, and there is no way to fully encrypt them. Those very large groups are the main attraction of the platform.</p><p>Private chats on Telegram also lack end-to-end encryption by default. Here, though, users can undergo an onerous process to turn on end-to-end encryption, which then applies only to that conversation. Even the protection provided to private chats is murky: <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cryptography experts have long questioned</a> whether Telegram’s limited encryption actually meets security standards.</p><p>Durov was born in Russia, where Telegram is used widely. The Kremlin has Durov’s back: It <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/27/russia-warns-france-over-telegram-founder-pavel-durovs-detainment.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a statement that</a> unless more evidence is provided, Durov’s detention may be “a direct attempt to limit freedom of communication.” Russian antiwar activists <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-kremlin-has-entered-the-chat/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have long wondered</a> how the Kremlin seems to know so much about their activities on Telegram. (Good question.)</p><p>Free speech is an important value, but protecting it does not mean absolving anyone of responsibility for all criminal activity. Ironically, Telegram’s shortage of end-to-end encryption means the company is likely to be more liable simply because it <em>can</em> see the criminal activity happening on its platform. If, for example, Telegram did not cooperate with authorities at all after receiving legal warrants for information about criminal activities, that would mean trouble even in the United States, with its sweeping free speech protections.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="5" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad5"><div id="ad-5" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid6">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RlMzYxOWI3LWY4Y2QtNTZhNS1iNDdmLWE4NWI3YjA5OWU5Mw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#nasa-starliner-astronauts-space" data-source-id="100000009658807"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neel-v--patel"><img alt="Neel V.

What was supposed to be a weeklong mission to the International Space Station will now be an eight-month stay in space, after the spacecraft they launched aboard, the Boeing Starliner, experienced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/02/opinion/thepoint/yes-the-starliner-is-stuck-in-space?smid=url-share" title="">some unexpected glitches</a>.</p><p>Boeing has been utterly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/boeing-starliner-space-defense-business-nasa-8e5f6414629efcc0a78d43fb9c778333" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">humiliated</a> by the Starliner’s failure, not least because the company’s rival, SpaceX, will take Wilmore and Williams home. But it’s NASA that deserves applause: Faced with an unsettling turn of events for its human spaceflight program, the agency has gotten a couple of things right.</p><p>It got the first thing right nearly a decade ago. In September 2014, NASA awarded contracts to both SpaceX and Boeing for their commercial crew programs, effectively saying it would pay two companies to develop new spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts to and from the space station. The veteran aerospace firm Boeing was awarded $4.2 billion, while the newcomer SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion.</p><p>While both companies’ programs were mired in delays, SpaceX eventually vaulted ahead of Boeing and pulled off a successful crewed flight to space in 2020. Boeing remained sluggish. Throughout this period, NASA emphasized that the whole reason it gave contracts to two companies in the first place was in case one company hit snags. The wisdom of that choice is on full display now, as Wilmore and Williams can return home on a SpaceX mission, after the Boeing mission went awry. Redundancy paid off.</p><p>NASA got one other thing right during this debacle. Though Wilmore and Williams are trapped in space until February, the agency is wisely playing it safe. There isn’t much reason to think the Starliner couldn’t securely bring the astronauts back to Earth. But NASA is choosing not to risk a repeat of the tragic Challenger and Columbia disasters. Taking risks is a fundamental part of spaceflight, but the United States is no longer in a race to beat the Soviets. NASA can and should take its time to reduce the odds of risk whenever possible. It’s the right thing to do.</p><p>The astronauts’ delayed return must be truly aggravating for both of them and their families. But it’s unquestionably preferable to an alternative outcome that would put them both in any sort of elevated danger.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Y3YzE4YTkzLTNlMWItNWQzOC04NjEzLWE3ZjE0M2YyMGJhMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#gus-walz-cry-dnc" data-source-id="100000009656960"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul"><img alt="Pamela Paul" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/opinion/pamela-paul-new/pamela-paul-new-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-26T19:08:13.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 26, 2024, 3:08 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/pamela-paul" itemprop="name">Pamela Paul</a></p><p>Opinion Columnist</p></div></div></div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/opinion/gus-walz-cry-dnc.html#commentsContainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Read 1097 comments" data-testid="comments-new-window-button"><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span>1.1k</span></p></div></a></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Y3YzE4YTkzLTNlMWItNWQzOC04NjEzLWE3ZjE0M2YyMGJhMQ=="><a href="#gus-walz-cry-dnc">Gus Walz Brought Out Both the Joy and the Cruelty</a></h2></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Gus Walz’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/style/gus-walz-dnc-social-media.html" title="">unbridled emotional reaction</a> last week at the Democratic National Convention to the nomination of his father, Gov. Tim Walz, embodied both the humanity that lies beneath the political process and the momentousness of the political process itself.</p><p>In other words, Gus reacted the way he did because he recognized the import of his father’s nomination. And because the man onstage was his father — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBrnKM0jo40" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“That’s my dad!”</a> — a man who raised and <a href="https://people.com/gus-walz-learning-disorder-secret-power-exclusive-8691793" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported and accepted</a> and loved him for who he is, a 17-year-old boy with anxiety and a learning disorder and, as Tina Brown wrote in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/tim-walz-son-gus.html" title="">gorgeous essay</a> on Friday, a human being like any other.</p><p>Gus’s reaction was beautiful. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/democratic-convention-tim-walz-son-emotions-criticized-backlash" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">then things got ugly</a>.</p><p>In response to Gus’s exuberance, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ann-coulter-roast-goes-viral-as-internet-gets-revenge-for-gus-walz" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ann Coulter posted</a> on X, “Talk about weird …” (She later took her post down.) “Sorry, but this is embarrassing for both father and son,” the conservative radio host Jay Weber posted. “If the Walzs represent today’s American man, this country is screwed,” he said, adding a crude insult of the teenage Walz. (He, too, removed his post.)</p><p>Perhaps they didn’t know the context. They didn’t know anything about Gus Walz beyond the politics of his father. They didn’t realize they should have been kind. Few people do before issuing a least-charitable-interpretation potshot. People’s private lives, their psychological state, their family or personal circumstances and their disabilities are often invisible. This is as true for public figures as it is for private citizens. Gus didn’t deserve “special” treatment — he deserved the kind of treatment any person does.</p><p>If nothing else, Gus reminds us of what an unfiltered human reaction looks like and what a sharp contrast it makes with the noxious swill of performance, hot takes and low blows that passes for online political commentary.</p><p>Let’s dwell on that contrast for a moment. Gus’s surge of emotion offered an image of us at our all-too-human best. Those who chose to disparage him reeked of our all-too-human worst. Gus Walz showed us what it means to really care about other people. His critics made clear they’ve forgotten how.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="2" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-ad6"><div id="ad-6" data-testid="FeedItem"><div data-testid="StandardAd"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-dfp-ad-mid7">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM5N2VlNjE1LWY0OWUtNTE4YS05NzdlLTcxNjY1YmFhN2U3ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/opinion/thepoint#harris-trump-election-polls" data-source-id="100000009656959"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy"><img alt="Patrick Healy" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbStandard-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/21/opinion/patrick-healy/patrick-healy-thumbLarge-v3.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-08-26T09:03:36.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Aug. 26, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-healy" itemprop="name">Patrick Healy</a></p><p>Deputy Opinion Editor</p></div></div></div><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/harris-trump-election-polls.html#commentsContainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Read 365 comments" data-testid="comments-new-window-button"><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span>365</span></p></div></a></div></div><div><h2 id="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzM5N2VlNjE1LWY0OWUtNTE4YS05NzdlLTcxNjY1YmFhN2U3ZA=="><a href="#harris-trump-election-polls">Harris Has the Momentum. But Trump Has the Edge on What Matters Most.</a></h2></div><p><em>Every Monday morning on The Point, we kick off the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><p>We’ll know soon what kind of polling bounce Kamala Harris got out of her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/kamala-harris-speech.html" title="">very good convention</a> in Chicago. I’m especially curious how she’s faring in Pennsylvania and Georgia, which are the most critical battlegrounds in the race. Given Harris’s and the convention’s focus on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/tim-walz-small-town-conservatives.html" title="">themes</a> like patriotism, small-town values and the economy, I can see her gaining a couple of points in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Democrats’ hammering of Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/kamala-harris-speech.html" title="">on abortion</a> is also going to help Harris in Pennsylvania and Arizona, where abortion rights is a hot-button issue.</p><figure><figcaption><div><h3>The Democrats’ Joyfest is Over. Now Comes The Slugfest.</h3><p><span>Kamala Harris was flying high last week, but Donald Trump is poised to bring her back down to earth.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure><p>But consider this: Harris has won the vast majority of news cycles since she declared her candidacy. And yet, she is only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">two or three percentage points</a> ahead of Trump in the national polling average and effectively tied with him in the seven swing states that will decide the election. Structural factors — polarization, the gender gap, Republicans’ advantage in the Electoral College — are keeping this race tight.</p><p>To that end, with early voting only weeks away, the battle between Harris and Trump will be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/kamala-harris-democratic-convention.html" title="">to find the best strategies</a> for the three most important elements of this campaign.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Defining the race:</strong> Harris wants to make the race about the future, freedom and unity; Trump wants to make the race about the past, his presidency and threats to the country. Harris has effectively cast the race as a choice between her and Trump, which helps her because he is so unpopular. But there is still time for this to change, especially if an unexpected or outside event suddenly shifts voter attention to safety or national security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defining Harris:</strong> So far, Harris is also winning on this front, positioning herself as the candidate of change — an appealing image to many voters. Trump is trying to define her as “<a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/f71c6a76-44ae-4cd3-adc8-b775decdc52a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dangerously liberal</a>” and as the de facto incumbent, but even some Republican strategists tell me that they don’t see strong evidence this is catching on. Trump will campaign in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania later this week; watch for whether he starts trying to define her anew.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defining Trump:</strong> The former president is struggling. He is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/trump-abortion-truth-social.html" title="">trying to appeal</a> to moderate and independent voters by opposing a national abortion ban and talking about the economy; if he had the discipline to bear down on the cost of living, trade and immigration, he’d be doing better than he is in Pennsylvania, where those issues resonate. But as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik put it to me, the only way Trump can win the presidency is by turning out his vote strongly and edging out his opponent with sufficient numbers of swing voters — which is what he did successfully in 2016.</p></li></ul><p>Right now, Harris has the momentum, but I think the Electoral College <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">currently</a> <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/georgia/trump-vs-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">favors</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/25/us-news/james-carville-warns-kamala-harris-polls-arent-as-good-as-they-look/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/harris-battleground-state-tour.html" title="">Nothing will be more critical</a> than the Sept. 10 debate to define the race, Trump and Harris. A debate changes things in an instant. Just ask Joe Biden.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
