How do you feel right now, about the country and Democratic chances in November?</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Jason Isbell: </strong>I think the Democratic chances in November are good right now — and I think because of the fact that Kamala is prepared, and because of the fact that Biden actually did something selfless for the country, which was sort of shocking. I wouldn’t say unexpected, considering the kind of person that he seems to have always been, but it feels shocking when somebody actually does something patriotic now in a leadership role.</p><p>To set aside his own ego and pride and even just his work ethic and do what he did, it was a huge, huge moment. And it reinvigorated the party and the voting base but also made me sort of realize that we have an opportunity here to aim for something that’s not just mitigation.</p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: You’re kind of like a Democratic campaign’s dream voter: a Southern white man with a working-class upbringing, but there’s not a ton of people like you that are voting for Democrats. Why do you think that is?</p><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: I think it’s a cultural thing. After Carter, in the Reagan era, I think a lot of issues got conflated. And I think the goals and the intentions of the party were sort of obfuscated by the fact that there was this big PR campaign that sort of made religious morals tie in with a conservative political ideology. And I think that’s kind of where we went wrong, and where a lot of people in the South just started voting against their own interests. And a lot of people like me went along with what their family did, and what their churches did, and became the kind of people who would vote for conservatives no matter what.</p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: What do you think Democrats could do to bridge that gap, to appeal to more Southern white working-class men?</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: If the door is open, I mean, people care about the economy. If you can’t afford the things you need, it’s really difficult to go outside of your own house and off your own property and think about what’s going on with your neighbors. If the Democratic Party can keep their foot in the door long enough to actually show evidence of the fact that these plans will work best for everybody, then you get the opportunity to educate people on what the party’s all about. But first, you know, first you gotta, you gotta feed them. I mean, that’s, that’s rule No. 1, because you don’t get a lot of time to teach a hungry man something.</p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: I was at the R.N.C., and on the final night I saw the country music star Jason Aldean next to former President Trump. And I remember when Mr. Aldean’s “Try That in a Small Town” came out, you had a pretty strong reaction to it. Why?</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump greeted Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany, on Day 4 of the R.N.C.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brian Snyder/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: Well, I think it’s pandering to a part of us that I think is nihilist and sort of hopeless in a way. What they’re aiming for is to get this sort of, like, masculine pride out of the fact that they’re afraid of things that are different.</p><p>And I think that song sort of, to me, reinforces, or attempts to reinforce, the gap, the difference between small-town Americans and big-city Americans. And it also preys on some of those fears. </p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: Why do you think the right has been able to latch onto country music and Americana?</p><p><strong>Jason Isbell:</strong> The right has this idea of a sort of mythologized American past — you know, Make America Great Again kind of thing, which is extremely exclusive, because the farther back you go, the fewer people America was great for. And, yeah, it might have been better for them back then because they didn’t have to act right. Because here’s the thing, there’s something about country music and old-time music and even folk music, to a certain extent, that I feel like is supposed to come with a dose of self-awareness. </p><p>And I think the right misses that, or ignores that, and then they use these images and these pictures of times gone by that you hear from country music and from Appalachian music, and they use that to sort of forward that agenda of America used to be wonderful. And we can get back to that again, if we can just, just make all these folks shut up that don’t look like us.</p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: I was thinking about music as a form of protest, able to speak truth to power and inspire protest movements. Like from Woody Guthrie to the Clash. So I’m wondering, as music becomes more siloed, with streaming and siloed experiences, do you still think music can have that truth to power moment?</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: Oh yeah. </p><p>Because for me, the goal is to take the stigma of politics, the word politics, out and just try to show people this is actually how you’re living day to day. That’s what politics are. And if you’re able to ignore that or write about things that aren’t political, that just means that you’re privileged enough to not have to worry about things like clean water, where to send your kid to school, how to get back and forth to work, how to afford your groceries. So I think the more that line blurs between your personal life and your politics, the better off we are. And I think access to musical technology and the means of distribution are going to make that a much better thing.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President and Mrs. Carter chat with the singers Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter, during a visit the couple paid to the White House in 1977.

I think of your song “White Man’s World.” Do you think that reaches the people who need to hear it?</p><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: I think everybody needs to hear it. Because even if you’re preaching to the choir, sometimes the choir is not singing loud enough. </p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: You mentioned your audience earlier. I grew up with Springsteen and going to Bruce shows, and there are, I think, maybe more people in the audience who disagree with him politically than there are people in the audience who agree with his Democratic-leaning public positions.</p><p>Do you ever worry that playing at the D.N.C. or taking your public Democratic positions could change that in your audiences?</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: No, I don’t worry about that. I don’t really think mine is split down the middle. I think the majority of people, just because of the fact that the music I have always made has been independent and more of a boutique thing. If it grows, and it already has grown past the point I expected it to. But the people that we pick up along the way — usually the majority of those people — are at the very least open to whatever I have to say politically. But at the same time, like, the ultimate goal for me is not to get as many fans as possible. I have enough fans, and I have enough money, I have enough gear.</p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: You can always have more gear.</p><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: That’s true actually. But at a certain point, you have to think: What’s the ultimate goal of this? And how am I serving that? And for me, the ultimate goal is just to communicate my inner life and test the connection that I have with everybody else, with strangers. And in order to do that, you gotta tell the truth, and you gotta be honest about how you feel. And if it runs some people off — I’m going to tell you, this might not sound like the truth here, but it is — if it runs people off, I would like them to go. I don’t want people out there who are going to make it uncomfortable for the rest of my audience. And if you’re not open to hearing what I have to say, then you’re probably not going to be open to somebody standing by you who is different from you. And that’s not the kind of room I want to be in. I don’t care how big it is or how many tickets I’ve sold.</p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: But do you think that also leads to division?</p><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: Oh, there’s, there’s always been division. I mean, we could see it a little more clearly now, but yeah, I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the idea that we’re a divided nation now more than we’ve been in the past. Because I think people forget, less than 100 years into this experiment, we were killing each other. And there were bleachers. There were bleachers. You talk about, oh, I can’t believe we’re watching all this stuff go down on our phone. We had bleachers in the 1860s, and the rich people dressed up and sat in the bleachers and watched the poor people kill each other. So no, I don’t think we’re more polarized now than we’ve ever been. </p><p><strong>Nick Corasaniti</strong>: Years ago, someone asked you on Twitter, would you ever run for office? Do you ever think about that now?</p><p><strong>Jason Isbell</strong>: I think about it sometimes. But, you know, just getting to know some politicians over the last few years, you got to have a lot of patience. And I may have that kind of patience at some point, but at this point in my life, I don’t yet have it. I’m still working on that. I feel like I would, a few months in, I would just sort of lose my mind and start screaming into a microphone because that’s a tough job. And when somebody commits their life to it, and really risks all the different kinds of security that they might have with their family, and they do it for something other than just power, I think it’s a pretty beautiful move. </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
