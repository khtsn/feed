Wind gusts in some places <a href="https://www.weather.gov/wrh/TextProduct?product=afdeka" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceeded 90 miles per hour</a> — equivalent to the winds of a hurricane.</p><p>Amtrak canceled trains across the Pacific Northwest, and the storm slowed service on Bay Area Rapid Transit, the San Francisco region’s major transportation system. Gusty winds forced Northern California drivers off roadways, where they crashed into other vehicles and struck power poles.</p><p>A truck tipped over on U.S. 101 in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, and temporarily blocked traffic, according to the California Highway Patrol. And a large S.U.V. overturned on a highway near the Napa Valley winery town of Calistoga.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Before surging into California from the north, the storm felled trees that killed at least two people in Washington. A tree crashed through the roof of a home in Bellevue, on the outskirts of Seattle, killing a woman who lived there, officials said. Another woman died after a tree fell on a homeless encampment in Lynnwood, Wash.</p><p>The storm also dumped snow at higher elevations, and blizzard conditions were a possibility in the Cascade mountain range, as well as other parts of the Pacific Northwest. Snow forced the authorities to temporarily close Interstate 5 just south of the Oregon-California border for a stretch of more than 50 miles.</p><p>Electricity was still out for about 364,000 customers in Washington and California early Thursday, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utilities. Officials warned that some of the outages could last for days because of the extent of the damage.</p><p>The storm led to more than 60 flight cancellations and 450 delays at San Francisco International Airport on Wednesday, according to data from FlightAware, a flight tracking website. Delays there were averaging at least an hour late Wednesday.</p><p>Utilities in the Seattle area flew helicopters to locate damaged lines, and crews worked to clear trees and debris. The storm caused the most outages in almost two decades, said Jenn Strang, a spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, a local utility.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>California’s ski resorts are in for a bounty of snow. The Sierra Nevada peaks near Lake Tahoe could receive as much as five feet over the next week, said Matthew Chyba, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nev.: “Our first good snow, I’d say.”</p><p>The impact of an atmospheric river can be most extreme when it stretches on for several days, or is immediately followed by another, as has happened in recent winters. Heavy rainfall saturates the ground so much that hillsides and highways can be swept away.</p><p>Climate change can make storms of all types more intense, because warmer air can hold more moisture. When it comes to atmospheric rivers in particular, scientists are studying whether global warming may be affecting the number that sweep through California each year and how long they last, though they don’t have clear answers yet.</p><p>The atmospheric river drenching the region this week was also made more destructive by its connection to another storm system off the coasts of Oregon and Washington. Called a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/climate/bomb-cyclone.html" title="">bomb cyclone</a>” — a storm whose atmospheric pressure drops quickly over a short period — that system reached the lowest pressure reading ever recorded in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Soumya Karlamangla is a Times reporter who covers California.
