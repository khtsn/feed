                  <p>As a two-time Major winner, a Major MVP, and having contributed in bringing 18 trophies to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1532200550">fnatic</a>&#39;s cabinets and seven to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6667/faze" data-tooltip-id="uid285606899">FaZe</a>&#39;s, as well as being the Player of the Year in 2015 and a Top 20 Player of the Year on three more occasions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">Olof <span>&#34;⁠olofmeister⁠&#34;</span> Kajbjer</a> was bound for the hall. The only question was when that would happen.</p>
                  <p>The fact that he got voted in by the committee with the second class and is the first player in the hall to have made his name after 1.6 is a testament to the mark he left on the game as the pointman of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid451230935">fnatic</a> team during a golden era and as a global star with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6667/faze" data-tooltip-id="uid2046702524">FaZe</a>.</p>

I would play whatever I could play, if it was a public, a mix, whatever. I just wanted to play.&#34; And while the seeds of competition were being planted, the Swede was not yet fixated on taking the next step.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t really want to compete, and I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t want to compete, but I wanted to play these online tournaments against these good teams,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> says of that period, which stretched into the early days of CS:GO until <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5028/lgb" data-tooltip-id="uid217950282">LGB</a> came knocking in 2013 and provided the perfect opportunity to make the transition to a more serious team atmosphere without the need for full-time commitment.</p>

                    <p>olofmeister joined LGB in 2013 after a small push from a precocious article</p>
                  </div>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> proposed a small trial period, so he could also see if he could make it work with his studies at the time, and if he really was ready to commit to playing competitively. The team did well at a big qualifier, and he was asked to join the team formally, but it was an external force that made him take the plunge before he officially accepted the offer. &#34;The day after, there was news on Fragbite [saying] olofmeister is joining LGB,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> recalls, &#34;I was like, &#39;What?&#39; But I&#39;m thankful for that because I needed someone to push me, and I wanted to join.&#34;</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5028/lgb" data-tooltip-id="uid217950282">LGB</a> brings back fond memories because the childlike fun was still there, but it was serious enough that the team was starting to become competitive. &#34;We would practice if we could,&#34; he recalls, but with players working and studying, there wasn&#39;t a set regimen. That Swedish <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5028/lgb" data-tooltip-id="uid217950282">LGB</a> roster was also where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> got through the rookie jitters, as they became good enough to go compete at Majors and events of note, from ESWC and DreamHack Winter in 2013 to their biggest breakout event, EMS One Katowice 2014, where they reached the semi-finals.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I remember, first of all, being very nervous playing against all of these people I looked up to, like NIP, VP, the French guys…&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> says, to the point that he had a hard time sleeping before big matches, &#34;but at the same time thinking that I&#39;m going to beat them.&#34;</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>It was during that EMS One Katowice 2014 Major&#39;s grand final between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4411/ninjas-in-pyjamas" data-tooltip-id="uid105151559">Ninjas in Pyjamas</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5378/virtuspro" data-tooltip-id="uid1554752142">Virtus.pro</a> at the Spodek Arena that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> really felt Counter-Strike could become something. &#34;It was like, what is happening?&#34; he recalls. &#34;There are so many people here, and it&#39;s so freaking awesome. That was the first time I got shocked by how big it can be.&#34;</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a>&#39;s stock was rising just as Counter-Strike was booming, and two Swedish teams were in the thick of it. The legendary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4411/ninjas-in-pyjamas" data-tooltip-id="uid105151559">Ninjas in Pyjamas</a>, who had gone on an 87-0 winning streak in the early days of the game with Hall of Famers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/39/get-right" data-tooltip-id="uid2098989327">Christopher <span>&#34;⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠&#34;</span> Alesund</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/29/f0rest" data-tooltip-id="uid447813927">Patrik <span>&#34;⁠f0rest⁠&#34;</span> Lindberg</a> leading the way, and their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1147766632">fnatic</a> antagonists.</p>

                  <p>&#34;To be honest, I wanted to join NIP,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> admits. &#34;They were legendary, right? They had the 87-0 record, and most people wanted to join them. They were very likable guys, so I was trying to stall a bit with fnatic, but NIP kept saying, &#39;We&#39;ll do it, next event.&#39;&#34;</p>
                  <p>Tired of waiting, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> ended up picking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1472580405">fnatic</a>. &#34;I&#39;m very thankful for that,&#34; he says, &#34;it was the best decision of my career.&#34; The Swede hit the ground running with a top-four finish at Gfinity 3, a second-place to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4411/ninjas-in-pyjamas" data-tooltip-id="uid1336979575">Ninjas in Pyjamas</a> at the ESL One Cologne 2014 Major, where his legend grew when he made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sky3WydyiX8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">one of the most memorable plays</a> in Counter-Strike history by defusing the bomb surrounded by the flames of a molotov, which prompted Valve to commemorate the moment with an in-game graffiti, and finally earning his first career trophy at SLTV StarSeries X, where he beat his future teammate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2757/guardian" data-tooltip-id="uid137907825">Ladislav <span>&#34;⁠GuardiaN⁠&#34;</span> Kovács</a>&#39; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4608/natus-vincere" data-tooltip-id="uid981380830">Natus Vincere</a> in the grand final.</p>

                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> started winning with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1472580405">fnatic</a>, lifting three trophies in a row late in 2014 during the lead up to the DreamHack Winter 2014 Major. On top of that, the relationships with his teammates were good, and everything was looking up for the burgeoning star. Until the fateful Major, where a pixel walk made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1472580405">fnatic</a> the scene&#39;s scapegoats.</p>
                  <p>It was the quarter-finals against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4674/ldlc" data-tooltip-id="uid1605331699">LDLC</a>. The series was tied and went to the Overpass decider. The French team was ahead 13-3, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1472580405">fnatic</a> turned the map around using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqB95s47f1w" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">infamous boostmeister pixel walk boost.</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1472580405">fnatic</a>&#39;s victory was reverted, and the tournament organizer proposed a rematch, but the Swedes decided to forfeit the series, clearing the way for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4674/ldlc" data-tooltip-id="uid1605331699">LDLC</a> to advance in their title run.</p>
                  <p>What is now just an anecdote in the annals of history was at the time a source of grief for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a>, whose teammate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3055/flusha" data-tooltip-id="uid1556445744">Robin <span>&#34;⁠flusha⁠&#34;</span> Rönnquist</a> was already routinely accused of being a cheater. &#34;We got a lot of hate,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> recalls. &#34;I was very close to quitting the game after that.&#34; It wasn&#39;t just the fans, either. It was also other players going out and commenting negatively on the boost incident in interviews and on social media. Amid the controversy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> broke into the Top 20 Players of the Year list for the first time in 2014, ranking 12th.</p>

                    <p>olofmeister turned hate into fuel going into 2015, the year he was crowned the world&#39;s best player</p>
                  </div>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid1472580405">fnatic</a>&#39;s status as the bad boys of Counter-Strike was cemented, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> decided he wasn&#39;t going to let this incident bring him down, using the hate to fuel the next era of his career. &#34;It kind of changed me a little bit,&#34; he says. &#34;I was very nervous going to tournaments [before], having to perform, and in 2015, I was bit like... &#39;Fuck you guys, then. I&#39;m going to do this my way, so let&#39;s play.&#39; I wasn&#39;t that nervous [anymore], and that kind of helped me become a better player.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The negative reaction also helped the team bond over wanting to silence the haters. &#34;We wanted to show them that we&#39;re here to play,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> says, &#34;that we&#39;re good, and it kind of made us closer as a team because it&#39;s us against everyone. That helped us to play as well as we did, and it was a good experience in the end. I think we played better because of it.&#34;</p>

                    <p>olofmeister became a back-to-back Major champion in his 2015 career year</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>After the new year, the victories continued in 2016, with another three added to the winning streak on LAN, bringing it up to six. Once again, though, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid451230935">fnatic</a> fell when it mattered most, this time at the MLG Columbus Major. It was followed up by a loss in the inaugural season of ELEAGUE, and from there the Swedes failed to win another trophy, which ended up with a rift in the team that sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3849/jw" data-tooltip-id="uid753062295">Jesper <span>&#34;⁠JW⁠&#34;</span> Wecksell</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3055/flusha" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1556445744">flusha</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6902/godsent" data-tooltip-id="uid928129797">GODSENT</a>.</p>
                  <p>Counter-Strike was still a very different beast from what it has become, and teams had no outside support. No mental coach, nobody to lean on during hard times, and all of the success that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid451230935">fnatic</a>&#39;s young players got so quickly at a time of major growth for the game ended up exploding.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I think it was two things,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> says of the breakup. &#34;One was that we kind of got success a bit too easily. We didn&#39;t really struggle because we were winning too fast, in a way, and I think that the scene grew so fast at the same time we did. Everything happened so fast, and our team was maybe not ready for that. We didn&#39;t have people outside of the team who could have helped us.</p>
                  <p>&#34;When you&#39;re inside the team bubble, and you&#39;re annoyed with someone, or you clash heads, it&#39;s hard to take a step back and look at it and talk about it. Maybe we needed what every team has now, a mental coach,&#34; he adds. &#34;And we all knew we made a mistake, right? Otherwise, we wouldn&#39;t have connected again.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We just probably needed more help from the outside back then, and not only that, I think we needed to be a bit more mature with getting help from the outside, because we were all young and a little bit immature. It was a learning experience and, as I said, it wasn&#39;t too easy, but we had too much success too fast.&#34;</p>
                  <p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> had been dealing with another career-altering event that started after IEM Katowice, the last of the six straight LANs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/4991/fnatic" data-tooltip-id="uid451230935">fnatic</a> won, a wrist injury affecting his mouse hand. &#34;It just happened after Katowice,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> remembers. &#34;After I got home, I was going to practice, and I felt really weird, and it just never went away.&#34;</p>

                    <p>IEM Katowice 2016 was olofmeister&#39;s last win in the black and gold</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>It was a knee injury that got him off the football pitch and into Counter-Strike as a 15-year-old, and now a wrist injury was putting his Counter-Strike career at stake. &#34;It was very tough, especially going to a lot of different specialists who really couldn&#39;t say what was wrong,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> shares. &#34;That was the most frustrating part. I think it&#39;s a pinched nerve, but I still don&#39;t really know because I still have problems with it.&#34;</p>
                  <p>When aiming in a certain direction, his arm would stutter instead of making a smooth movement, and it couldn&#39;t have happened at a worse time. &#34;That was very annoying at the start and very frustrating that it started right before the Major because I feel like those games, when we were winning everything, I was probably playing the best Counter-Strike I&#39;ve ever played, having the confidence from getting #1 in 2015,&#34; he recalls. &#34;I was extremely confident in everything I did. Also, it being a Major was even more annoying, probably the most annoying because we couldn&#39;t really practice before the Major, either.&#34;</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> won the sixth and last MVP medal of his career at IEM Katowice in 2016, and was named the eighth-best player of the year despite working through his new condition in an already struggling side that failed to bring in another title. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3055/flusha" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1556445744">flusha</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3849/jw" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid753062295">JW</a> returned at the start of 2017, but that team&#39;s time had already expired, and they didn&#39;t win anything in the first half of the year.</p>
                  <p>The loss of confidence stemming from his injury could have brought <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> to his knees, but instead, he used it to refocus his career. &#34;That was also one of the reasons that I joined FaZe,&#34; he says, before admitting that he may have done it anyway, regardless of the injury.</p>
                  <p>&#34;But I also took a step back, and I could play a different type of role and just play to the best of my abilities,&#34; he adds, &#34;and to be able to play with those guys in FaZe was amazing. I just wish that I could have been the player... Like, I didn&#39;t have to be the number one player, but just to have the same aim and be the same level of player with that FaZe lineup. It would have been very interesting to see what could have happened because I think that we could have won a Major or two, maybe.&#34;</p>
                  <p>It took exactly one bad event for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6667/faze" data-tooltip-id="uid2046702524">FaZe</a> to get going, a group stage exit at DreamHack Masters Malmö. After that, they won ESL One New York with one of the most dominating performances ever seen in CS:GO, winning every map while keeping their rivals below 10 rounds in all but one. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a>&#39;s 1.27 at the event in the US was the highest he&#39;d post on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/6667/faze" data-tooltip-id="uid2046702524">FaZe</a>.</p>

                    <p>FaZe and olofmeister got off to a bright start with one of the most dominant runs in CS:GO history at ESL One New York 2017</p>
                  </div>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> made his last appearance on the Top 20 Players of the Year list in 2017, coming in 19th as he changed gears and reinvented himself in his new team. &#34;Joining up with big personalities was a lot of fun,&#34;he recalls. &#34;Probably the most fun I&#39;ve had in my career. Everyone had a big personality in different ways, and we got along very fast outside of the server.&#34;</p>
                  <p>After winning three titles in 2017, the fun was paused in early 2018, as a painful loss with big repercussions came at the Boston Major, which went down in history as North America&#39;s greatest achievement after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5752/cloud9" data-tooltip-id="uid367038432">Cloud9</a> came back from 11-15 in the Major grand final&#39;s decider map to win it in overtime.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think we ever fully recovered from that game because it was not only that, we went to Katowice, and we also lost a final in a bad way,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> says, &#34;and it was very hard to get our confidence back from that time, as well.</p>
                  <p>&#34;It&#39;s one of those games that I will never forget, and I don&#39;t think the other guys will ever forget, either,&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> adds. &#34;We should have won that game.&#34; He still hasn&#39;t watched that final fully through. That comeback was the closest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2757/guardian" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid137907825">GuardiaN</a> would ever get to a Major trophy despite playing in three finals, and was the beginning of a saga for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3741/niko" data-tooltip-id="uid1089625600">Nikola <span>&#34;⁠NiKo⁠&#34;</span> Kovač</a> in pursuit of a Major trophy that is still ongoing.</p>

                    <p>olofmeister has still not brought himself to rewatch the Boston Major grand final that FaZe choked against Cloud9</p>

                    <p>olofmeister is thankful for how FaZe and his teammates accommodated him in the late stage of his career</p>

                  <p>&#34;I think that back then I didn&#39;t know, right?&#34; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> says of how he faded out of competition without a big send-off or a clear retirement. &#34;I&#39;m not a guy who wants to do big things, but of course I regret it a little bit. It should have been done earlier, in a better way, but back then, I had no idea.&#34;</p>
                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a>&#39;s final stint came in 2021, when the team was waiting to get <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11816/ropz" data-tooltip-id="uid1840978134">Robin <span>&#34;⁠ropz⁠&#34;</span> Kool</a>. &#34;As I said, I&#39;m very thankful for what the organization and the players did for me, so of course I was going to help them when they needed it,&#34; he says, &#34;but back then, I still had some offers, and I was still thinking about it.</p>
                  <p>&#34;It was also because of the injury, right? Because if I&#39;m going to compete at tier one, I want to feel like I can provide what&#39;s needed and not just be 80% of what I can be because that&#39;s very frustrating to play with, and it just kind of is what it is.&#34;</p>
                  <p>Looking back on his career, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/885/olofmeister" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid895647680">olofmeister</a> is proud of his achievements. &#34;I just wish that I enjoyed it more,&#34; he says. &#34;To travel the world, play the game I love in front of so many fans in big arenas... It&#39;s still amazing, and something I will remember for the rest of my life. It&#39;s everywhere, right? It&#39;s so hard to put into words what a ride it has been, you know?</p>
                  <p>&#34;It has been amazing, and something that I don&#39;t think you can ever replace with anything else. You have to accept what it has been, and be very thankful that it happened. But man, traveling the world to play Counter-Strike? That&#39;s a pretty cool thing to do.&#34;</p>
