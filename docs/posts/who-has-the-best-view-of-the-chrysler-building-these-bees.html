But on and around some of New York City’s most iconic buildings, beehives are buzzing seven days a week.</p><p>At the Empire State Building, on a roof of Madison Square Garden and on a terrace adjacent to the Chrysler Building, thousands of veritable worker bees have been turning nectar into honey.</p><p>On an unseasonably warm Friday in November, a pair of professional beekeepers in protective gear stood on an 11th-floor terrace and tended to a pair of hives filled with Italian honeybees. The insects would not thrive up near the iconic spire of the Chrysler Building that loomed over them, but “here, they’re perfect,” said Matthew Flood, one of the beekeepers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>He and his co-worker, Titus Ogilvie-Laing, blew smoke from silver canisters to calm the bees before opening the hives. Using metal tools shaped like small crowbars, they pried frames out of the wooden hive boxes. Each frame was covered with hundreds of bees and filled with combs brimming with raw honey.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A close-up of a bee hive with many bees." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/07/multimedia/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb/00chrysler-bees--01-qjgb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d7ae9f2e-e9f8-573b-b5ba-f50922560ee8" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Italian honeybees.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Matthew Flood, left, and Titus Ogilvie-Laing work for Best Bees as beekeepers, maintaining various hives around the city.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The honey would sustain the bees through the winter months, when they stop traveling to Central Park and other nearby garden spots and hunker together in their hives, trying to stay warm, Mr. Flood said. By mid-autumn, they normally would have crowded together to form a “football,” trying to maintain a temperature in the hive of about 95 degrees, he said.</p><p>But as the climate changes, “the calendar keeps getting pushed back,” Mr. Flood said.</p><p>The beekeepers’ mission that day was to treat the hives with formic acid to ward off harmful mites. They also inspected each hive, looking for the queen, and assessing the health of the other bees.</p><p>These hives belong to the <a href="https://usa.um.dk/en/about-us/danish-missions/consulate-general-of-denmark-new-york" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Danish Consulate</a> and the Danish Mission to the United Nations, which are tenants of a glass-walled office building on 42nd Street that connects at the ground level to the Chrysler Building. The bees are a source of curiosity and comfort to about 100 people who work there, said Katinka Friis Petersen, a spokeswoman for the consulate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“People are always interested,” she said. “Everyone is always like, ‘You have bees?’”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The hives are on a terrace of Chrysler East, an annex of the Chrysler Building.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Ogilvie-Laing and Mr. Flood examined the pair of hives on an 11th-floor terrace of Chrysler East.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>As the beekeepers exited a freight elevator on the ground floor with Mr. Ogilvie-Laing wearing his protective gear, another worker said, “Are you guys still dressed from Halloween or what?”</p><p>The consulate contracts with <a href="https://bestbees.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Best Bees</a>, the Queens-based employer of Mr. Flood and Mr. Ogilvie-Laing, to manage the hives. Best Bees maintains hives in a variety of locations around the metropolitan area, including the Hunter’s Point South apartment complex in Long Island City, MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and Madison Square Garden, said Paige Mulhern, the company’s creative director.</p><p>Mr. Ogilvie-Laing, who also works part time in the photo and video department of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, said he caught a glimpse of Billy Joel rehearsing at the Garden while visiting hives on a rooftop of the arena.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Ms. Mulhern said the popularity of urban beehives was driven in part by “the whole corporate sustainability movement.” Many commercial buildings have set sustainability standards “to make sure they are being environmentally responsible,” she said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Flood’s employer maintain hives at other buildings in New York City, including MetLife Stadium and Madison Square Garden, the company said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Each wooden frame inside a hive was covered with hundreds of bees and filled with combs brimming with raw honey.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It really boomed right after Covid,” Ms. Mulhern said. Employers hoping to lure workers back to their offices tried “using nature to inspire or self-soothe” by adding elements like waterfalls or green roofs, she said.</p><p>Empire State Realty Trust said in its 2023 sustainability report that it had a total of about 200,000 honeybees in apiaries at the <a href="https://www.esrtreit.com/blog/sustainability/all-the-buzz-new-tiny-tenants-at-esrt/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Empire State Building</a> and three other properties it owns in New York City. The hives produce about 100 jars of honey, which the company shares with tenants and employees to raise awareness of the role buildings can play in urban biodiversity, the report said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>One of the company’s tenants on the West Side of Manhattan, CookFox Architects, has its own <a href="https://cookfox.com/projects/cookfox-apiary/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apiary</a> on a 17th-floor terrace on West 57th Street that is maintained by members of the firm’s staff, said Jared A. Gilbert, a spokesman for CookFox.</p><p>To reach the hives at the Empire State Building, Cassandra Sperl, a beekeeper, said she had to arrive before 8 a.m. and climb out an office window before hopping onto the sixth-floor setback where they were kept. Ms. Sperl said she also maintained hives on the roof of the sprawling <a href="https://www.stuytown.com/community/our-sustainability-initiatives/rooftop-honeybee-hive-program/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StuyTown</a> apartment complex on the East Side of Manhattan.</p><p>“A lot of people get freaked out the first couple of weeks they’re on the building,” Ms. Sperl said. “Some people want nothing to do with them.”</p><p>But, she added, “most people do love the bees. I think most people understand that we are ambassadors for the pollinators.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick McGeehan is a Times reporter who covers the economy of New York City and its airports and other transportation hubs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-mcgeehan">More about Patrick McGeehan</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
