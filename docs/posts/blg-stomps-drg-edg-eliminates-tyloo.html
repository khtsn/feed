</span>. BLG dominated DRG 2-0 to secure their place in the middle final, while EDG defeated TYLOO once again to break into the top five.</p>



<p>In a contest to earn the first middle bracket slot, BLG completely shut DRG out of the match, winning 2-0 and putting themselves one win away from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2760/valorant-masters-santiago-2026" target="_blank">Masters Santiago</a>.</p>

<p>DRG picked <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598940/dragon-ranger-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mr4/?game=245257&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Split</a> for the first map. BLG took the lead to start, finding major success in the clutch department with a 2v5 from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/4885/whzy">
		whzy	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/10698/nephh">

</span> in round four and a 1v4 from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/56260/bud">

</span> in round 9. </p>

<p><span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/52904/akeman">
		Akeman	</a>
</span> was the key player to keep DRG in the game, as the Neon player went 16/8 in the half despite his team trailing 7-5. The second half was all BLG as they ran away to a 13-6 win; DRG&#39;s attack looked disjointed, with the Duelists Akeman and <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/31753/spiritz1">
		SpiritZ1	</a>
</span> frequently getting caught out alone and picked off.</p>

<p>BLG continued where they left off on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598940/dragon-ranger-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mr4/?game=245258&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a>, shutting down DRG&#39;s unconventional Reyna and Veto composition with relative ease in a 13-2 showing. Nearly everything went BLG&#39;s way, including both pistols, a bonus round, multiple close clutches, and an ace apiece from <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/48878/rushia">
		rushia	</a>
</span> and nephh. While nephh had the most kills by a slim margin with 18, rushia was a first pick machine on Astra as the B site anchor with a 6-0 FK/FD differential.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb4BIqbCvKU?si=A8lu8QaWUFQgkLOy&amp;clip=UgkxcQFSlQ_uk9BsyEnI_qZmKi0medInZRKR&amp;clipt=EOzszwIYqrzRAg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>rushia locks down B by himself.</em></p>

<p>BLG now have two chances at Santiago qualification. Their first opportunity will be in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598941/bilibili-gaming-vs-tbd-vct-2026-china-kickoff-mbf" target="_blank">middle final</a> on Sunday, February 8 against the loser of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598931/all-gamers-vs-xi-lai-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-ubf" target="_blank">All Gamers versus Xi Lai Gaming</a>.</p>



<p>EDG and TYLOO already met once before this event in an encounter that went 2-0 the way of EDG. With the stakes higher than ever, EDG reaffirmed their caliber with a 2-1 victory, extending their flawless all-time head-to-head against TYLOO and knocking them out of Kickoff.</p>

<p>EDG played multiple unusual compositions throughout the series, starting off with Phoenix and Harbor on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598948/tyloo-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr4/?game=245283&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>. The plan ultimately fell flat for them as TYLOO dominated the map 13-3. First kills were the name of the game for the winning side on their defense as TYLOO racked up an overwhelming 11 first kills out of 12 rounds in the first half. </p>

<p><span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3049/sword9">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="11">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/39485/scales">
		Scales	</a>
</span> both had stellar performances, the former going 20/6/6 with 231 ADR on Fade and the latter going 17/6/4 with 176 ADR on Viper. The pair shared eight of the team&#39;s 13 first kills between them. </p>

<p><em>sword9 was a safe pair of hands for TYLOO on Bind.</em></p>

<p>On Haven, EDG swapped off the Yoru and Iso they had been playing in favor of <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/39697/cb">
		cb	</a>
</span> on Neon and <span data-ref-id="13">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> on Chamber. At first, the map seemed to go similarly to Bind. Although ZmjjKK managed to get five first kills, <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/55085/erv">
		Erv	</a>
</span> led TYLOO to an 8-4 half with an unreal 19/6/7 KDA, 267 ADR performance with major multikills and clutches.</p>

<p>Round 13 was the start of a complete reversal. EDG won a full eco round after losing the pistol and took that momentum to win every single remaining round in the map to take Haven 13-9. ZmjjKK had unmatched confidence with his signature attack Operator, picking up five first kills in the half for 10 total over the course of the map and topping the server with 22 kills. </p>

<p>EDG stayed in control on <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/598948/tyloo-vs-edward-gaming-vct-2026-china-kickoff-lr4/?game=245285&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Corrode</a>, where they started by winning yet another eco in round two. From there, the execute power of their Yoru, Phoenix, and Sage picks overwhelmed TYLOO&#39;s defenses, earning EDG purchase onto the sites and an 8-4 score at the half. Even with another pistol round, TYLOO couldn&#39;t find their way back in as EDG closed out 13-7.</p>
