    <h1>New York City Will Get Some Rain, but Not Enough to Ease Its Drought</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New York City was expected to receive some rain on Wednesday night. That would be a partial respite after weeks of abnormally dry conditions led the authorities to declare the city’s first drought warning in over 20 years, but not enough to ease the crisis.</p><p>About 2.2 inches of rain was forecast to fall in the city, and slightly more in parts of New Jersey, between Wednesday night and Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service. The heaviest deluge was expected overnight and into Thursday.</p><p>The rain in the city will start to ease the unusually dry conditions that led Mayor Eric Adams to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/nyregion/drought-warning-new-york.html" title="">declare a drought warning</a> on Monday and urge residents to conserve water. Such a warning is the last step before a drought emergency, which would include mandatory water restrictions.</p><p>Officials have said the rain will not be enough to fully replenish the city’s reservoirs, which are at about 60 percent of their total capacity, down from the usual 79 percent. It is “not a drought buster, but it will help, especially with ongoing fire weather issues,” the Weather Service’s New York office <a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1858850977186504827" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>.</p></div></div>
