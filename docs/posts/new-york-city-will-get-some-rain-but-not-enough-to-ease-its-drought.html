That would be a partial respite after weeks of abnormally dry conditions led the authorities to declare the city’s first drought warning in over 20 years, but not enough to ease the crisis.</p><p>About 2.2 inches of rain was forecast to fall in the city, and slightly more in parts of New Jersey, between Wednesday night and Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service. The heaviest deluge was expected overnight and into Thursday.</p><p>The rain in the city will start to ease the unusually dry conditions that led Mayor Eric Adams to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/nyregion/drought-warning-new-york.html" title="">declare a drought warning</a> on Monday and urge residents to conserve water. Such a warning is the last step before a drought emergency, which would include mandatory water restrictions.</p><p>Officials have said the rain will not be enough to fully replenish the city’s reservoirs, which are at about 60 percent of their total capacity, down from the usual 79 percent. It is “not a drought buster, but it will help, especially with ongoing fire weather issues,” the Weather Service’s New York office <a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1858850977186504827" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on social media</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/nyregion/new-york-wildfires-drought.html" title="">extraordinarily dry fall</a> in New York City and the Northeast has sparked wildfires across the region and brought some of the worst drought conditions in decades.<span>  </span>Parts of southern New York State, including New York City, have been in a severe drought for about a week. About a quarter of New Jersey has been in an extreme drought for two weeks.</p><p>A severe drought is the second level of a four level scale, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System, and an extreme drought is the third. The highest level is an exceptional drought.</p><p>Moderate to heavy rain was expected to fall in the region overnight and into Thursday, before becoming lighter, the Weather Service said. Strong winds, with gusts of up to 30 miles her hour, were also expected overnight and into early Thursday.</p><p>The Northwest is also expected to see its first snowfall of the season this week. About 2.5 inches were forecast to fall in West Milford, New Jersey, between Thursday and Saturday.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
