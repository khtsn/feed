Quick to supply almost any manufactured product at a low cost, they employ millions of migrant workers from all over China.</p><p>Now many of these small factories, cornerstones of the Chinese economy, are confronting difficult times. Clothing factory managers fret about a spate of orders from American customers being canceled at the last minute, saddling them with losses. Managers of factories making machinery wonder whether their low costs will help them survive. And workers hope they will still have jobs in the coming weeks and months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A view from above of a person carrying stacks of metal parts in a large factory space, with many stacks of metal objects around him." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/09/multimedia/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq/BIZ-TARIFF-GUANGZHOU-04-mjlq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/b6c3890c-e636-595f-bb41-157edd09b630" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A small factory in Guangzhou, China, makes ovens, fryers and other equipment for restaurants and backyard barbecuers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A few garment factories that mainly supplied the United States market have already closed temporarily as their owners wait for more clarity on tariffs. Managers of many more factories are now hurrying to find buyers in other countries or chase down customers in China.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But China already faced a huge glut of factory capacity even before Mr. Trump began closing the American market this year to many imports from China. Customers elsewhere have demanded ever deeper discounts.</p><p>Ruinously low prices for manufacturers have become particularly prevalent in the domestic market in China. Many Chinese consumers are now extremely frugal after losing their life savings in the country’s housing market crash.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A worker ironing fabric on Wednesday in a garment factory in Guangzhou, China.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“The trade war has a huge impact, because if you can’t export, there will be fewer orders for clothing, and there will be nothing to do,” said Ling Meilan, co-owner of a shirt factory on the second floor of a concrete building in a vast warren of low industrial buildings. Workers hunched over sewing machines on long tables under fluorescent lights.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Ling focuses on the domestic market in China. But some neighboring factories that sell primarily to the United States have already temporarily suspended operations.</p><p>A factory manager down the street who gave only her family name, Yao, said that she mainly supplied Amazon and had already seen a slowing of orders. “If the U.S. tariffs are too high, we can’t do it, and I will definitely switch to other markets,” she said.</p><p>The recent cancellations of clothing orders have been particularly hard on small factories in Guangzhou. American importers often pay half the cost of garments upfront and the rest later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Workers making clothes for Shein, an e-commerce company, in a garment factory in Guangzhou on Wednesday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Last-minute cancellations without compensation, by importers who do not want to pay Mr. Trump’s tariffs, have left some factories stuck with considerable inventories of everything from garments to handbags, factory managers said. The 50 percent down payments that they have received are not nearly enough to cover their costs.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Manufacturers of machinery may be somewhat better positioned to endure tariffs. China so utterly dominates some categories that it has few rivals in other countries.</p><p>Elon Li, who owns a small Guangzhou factory that makes low-priced cooking equipment for restaurants and backyard barbecuers, said that he did not worry about the latest American tariffs because all of his competitors were also located in or near Guangzhou.</p><p>Manufacturers in Japan, South Korea and Europe make equipment for the same tasks, but they use much more expensive materials and charge up to 10 times as much as he does. Factories in Southeast Asia and Africa have been unable to compete because only China makes low-cost electrical components, he said, fetching a waterproof on-off switch from a factory bench as an example.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A worker operating a stamping machine to cut out steel parts for appliances at a small factory in Guangzhou on Wednesday.

China’s property market meltdown has decimated construction in China and left a glut of steel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The retail price of cooking equipment in the United States is up to eight times the cost of making it in China, Mr. Li said. Tariffs are mostly calculated based on the very low manufacturing cost, before it is steeply marked up in the United States. So even a large tariff — Mr. Trump has now added 125 percent tariffs for Chinese goods in less than three months — may not do much to increase the retail price, since manufacturing costs are such a small part of the final price tag, Mr. Li said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A neighborhood in Guangzhou.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>One expense that has not fallen is labor. Managers at five Guangzhou factories all said that they had seen no sign in recent weeks that workers would accept lower wages. A decades-long slide in China’s birthrate has left a national shortage of factory workers, particularly among the young.</p><p>Decades of nearly continuous economic growth in China have left many manufacturers with an abiding faith that they will somehow overcome the latest difficulties.</p><p>“Our country is truly becoming stronger,” Ms. Ling said. “Personally, I am quite satisfied and have great confidence in China.”</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Keith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times.
