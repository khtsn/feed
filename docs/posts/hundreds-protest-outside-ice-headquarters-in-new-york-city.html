They raised bright yellow signs that said “ICE out of NYC” in Spanish and English.</p><p>A separate group stayed behind and spread out around the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office near Foley Square. The crowd there grew increasingly agitated as night fell, with some chanting “Nazi scum” and taunting police officers. Dozens of officers in riot gear flanked the protesters in an apparent effort to facilitate traffic, leading to the arrest of a number of demonstrators who were escorted away with their hands bound in zip ties throughout the evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After 10 p.m., a dwindling crowd of about 100 protesters clashed with police officers near Foley Square, with<span>  </span>some briefly marching downtown toward the entrance of the Brooklyn Bridge. Officers sought to keep people on sidewalks, pushing some demonstrators to the ground as they arrested them and using pepper spray during some of the arrests. Some people shouted and shoved the officers as they were led away in handcuffs.</p><p>As Mr. Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines to California, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who has largely aligned himself with Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda, said on Tuesday that he did not foresee Mr. Trump’s sending the military to New York City.</p><p>“If there’s ever a need to go beyond the manpower that we have, there’s other ways you do it before you have to come with the look of a military operation,” Mr. Adams said, citing the size and experience of New York City’s police force.</p><p>The rally on Tuesday evening appeared to be larger than the protests in New York during the past few days. Those earlier demonstrations were tense, resulting in arrests and small confrontations with law enforcement, but they did not devolve into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/08/us/la-immigration-protests-photos-map.html" title="">the visceral scenes of chaos</a> that appeared episodically in Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>While the protests in Los Angeles were largely peaceful, protesters and federal officers have engaged in violent clashes, with officers shooting flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets at protesters, who have thrown rocks, glass bottles and fireworks at the officers and have burned vehicles.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some demonstrators moved into the streets of Lower Manhattan while others remained in Foley Square near the ICE office.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

Dozens of migrants showing up for hearings have been detained by federal agents at the courthouse this month, sparking pushback from Democrats and drawing activists to the building. The imposing skyscraper also houses the ICE field office in New York.</p><p>On Tuesday, Andrea Montiel, 31, whose parents are Mexican immigrants, said she showed up at the rally on behalf of family and friends who she said were too worried about their immigration status to demonstrate publicly.</p><p>“I think we’re really here just because we hope we can make a difference and show ICE is not welcome,” she said, adding that New York and Los Angeles were connected by their large Hispanic populations. “We’re one community despite the distance.”</p><p>After speeches at the rally, which was organized by a coalition of unions and immigration groups, the crowd grew more disorganized as protesters, many of them masked, broke off to march on city streets, chanting “Abolish ICE” and waving Mexican and Palestinian flags.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Eva Stokes, 21, said she marched in support of her father, who is an immigrant from Mexico.</p><p>“My father could get deported at any time,” Ms. Stokes said with tears filling her eyes. “He already has been summoned, and, you know, it’s a scary process. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to lose my dad.”</p><p>As nightfall approached, one group of about 50 protesters reached Washington Square Park, dancing and clapping by the park’s fountain. </p><p>The first day of demonstrations in New York was Saturday, when more than 100 protesters gathered outside 26 Federal Plaza, where they clashed with police officers after the protesters tried to block ICE vehicles carrying detained migrants. The police said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/nyregion/ice-detention-federal-plaza-nyc.html" title="">22 people were taken into custody</a> as officers dispersed the crowd.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The police said they made several arrests during the demonstration.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

The Police Department <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/09/trump-tower-manhattan-ice-protest-arrests/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested at least 24 protesters</a> during that demonstration.</p><p>Later in the day, as concerns mounted that the protests in New York could spiral out of control, Mr. Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/eric-adams-nypd-los-angeles-protests.html" title="">issued brief remarks</a> alongside Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch. The mayor said he respected the right of New Yorkers to protest peacefully but vowed that “we will not allow violence and lawlessness.”</p><p>“The escalation of protests in Los Angeles over the last couple of days is unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our city,” Mr. Adams said. Commissioner Tisch said that any attack against police officers would “be met by a swift and decisive response by the N.Y.P.D.”</p><p>The city leaders gave the remarks just as a disjointed group of 200 protesters gathered near 26 Federal Plaza for a “ICE out of NYC” demonstration on Monday evening, leading to <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/09/protesters-rage-at-ice-arrests-amid-heavy-police-presence-at-foley-square-in-lower-manhattan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven arrests</a>.</p><p>Cassidy Jensen<!-- -->, <!-- -->Samantha Latson<!-- -->, <!-- -->Ana Ley<!-- -->, <!-- -->Emmett Lindner<!-- --> and <!-- -->Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Luis Ferré-Sadurní is a Times reporter covering immigration, focused on the influx of migrants arriving in the New York region.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
