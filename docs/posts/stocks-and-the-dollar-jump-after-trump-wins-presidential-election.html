Trump.</p><p>U.S. stock markets, which had risen steadily overnight as the votes were counted, surged on Wednesday as the outcome of the election became clear, putting an end to weeks of uncertainty. Traders also prepared their portfolios for the possibilities of bigger deficits and economic stimulus under a Trump administration.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose more than 2 percent, and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies most exposed to the U.S. economy, jumped 4 percent.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/technology/bitcoin-election-trump.html" title="">Bitcoin surged to record highs</a>, as Mr. Trump has promised to end the Biden administration’s regulatory push and establish the United States as the “crypto capital of the planet.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen as well as the euro, the Mexican peso and the Chinese yuan — the currencies of major trading partners expected to be heavily affected by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s proposal to substantially raise tariffs</a>.

<p>The dollar index this year</p>
</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Yields on U.S. government bonds climbed sharply. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 0.2 percentage points — a big move in that market — to more than 4.4 percent. Shorter-dated bond yields rose by less, as the Federal Reserve was expected to continue to cut interest rates in the coming months, including at its meeting that will conclude on Thursday.</p><p>In October, investors started driving up yields and pushing the dollar higher against global currencies as they started to see a better chance of a Republican victory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>This was caused in part by the expectation that Mr. Trump’s proposed policies on taxes, trade and immigration might bolster economic growth even as they would increase government spending. Together, analysts believe, they would drive interest rates higher over time.</p></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-7"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="datawrapper_tAh7X" data-id="100000009809407" data-source-id="100000009809407"><div slug="datawrapper_tAh7X" data-sourceid="100000009809407" id="embed-id-100000009809407">

Investors’ initial bets that central banks would cut rates more to bolster the region’s economies, especially those of export-oriented nations such as Germany, gave way to the prospects of higher inflation from the weak currency. “The market has clearly yet to settle on a consensus narrative,” analysts at Rabobank said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But there were some early losers in European markets as shares in automakers, like BMW and Volvo, and renewable energy companies, including the Danish wind company Orsted, dropped on expectations of higher tariffs and less aggressive climate goals.</p><p>German business leaders warned that a second Trump presidency would further challenge Germany’s stagnating economy. The United States is the largest buyer of German products, especially pharmaceuticals, machinery and cars.</p><p>“The clear result of the U.S. elections is a wake-up call for Germany and Europe,” said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the Federation of German Industries.</p><p>Across Asia, stock markets extended gains from Tuesday. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 2.6 percent. Stocks in mainland China fell slightly, and Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong tumbled 2.2 percent.</p><p>Bruce Pang, chief economist for the greater China area at JLL, a real estate and investment management firm, said the Hong Kong stocks were down because the companies listed there were more exposed to a weaker Chinese currency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s more protectionist policies might also mean that Chinese policymakers will focus more on driving domestic demand in the economy instead of expecting exports to stimulate growth.</p><p>“There will be tensions geopolitically, but it’s still more predictable,” Mr. Pang said of a Trump victory. “There is some history there.”</p><h2 id="link-1ded408c">The ‘Trump’ Trades</h2><p>In the volatile cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin rose 7 percent in the last 24 hours to more than $74,000, eclipsing a record high set in March.
