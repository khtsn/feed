Investors’ initial bets that central banks would cut rates more to bolster the region’s economies, especially those of export-oriented nations such as Germany, gave way to the prospects of higher inflation from the weak currency. “The market has clearly yet to settle on a consensus narrative,” analysts at Rabobank said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But there were some early losers in European markets as shares in automakers, like BMW and Volvo, and renewable energy companies, including the Danish wind company Orsted, dropped on expectations of higher tariffs and less aggressive climate goals.</p><p>German business leaders warned that a second Trump presidency would further challenge Germany’s stagnating economy. The United States is the largest buyer of German products, especially pharmaceuticals, machinery and cars.</p><p>“The clear result of the U.S. elections is a wake-up call for Germany and Europe,” said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the Federation of German Industries.</p><p>Across Asia, stock markets extended gains from Tuesday. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 2.6 percent. Stocks in mainland China fell slightly, and Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong tumbled 2.2 percent.</p><p>Bruce Pang, chief economist for the greater China area at JLL, a real estate and investment management firm, said the Hong Kong stocks were down because the companies listed there were more exposed to a weaker Chinese currency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s more protectionist policies might also mean that Chinese policymakers will focus more on driving domestic demand in the economy instead of expecting exports to stimulate growth.</p><p>“There will be tensions geopolitically, but it’s still more predictable,” Mr. Pang said of a Trump victory. “There is some history there.”</p><h2 id="link-1ded408c">The ‘Trump’ Trades</h2><p>In the volatile cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin rose 7 percent in the last 24 hours to more than $74,000, eclipsing a record high set in March.
