    <h1>Threatened With Jail, Liz Cheney Condemns Trump’s ‘Assault on the Rule of Law’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Her statement came after Mr. Trump repeated his unfounded allegation that the committee destroyed evidence during its investigation.</p><p>“Cheney did something that’s inexcusable, along with Thompson and the people on the un-select committee of political thugs and, you know, creeps,” he said, referring to Representative Bennie G. Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the committee’s chairman. “They deleted and destroyed all evidence.”</p><p>He went on: “And Cheney was behind it. And so was Bennie Thompson and everybody on that committee. For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.”</p><p>In fact, the committee did not destroy all evidence. It released an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/23/us/january-6-committee-final-report.html" title="">800-page report</a> as well as 140 transcripts of testimony and various memos, emails and voice mail messages. The evidence <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/january-6th-committee-final-report?path=/GPO/January%206th%20Committee%20Final%20Report%20and%20Supporting%20Materials%20Collection" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remains online</a>. Mr. Thompson explained <a href="https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/Thompson-letter-to-Loudermilk-7.7.23.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a letter last year</a> that the committee had asked the executive branch to go through some material first to protect “law enforcement sensitive operational details and private, personal information that, if released, could endanger the safety of witnesses.”</p><p>Ms. Cheney pointed to that letter in her statement on Sunday. “Donald Trump knows his claims about the select committee are ridiculous and false, as has been detailed extensively, including by Chairman Thompson,” she said. “There is no conceivably appropriate factual or constitutional basis for what Donald Trump is suggesting — a Justice Department investigation of the work of a congressional committee — and any lawyer who attempts to pursue that course would quickly find themselves engaged in sanctionable conduct.”</p></div></div>
