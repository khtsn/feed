The feat was another sign of China’s ambitions to project its power and prestige in space.</p><p>“While admiring the wondrous views in space, we also had a deep feeling of the weight and greatness of the manned space endeavor,” one of the astronauts, Mr. Song, said after the spacewalk on Tuesday, according to a <a href="https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?item_id=12601318990182955603&amp;toc_style_id=feeds_default&amp;share_to=wechat&amp;track_id=2a70acfb-53d9-420c-aade-d984223896a0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chinese state television report</a>.</p><p>The astronauts blasted into space <a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/china-launches-3-astronauts-to-tiangong-space-station-on-shenzhou-19-mission" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in late October</a> as part of a mission to build and maintain China’s Tiangong Space Station. They were accompanied by a third astronaut-engineer, Wang Haoze, who stayed inside the space station during the spacewalk, helping her colleagues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The three astronauts are scheduled to spend six months in orbit on the Tiangong station, holding experiments and performing a series of spacewalks, Chinese news reports <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2024/1105/c90000-20237622.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have said</a>. Chinese space planners hope that the Tiangong mission will be a steppingstone to sending astronauts to the moon in coming years.</p><p>The first <a href="http://www.spacefacts.de/eva/e_eva.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spacewalk took place in 1965</a>, when a Soviet astronaut spent 16 minutes outside his craft. Months later, an American astronaut <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/first-american-spacewalk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">completed one</a>. The first spacewalk by a Chinese astronaut was in 2008, <a href="https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202405/29/content_WS665677ecc6d0868f4e8e7965.html#:~:text=On%20Sept.,a%20single%20Chinese%20astronaut%20crew." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasting 19 minutes</a>.</p><p>China’s Manned Space Agency did not immediately claim the spacewalk as a world record, <a href="https://www.cmse.gov.cn/xwzx/202412/t20241217_56166.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simply noting</a> that it was the longest spacewalk for Chinese astronauts — perhaps waiting for international validation of a world record.</p><p>The agency also said that the two astronauts ventured outside the Tiangong — a dangerous activity even with careful preparation — for a serious purpose: installing equipment to protect the station from debris in space, and inspecting other equipment on its exterior.</p><p>The three astronauts are not the only life-forms on China’s space station. They are carrying fruit flies to study “how reduced magnetism and microgravity affect the behavior and growth” of the flies, according to the <a href="https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/cas_media/202410/t20241031_693323.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>.</p><p>Amy Chang Chien<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chris Buckley, the chief China correspondent for The Times, reports on China and Taiwan from Taipei, focused on politics, social change and security and military issues.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/chris-buckley">More about Chris Buckley</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
