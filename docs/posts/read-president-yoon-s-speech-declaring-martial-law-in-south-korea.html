This is a situation that is not only unprecedented in any country in the world, but has never been seen since the founding of our country.</p><p>It is paralyzing the judiciary by intimidating judges and impeaching a number of prosecutors, and it is paralyzing the executive branch by trying to impeach the Minister of the Interior, the Chairman of the Communications Commission, the Chair of the Board of Audit, and the Defense Minister.</p><p>The handling of the national budget also undermined the essential functions of the state and turned Korea into a drug paradise and a public order panic by completely cutting all major budgets for cracking down on drug crimes and maintaining public security. The Democratic Party cut 4.1 trillion won from next year’s budget, including 1 trillion won for disaster preparedness reserves, 38.4 billion won for child care support allowances, and a project to develop a gas field in the city for youth jobs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>They even put the brakes on funding to improve the treatment of military officers, including raising salaries and allowances for entry-level officers and increasing on-call duty fees.This budget outrage is nothing short of manipulating the national finances of the Republic of Korea. The legislative dictatorship of the Democratic Party, which uses even the budget as a means of political struggle, did not hesitate to impeach the budget. The government is paralyzed, and the people’s sighs are growing.</p><p>This trampling of the constitutional order of the free Republic of Korea and the disruption of legitimate state institutions established by the constitution and laws is an obvious anti-state act that plots insurrection. The lives of the people are of no concern, and the government is in a state of paralysis due to impeachment, special investigation, and the defense of the opposition leader.</p><p>Our National Assembly has become a den of criminals and is attempting to paralyze the nation’s judicial administration system through legislative dictatorship and overthrow the liberal democracy system. The National Assembly, which should be the foundation of liberal democracy, has become a monster that collapses the liberal democracy system. Now, Korea is in a precarious situation where it would not be surprising if it collapsed immediately.</p><p>Dear citizens, I declare emergency martial law to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces and to eradicate the shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people and to protect the free constitutional order.</p><p>Through this emergency martial law, I will rebuild and defend the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into ruin. To this end, I will surely eradicate the criminals of the anti-state forces who have been committing atrocities so far.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This is an inevitable step to ensure the freedom and safety of the people and the sustainability of the country, and to pass on a proper country to future generations from the unrestrained activities of anti-state forces aiming to overthrow the system. I will eradicate anti-state forces as soon as possible and normalize the country. I will crush the anti-state forces and normalize the country as soon as possible.</p><p>The declaration of martial law will cause some inconvenience to the good people who have believed in and followed the values of the Constitution of the free Republic of Korea, but I will focus on minimizing these inconveniences. These measures are necessary for the perpetuation of a free Republic of Korea, and there is no change in our foreign policy stance of fulfilling our responsibilities and contributions in the international community.</p><p>As your president, I earnestly appeal to you. I will devote my life to defending the free Republic of Korea, relying solely on the people. Please trust me. Thank you.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Undersea Surgeons: </strong>In a wireless world, it is easy to forget the cables that snake across the turbulent ocean floor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/30/world/africa/subsea-cables.html">Until they snap</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mexican Cartels Turn to Students:</strong> Cartels are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/americas/mexico-fentanyl-chemistry-students.html">luring university chemistry students in Mexico</a> with big paydays in their quest to build fentanyl empires.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Sinking Arctic Hamlet:</strong> Canada is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/americas/canada-arctic-permafrost-thawing.html">losing its permafrost to climate change</a>.
