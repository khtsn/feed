Trump, who was backed by top crypto executives, has promised less regulation for the industry. Even so, the price of Bitcoin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/02/28/sudden-1-trillion-crypto-market-shock-sees-bitcoin-plunge-under-80000-price/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has plunged</a> in recent days, stoking concern about crypto volatility.</p><p><strong>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau drops a lawsuit against Capital One.</strong> The agency, under acting director Russell Vought, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/cfpb-capital-one-lawsuit.html" title="">withdrew a case charging the lender</a> with cheating customers out of $2 billion in interest on their savings accounts. It was the most prominent instance yet of the Trump administration defanging the C.F.P.B., an agency many Republicans have sought to kill.</p><p><strong>Citigroup is said to have narrowly avoided another “fat-finger” disaster.</strong> The bank had intended to send $280 to a client — but instead <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9921925e-5a32-48cc-a3e3-3f77042477d2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">credited it with $82 trillion</a>, according to The Financial Times.

Trump accused the network of deceptively editing the interview; CBS said Trump’s lawsuit was without merit.</p><p>But when the board gathered this month, Redstone was clear: She was in favor of resolving the issue, two people familiar with the matter told DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and The Times’s Ben Mullin.</p><p>As Paramount executives weighed the best course of action, Redstone said she was in favor of moving forward in a way that would lead to some form of conclusion, including mediation.</p><p><strong>It was the first time that Redstone made her wishes known to the full board.</strong> Many at CBS News and “60 Minutes,” where Harris’s interview aired, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/business/media/cbs-news-60-minutes-trump.html" title="">strongly opposed</a> a settlement.</p><p><strong>Further complicating the matter:</strong> The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing Paramount’s pending deal with Skydance. Some executives believe that a settlement would smooth the way to closing the merger,<strong> </strong>even as others worry that a settlement could be interpreted as bribery for the F.C.C. to clear the Skydance deal. Trump, for his part, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000010015138/trump-musk-cabinet-meeting.html" title="">told reporters Wednesday</a> that the two were not linked.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>National Amusements, Paramount’s parent company, declined to comment, and Paramount has said that its legal battle with Mr. Trump is unrelated to its deal with Skydance.</p><p>Redstone’s<strong> </strong>carefully written statement did not mention Paramount’s deal with Skydance — but it did underscore the fact that a pending multibillion-dollar lawsuit from the president made it difficult for Paramount to do business. Redstone also said that she was removing herself from day-to-day discussions about the lawsuit.</p><p>Earlier this week, The Times reported that Paramount had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/business/media/paramount-trump-60-minutes-lawsuit-cbs.html" title="">agreed to bring in a mediator</a>.</p><p><strong>Any settlement could be perceived as the latest corporate concession to the White House</strong>, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/business/media/trump-abc-settlement.html" title="">Disney’s $15 million settlement</a> in December and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/technology/meta-trump-lawsuit-settlement.html" title="">Meta’s $25 million settlement</a> last month. The possibility of a settlement, which is likely to further embolden Trump’s crusade against the media, has been met with a strong <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/business/media/cbs-news-60-minutes-trump.html" title="">backlash within the CBS ranks</a> and outside the company.</p><p>Though Redstone didn’t mention the Skydance deal in her remarks, people familiar with her thinking believe she’s focused on closing the deal.</p><p>Paramount is also navigating the consequences of doing business under a retributive president.

She didn’t say how many eggs would be imported.</p><p>Turkey said it would export <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/02/24/business/egg-prices-turkey-vaccine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">420 million</a> eggs to the U.S. That might seem like a lot — but it amounts only to the number of eggs the U.S. <a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/fb494842n/6395z3349/d504tg591/ckeg0225.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produces</a> <a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/fb494842n/6395z3349/d504tg591/ckeg0225.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a day and a half</a>.</p><p><strong>The U.S. would need to import </strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>lot</em></strong><strong> more to make a dent in prices</strong>. In 2024, the United States produced <a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/1v53jw96n/4b29d373g/4455b918n/ckegan25.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">109 billion eggs</a>. For prices to come down noticeably it would need to import eggs in the billions, said Bruce Babcock, an agricultural economist and professor at the University of California, Riverside.</p><p><strong>There are logistical roadblocks, too.</strong> Foreign countries might not have a surplus of eggs ready to export. “Other countries are also dealing with the avian influenza,” said Chad Hart, an agriculture professor at Iowa State University. On top of that is the hurdle of transporting hundreds of millions of fragile eggs by air, he said.</p><p><strong>Trump’s tariff plans complicate the picture. </strong>The president said on Thursday that sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect next week, and that he would impose an additional 10 percent tariff on China. Tariffs discourage imports, a strategy at odds with his administration’s effort to source more eggs. That could turn eggs into a possible negotiation tactic for countries that find themselves in his cross hairs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“You might see eggs will be one of the things that is left off the tariff list,” Hart said. “But if the president is talking about tariffs on everything, it does create a definite conflict in policy here.”</p><p>Even if enough egg imports do come through, some Democrats might still call for inquiries into the industry’s pricing practices. Five companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/egg-prices-bird-flu-producers.html" title="">control half the U.S. egg market</a>, leading to windfall revenue and profit for the biggest producer. A jury in 2023 found leading egg producers liable for unlawfully inflating prices in the early 2000s.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-7fc5663a">The Sergey Brin philosophy of work</h2><p>An army of Google programmers has been hyperfocused on keeping the tech giant at the forefront of artificial intelligence, as the company battles for supremacy with OpenAI and others.</p><p>But to Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder who helps oversee A.I. efforts, some employees aren’t working hard enough.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>He has expressed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/google-sergey-brin-return-to-office.html" title="">very particular view</a> of the kind of pace required for success, according to The Times’s Nico Grant:</p><blockquote><p>“I recommend being in the office at least every weekday,” he wrote in a memo posted internally on Wednesday evening that was viewed by The New York Times.
