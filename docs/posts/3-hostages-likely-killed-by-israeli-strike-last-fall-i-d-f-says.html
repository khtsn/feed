The findings also suggest that senior Hamas officials, including Yahya Sinwar, the most powerful figure in the group, may surround themselves with hostages as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/world/middleeast/gaza-war-hamas-yahya-sinwar.html" title="">U.S. and Israeli officials have said</a>.</p><p>In its statement, the Israeli military <a href="https://idfanc.activetrail.biz/150924454545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it was “highly likely”</a> that the hostages, Cpl. Nik Beizer, Sgt. Ron Sherman and Elia Toledano, were killed “as a result of a byproduct” of an Israeli military strike targeting Ahmed al-Ghandour, the commander of Hamas’s military wing in northern Gaza.</p><p>The military said it was presenting “a high-probability assessment” based on where the hostages’ bodies were found in December, as well as intelligence materials, an analysis of the strike, pathological reports and the conclusions of forensic examiners. Definitively determining the cause of their deaths, the military said, was not possible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The I.D.F. shares in the grief of the families over the devastating loss,” the military said.</p><p>The three slain hostages, the investigation indicated, were in a tunnel complex used by Mr. al-Ghandour, a top official whose death Hamas later acknowledged. The Israeli military said it had information at the time suggesting that the three hostages were in another place.</p><p>The announcement on Sunday came as advocates for the hostages and their families were demanding that Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, do more to secure a deal with Hamas for the release of the dozens of living hostages still in Gaza, even if that allows Hamas to survive the war with Israel.</p><p>During the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks, militants abducted roughly 250 hostages to Gaza, including women, children and elderly people. Around 100 total, including living hostages and bodies, are still in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu and his supporters want to hold out for a deal that would make it easier for the Israeli military to continue fighting Hamas after a short truce — even if playing hardball delays the hostages’ freedom and more die in captivity. Hamas has demanded a permanent end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p><p>The prime minister has also said a central part of his strategy to bring hostages home is to put constant military pressure on Hamas, though many analysts and critics say this approach has put the captives at risk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since soldiers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages-ceasefire.html" title="">discovered the bodies of six hostages</a> in a subterranean tunnel in southern Gaza in late August, a number of major protests in support of bringing the hostages home have occurred in Tel Aviv.
