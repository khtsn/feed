They were the first people to travel the length of the Americas in an amphibious vehicle.</p><p>Frank and Helen Schreider went on to indulge their wanderlust in India, Africa, the Middle East and the Amazon Basin, making documentary films and writing of their lengthy journeys in books and in articles for National Geographic magazine.</p><p>It wasn’t until 2015 — 59 years after her husband — that Ms. Schreider was belatedly inducted into the Explorers Club herself, once it had dropped its gender barrier. Faanya Rose, the club’s first woman president, told her: “You went exploring knowing there was no accolade for women. It was just the pure passion and the pure curiosity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Schreider, a former art student who always traveled with drawing pad and colored pencils to record her wide-ranging explorations, died on Feb. 6 in Santa Rosa, Calif.

They completed six long assignments for National Geographic magazine from 1957 to 1969, beginning with a second trip by amphibious jeep along the Ganges River in India.</p><p>They followed up with a 13-month journey through the Indonesian archipelago, which they recounted in a book, “The Drums of Tonkin” (1963).</p><p>Trips by Land Rover followed, first in the Great Rift Valley of Africa and then along a 24,000-mile route from Greece to India in the footsteps of Alexander the Great.</p><p>Their last expedition, in 1969, was to map the Amazon River from its headwaters in the Peruvian Andes, which they navigated in a small boat they built themselves. Their National Geographic book “Exploring the Amazon” (1970) made the disputed claim that the Amazon, not the Nile, is the world’s longest river. (The Schreiders added the Para River in the Amazon’s mouth to its overall length, though others considered the Para part of another system; <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/nile-river/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most cartographers today</a> agree that the Nile is longer.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Schreiders’ book “Exploring the Amazon” (1970) made the disputed claim that the Amazon, not the Nile, is the world’s longest river.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">National Geographic</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>That same year, 1970, the couple parted ways with the magazine. They divorced a few years later and pursued individual careers.</p><p>Mr. Schreider became a freelance writer and crossed the Atlantic Ocean in his 40-foot sailboat, Sassafras. He was on a lengthy cruise of the Greek islands in 1994 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/obituaries/frank-schreider-70-who-wrote-of-world-travels-dies-on-boat.html" title="">he died of a heart attack at the age of 79 aboard his sloop</a>.</p><p>Ms. Schreider joined the National Park Service as a museum designer. She created exhibitions within the Statue of Liberty for the United States bicentennial in 1976 and at Yellowstone National Park.</p><p>Throughout her life, she painted portraits and landscapes in oil, inspired by her travels, which were shown in several solo exhibitions. She was included in the book “Women Photographers at National Geographic” (2000).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“She was voracious to discover the world and the beauty,” Ms. Armstrong, her niece, said in an interview, adding that she always had her drawing supplies close at hand. “She could literally with 10 swipes of the pencil get the whole drawing. She could capture the moments right as they were moving through villages.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frank and Helen Schreider in India in their younger days.

They married in 1947 while they were still undergraduates.</p><p>She is survived by a brother, Donald B. Armstrong, and her partner of 25 years, John Ryan, a retired professor of geography at the University of Winnipeg. A second marriage, to Russ Hendrickson, ended in divorce in 1983.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The Schreiders’ plans for a delayed honeymoon road trip grew more and more ambitious, until Mr. Schreider suggested driving all the way from the Arctic Circle to the tip of South America.</p><p>Ms. Schreider agreed, and the couple departed from Circle, Alaska, in the treeless tundra, on June 21, 1954. Along for the journey was their German shepherd, Dinah.</p><p>Because the Pan-American Highway had not yet been completed over some mountain ranges in Central America, the Schreiders rebuilt an amphibious Ford jeep that had been manufactured during World War II, which Mr. Schreider described as a “bathtub with wheels,” to take to the sea.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Schreiders with their German shepherd, Dinah, on board La Tortuga in Argentina. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Helen and Frank Schreider, via Anna Darrah</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The ungainly La Tortuga first entered the Pacific Ocean in Costa Rica in 10-foot surf, a terrifying experience for the couple that nearly ended their journey.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“La Tortuga reared like a horse, Helen grabbed for the dash, Dinah was thrown to the back, and I held grimly to the wheel,” Mr. Schreider wrote in “20,000 Miles South.”</p><p>The jeep later passed through locks of the Panama Canal to the Caribbean, where the Schreiders steered south, provisioned with a month’s supply of Army C-rations. They island-hopped for 250 miles, coming ashore onto pristine beaches where children covered La Tortuga in flowers.</p><p>After 30 seagoing days, they landed in Turbo, Colombia, where a customs official asked, “Is it a boat or a car?”</p><p>“It’s both,” Mr. Schreider replied.</p><p>At the southernmost tip of the continent, there was a final amphibious crossing in a 10-knot current of the Strait of Magellan to Tierra del Fuego, where they completed their journey on Jan. 23, 1956.</p><p>Back home in the United States, Ms. Schreider told a newspaper reporter that she had been “game for anything.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
