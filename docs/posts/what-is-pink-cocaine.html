Often, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00952990.2023.2207716" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pink cocaine includes ketamine</a>, a dissociative anesthetic with hallucinogenic effects, and other drugs like Ecstasy, methamphetamine, opioids and psychoactive substances such as bath salts.</p><p>“This concoction is usually very cheap, which attracts people to use it,” said Dr. Linda Cottler, an epidemiologist who studies substance abuse at the University of Florida.</p><p>The term “pink cocaine” is itself a misnomer, as the cocktail rarely contains cocaine, said Joseph Palamar, an associate professor at New York University Langone Health who researches party drugs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Rather, the name likely comes from the fact that pink cocaine is sold in powder form and dyed pink with food coloring.</p><p>Also known as tusi, pink cocaine originated in Colombia and was named after the synthetic compound “2C-B,” a quasi psychedelic that was first synthesized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/dr-ecstasy.html" title="">by the drug pioneer Alexander Shulgin</a>, but it rarely contains that substance either, experts said.</p><p>“These underground chemists — they try to come up with something they think people will like,” said Dr. David E. Nichols, a pharmacologist at Purdue University who studies hallucinogens. “God know what the effects will be.”</p><p>The drug has had a growing presence in the U.S. In September, <a href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2024/09/13/new-jersey-man-arrested-sales-eight-guns-cocaine-and-pink-cocaine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Drug Enforcement Administration said that the distribution</a> of pink cocaine was increasing, and that it was mostly sold online and through social media. <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/NDTA_2024.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a national assessment</a> of drug threats this year, the agency also said that the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico was increasingly manufacturing and trafficking the drug cocktail.</p><p>“Ketamine is going to dethrone Ecstasy very soon, and tusi is really going to bump it up,” Dr. Palamar said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Bridget G. Brennan, the special narcotics prosecutor in New York City, said that the concoction causes amnesia and has been seen in date rape cases.</p><p>“It could be mixed with anything,” Ms. Brennan said. “It can put people into a ‘K-hole,’ where they feel like they’re in a blank space, like they are disassociated from their body, they’re disassociated from their brain, they don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p>In recent months, the concoction has been linked to two high-profile arrests.</p><p>When the embattled music mogul Sean Combs was arrested in September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html" title="">law enforcement found pink powder</a> in his New York hotel room, according to a prosecutor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/arts/music/diddy-sean-combs-rodney-jones-dismiss.html" title="">A lawsuit filed</a> by a music producer, Rodney Jones Jr., alleging sexual misconduct said that pink cocaine was often on hand during Mr. Combs’s travels.</p><p>Maecee Marie Lathers, an Instagram influencer, told police that she had taken pink cocaine before she crashed her car into two other vehicles that killed two people in Miami in August. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqlbKHfgILw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Lathers is facing several charges</a>, including two counts of driving under the influence manslaughter.</p><p>Dr. Cottler now considers pink cocaine among the most dangerous club drugs, because dealers and users rarely know what’s in any given batch.</p><p>“All you need is one drug dealer to mix fentanyl into their tusi batch,” Dr. Palamar said. “They have the ability to poison a bunch of people.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
