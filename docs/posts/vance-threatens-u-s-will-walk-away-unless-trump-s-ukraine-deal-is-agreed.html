    <h1>Vance Threatens U.S. Will ‘Walk Away’ Unless Trump’s Ukraine Deal Is Agreed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>European-led peace talks set for Wednesday in London were downgraded when Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would no longer attend. His decision to pull out prompted Britain’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, to decide that he, too, would not attend — though Mr. Lammy met separately with Ukraine’s foreign minister in London.</p><p>Lower-level diplomats from Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States still gathered for technical talks, according to the officials from Britain and France. But the sudden downgrading of what was meant to be a significant diplomatic gathering raised questions about efforts to negotiate a cease-fire.</p><p>Those still meeting are expected to discuss details of the Trump administration’s proposed peace plan, which calls on Ukraine to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea — a move that much of the international community deemed illegal — and accept that its NATO aspirations will go unmet.</p><p>Mr. Vance told reporters in India that under the American proposal, “we’re going to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.”</p><p>“The current lines, or somewhere close to them, is where you’re ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict,” he added. “Now, of course, that means the Ukrainians and the Russians are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own.”</p><p>Ségolène Le Stradic<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris and <!-- -->Steven Erlanger<!-- --> contributed from Brussels.</p></div></div>
