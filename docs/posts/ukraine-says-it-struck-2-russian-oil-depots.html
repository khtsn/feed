The governor of the region, Vasily Golubev, reported a <a href="https://t.me/golubev_vu/1507" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fire at an oil depot</a> and said that four drones had been shot down.</p><p>Ukraine also struck an oil depot in Russia’s Kirov region, which is roughly 800 miles from the Ukrainian border, northeast of Moscow; and an artillery depot in Voronezh region, which borders Ukraine, the military’s general staff said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Russian governor of the Kirov region, Aleksandr Sokolov, said in a post on Telegram that an <a href="https://t.me/aleksandrsokolov43/4749" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oil facility</a> there had been set on fire on Wednesday. Two drones were shot down, while three others crashed, he said. The governor of the Voronezh region, Aleksandr Gusev, also reported a <a href="https://t.me/gusev_36/2693" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drone attack</a>, but said in a post on Telegram that no damage was caused.</p><p>The claims could be independently confirmed.</p><p>For months, Ukraine has conducted attacks using exploding drones against Russian infrastructure, in particular oil facilities, hoping to slow an offensive by Moscow’s forces. Russia has nevertheless <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk-incursion-pokrovsk.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">advanced toward the city of Pokrovsk</a>, which is an important transport and logistics hub in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>In Kyiv, explosions from a Russian drone attack rattled buildings overnight, the third time this week that Moscow had launched an aerial attack against the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine’s Air Force said it had shot down 60 drones and two missiles, but the attack was smaller than on Monday, when strikes hit many regions.</p><p>Moscow’s aerial campaign, which has frequently targeted Ukraine’s power grid, aims to cripple the country’s ability to stave off Russia’s full-scale invasion and deepen the hardships of war for Ukrainian civilians. </p><p>But the government in Kyiv has attempted a riposte with its own series of attacks, including the surprise offensive over the border into Russia’s Kursk region that began earlier this month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>That incursion has been accompanied by calls from Ukrainian officials for its allies to ease restrictions on the use of the missiles they have given to Kyiv that prohibit striking deep inside Russia with them.</p><p>A member of Ukraine’s Parliament said in June that the armed forces had used a rocket system supplied by the United States to hit a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-russia-western-weapons.html" title="">military facility</a> in Russia’s Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine.</p><p>The country also used American-supplied <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/ukraine-incursion-russia-kursk.html" title="">munitions and vehicles</a> in its Kursk incursion. Pentagon and State Department officials have said that use of American-supplied weapons and munitions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/ukraine-incursion-russia-kursk.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">did not violate U.S. policy</a>.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky late on Wednesday urged the country’s allies from NATO to give his country more weapons and greater latitude to use them against Russia itself. True unity with NATO partners, he said in a speech overnight, would mean permission to do long-range strikes.</p><p>“We continue to insist that their determination now — lifting the restrictions on long-range strikes for Ukraine now — will help us to end the war as soon as possible,” he said. Earlier this week, the defense minister, Rustem Umerov, said Ukraine wanted to be able to strike logistics points and military airfields.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Russia has threatened a grave response to any attacks on its soil with Western weapons. Some of Ukraine’s allies have argued that their use risked a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, a nuclear-armed nation. So far that grave response has not materialized.</p><p>Earlier this summer, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-weapons.html" title="">gave permission</a> for Ukraine to conduct limited strikes inside Russia with American-made weapons — but only in Russian territory near northeastern Ukraine and for defensive purposes.</p><p>A wide range of significant targets that underpin Moscow’s campaign could be within reach of Ukraine’s longer-range weapons, the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said in a <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent report</a>.</p><p>Diplomatic outreach has been a critical component of the Ukrainian government’s response to Russia’s invasion and on Wednesday, Mr. Zelensky spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky joined other international leaders in expressing strong support for Israel after a deadly attack led by Hamas on Oct. 7, but the two men had not spoken for nearly a year, according to a report by Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>They discussed the situation in the Middle East and the recent Russian attacks on Ukraine as well as other topics, the report said. Mr. Netanyahu also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=8202331406501036&amp;id=100001727742730&amp;rdid=XlaEIgOYXcyTPvVj" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed support</a> for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, according to Serhiy Nikiforov, Mr. Zelensky’s spokesman.</p><p>The government in Kyiv has also attempted to corral diplomatic support for its own peace plan, which would involve a complete Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. This week, Mr. Zelensky said he planned to present a “plan for Ukraine’s victory” to President Biden in September.</p><p>Ukraine’s incursion into the Kursk region is part of the plan, along with further financial measures to force Moscow to end the war, Mr. Zelensky said. He gave few other details.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/matthew-mpoke-bigg">More about Matthew Mpoke Bigg</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
