They said the flight could leave as soon as Wednesday.</p><p>The denials were issued by both the internationally recognized government in the capital, Tripoli, which controls western Libya, and by the authorities in eastern Libya, under the control of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/world/middleeast/libya-flood-aid-khalifa-hifter.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">warlord Khalifa Hifter</a>.</p><p>The Tripoli-based government issued a statement denying “any agreement or coordination” over the entry of deported migrants, and stressed its “rejection of the use of Libyan territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But in an apparent reference to Mr. Hifter’s forces, the Tripoli government’s statement noted that some “parallel entities” might have struck a deal with Washington — an apparent reference to some authority in eastern Libya.</p><p>If that were the case, the Tripoli government insisted that such agreements “do not represent the Libyan state and are not legally or politically binding.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Khalifa Hifter, the warlord whose government controls eastern Libya.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thanassis Stavrakis/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>On Wednesday, a statement from the foreign ministry of Mr. Hifter’s administration in the east said that it, too, “firmly rejects the existence of any agreements or understandings concerning the resettlement of migrants of any nationality whether African, European, American or otherwise.”</p><p>Washington has formal relations only with the Tripoli government. But Mr. Hifter’s son, Saddam, who is also the deputy general commander of the military of eastern Libya, was in Washington last week.
