But a huge unknown remains: whether former Vice President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/kamala-harris-california-governor.html" title="">Kamala Harris will jump in</a>.</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom cannot run for re-election because state law limits governors to two terms. Most of the Democrats who have entered the open race so far are current or former state officials who have experience in the statehouse but are little known to the public. Voters are much more familiar with Ms. Porter, a law professor who served six years in Congress representing Orange County, polls <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/97b1p0sq" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">show</a>.</p><p>Ms. Porter announced her campaign on Tuesday by releasing a video that cast herself as someone who would fight to counter President Trump’s agenda and bring a fresh lens to the State Capitol, where she has never served in an elected office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After losing the presidential election in November, Ms. Harris returned home to Los Angeles and has contemplated a run for California governor. Ms. Porter will drop out of the race if Ms. Harris runs, a spokesman confirmed.</p><p>Ms. Porter observed in December that Ms. Harris would have “a near field-clearing effect on the Democratic side” of the race.</p><p>Other Democrats who have announced campaigns for California governor include Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor and a longtime friend of Ms. Harris; Antonio Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles; Betty Yee, a former state controller; Toni Atkins, a former state legislative leader; and Tony Thurmond, the state schools superintendent. Chad Bianco, the Riverside County sheriff, is the most prominent Republican to enter the race so far.</p><p>Ms. Porter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/us/katie-porter-california-senate-primary.html" title="">lost</a> a bid last year for the Senate seat previously held by Dianne Feinstein, the longtime senator who died in 2023. She finished third in the state’s open primary, in which the top two candidates advance regardless of party registration.</p><p>Ms. Porter was second in some early polls, indicating that she had a chance to face off in the general election against Adam Schiff, then a fellow Democratic House member who consistently led in surveys. But the closing months of the primary featured heavy spending by Mr. Schiff and his allies, who focused their ads on Steve Garvey, a Republican and a former baseball star who had never held office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The campaign spots promoted Mr. Garvey as a Trump backer and helped to coalesce conservative votes behind him, and he finished in second place ahead of Ms. Porter.</p><p>After the race, Ms. Porter <a href="https://x.com/katieporteroc/status/1765513523050791023?s=46&amp;t=aJuMTh-NOnrguaqKZIo-Gg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decried</a> “an onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election,” referring to backers of Mr. Schiff, who went on to win the general election in a landslide and now represents California in the Senate. Critics in her own party said that she had been wrong to use language that they said echoed Mr. Trump and sowed doubt around the integrity of the state’s election system.</p><p>She later said she <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-19/porter-apologies-for-saying-senate-primary-was-rigged" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regretted</a> using the word “rig” but maintained her larger point — that the race had been influenced by tech investors and cryptocurrency executives who spent $10 million on advertising that worked against her. </p><p>Ms. Porter’s Senate campaign highlighted her experience as a single mother raising three children in an expensive state. She coupled populist economic messages with campaign ads that showed home-cooked meals packaged in the fridge, and she published a book, “I Swear: Politics Is Messier Than My Minivan.”</p><p>Similar themes run through the three-minute video that Ms. Porter released to announce her campaign for governor. It shows her inside the kitchen of her suburban home, talking to the camera about the “out of control” costs of groceries, health care and housing and sitting beside her daughter, who is doing homework.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“As governor, I won’t ever back down when Trump hurts Californians, whether it’s holding up disaster relief, attacking our rights and our communities, or screwing over working families to benefit himself and his cronies,” Ms. Porter said in the video.</p><p>Ms. Porter first ran for Congress in 2018 and flipped a Republican-held seat, which was part of the so-called “blue wave” in which Democrats regained control of the House. She won re-election twice before she ran in last year’s Senate race. She returned to teaching law school at the University of California, Irvine, this year.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
