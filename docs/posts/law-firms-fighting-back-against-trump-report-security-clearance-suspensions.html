A number of firms cut deals with Mr. Trump in order to avoid becoming subject to such directives.</p><p>The handful of firms that did not make deals — and were then singled out in orders that accused them of working against the country’s national interest — sued, arguing that the orders amount to blatantly illegal retaliation for representing clients and employing lawyers the president opposes politically.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In at least one instance, a federal judge has agreed, bypassing a trial and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-law-firms.html" title="">permanently blocking the government</a> from enforcing the terms of an order targeting the firm Perkins Coie. In the cases involving WilmerHale and Jenner &amp; Block, judges have temporarily halted the Trump administration from implementing the orders aimed at them while litigation plays out.</p><p>Even so, Paul Clement, a lawyer for WilmerHale, said in a filing that two of its lawyers had received letters informing them that their security clearances had been suspended.</p><p>“This development underscores that the executive branch stands ready and willing to implement the executive order absent judicial intervention,” Mr. Clement wrote in a notice dated May 9.</p><p>A lawyer for Jenner &amp; Block <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278932/gov.uscourts.dcd.278932.133.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a similar notice</a> dated May 14 indicating that it had just learned one of its attorneys had their clearance suspended, as well.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s executive orders directed agencies to essentially exile the firms from any work that runs through the federal government, such as by barring their attorneys from entering federal buildings, blacklisting them from federal contracts and taking away any security clearances held by their staff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As justification, the orders cited the fact that both firms had employed top members of the special unit that investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the question of whether Mr. Trump had worked to obstruct that investigation. They specifically named Robert S. Mueller III and Andrew Weissmann, who returned to those firms in the years after the investigation wound down. Both left in 2021, as lawyers for the firms have noted.</p><p>Both firms have asked the respective judges in their cases to skip past a trial and decide the relatively straightforward question of whether Mr. Trump’s orders are legal and should be allowed to stand.</p><p>Their cases are essentially identical in nature to those brought by other firms that found themselves in a similar position, such as Perkins Coie and Susman Godfrey. When Perkins Coie received its final ruling from a judge earlier this month, the answer to whether the president’s order was lawful was an emphatic no.</p><p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.184.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruling</a>, from Judge Beryl A.
