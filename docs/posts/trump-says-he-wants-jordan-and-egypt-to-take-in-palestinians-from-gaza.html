    <h1>Trump Says He Wants Jordan and Egypt to Take in Palestinians From Gaza</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Trump said he told King Abdullah II of Jordan during a phone call Saturday that he would like Jordan and Egypt to take in more Palestinians from Gaza, an idea that is likely to reignite debate about the future of nearly two million Palestinians.</p><p>“I said to him, ‘I’d love for you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess,’” Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One. He added that he would also like Egypt to take in more Palestinians and that he would speak to the country’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, on Sunday.</p><p>Mr. Trump made the remarks on an evening flight after a rally in Las Vegas; it is unclear whether they signal a change in U.S. policy toward Palestinians.</p><p>Tens of thousands of Palestinians have started <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-returning-home-after-war.html" title="">returning</a> to their homes as the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel enters a second week. It is only the second <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/middleeast/gaza-ceasefire-what-we-know.html" title="">pause in fighting</a> between the two since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas led an attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 Israelis. Since then, Israel’s military has killed at least 46,000 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/health/gaza-death-toll.html" title="">Palestinians</a>, according to Gazan health officials who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. It has also destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in Gaza and killed many of Hamas’s leaders.</p></div></div>
