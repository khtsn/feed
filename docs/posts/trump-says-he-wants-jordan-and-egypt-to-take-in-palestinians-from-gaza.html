Speaking in the Oval Office while signing executive orders, Mr. Trump said he wanted Jordan and Egypt to take in the Palestinians.</p><div><p>“They have no alternative right now” but to leave, Mr. Trump said of Gazans. “I mean, they’re there because they have no alternative. What do they have? It is a big pile of rubble right now.” He added: “I don’t know how they could want to stay. It’s a demolition site. It’s a pure demolition site.”</p><p>Mr. Trump seemed to indicate that he wanted to find a permanent new homeland for the Palestinians rather than reconstruct Gaza. “If we could find the right piece of land, or numerous pieces of land, and build them some really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that’s for sure,” he said. “I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza.”</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>While the president framed the matter as a humanitarian imperative, the notion of clearing Palestinians out of Gaza is an explosive one in a region that has endured generations of warfare over questions of homelands and forced migration. Neither Egypt nor Jordan want large numbers of Palestinians, given the burden and fears of instability, nor is it clear that Gazans would willingly abandon the enclave they have spent years defending, even with the destruction.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Netanyahu will be his first in-person meeting with another world leader since returning to power two weeks ago.The two are expected to discuss negotiations for the second phase of the fragile cease-fire with Hamas, Iran’s efforts to build a nuclear weapon, new arms shipments and hopes for a deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The meeting, which is part of a multiday visit to Washington by Mr. Netanyahu, is meant to demonstrate the close ties between the two leaders after more than a year of war between Israel and Hamas severely strained the relationship between the Israeli leader and President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu had forged a close partnership during the president’s first term but fell out toward the end of the president’s first term over a number of issues, including the Israeli leader’s willingness to congratulate Mr. Biden on his victory in the 2020 election that Mr. Trump to this day insists he won. Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu have since sought to smooth over their rift and the president told reporters last weekend that he was looking forward to the meeting.</p><p>“The discussions on the Middle East with Israel and various and sundry other countries are progressing,” the president said, adding that Mr. Netanyahu would be “coming on Tuesday, and I think we have some very big meetings scheduled.”</p><p>But Mr. Netanyahu will be going into his meeting at odds with Mr. Trump on several key issues, according to analysts. Those are likely to include the questions of how to confront Iran’s nuclear ambitions and how quickly to end the war in Gaza.</p><p>The Trump administration has made clear that it wants to see all of the hostages held by Hamas returned and then move on to a grand bargain involving Saudi Arabia that formalizes relations with Israel. All of that hinges on an end to fighting in the Palestinian enclave.</p><p>Advisers to Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday morning that the president and Mr. Netanyahu were united behind the idea that Hamas should not be allowed to remain in power at the end of a permanent cease-fire, saying that would not be “an outcome that any of us will tolerate.”</p><p>“If you had damage that was one-hundreth of what I saw in Gaza,” said Steve Witkoff, the president’s Middle East negotiator, “nobody would be allowed to go back to their homes. That’s how dangerous it is. There’s 30,000 unexploded munitions. It is buildings that could tip over at any moment. There’s no utilities.”</p><p>Mike Waltz, the president’s national security adviser, said Mr. Trump continued to believe that Gaza would not be habitable for as long as 15 years because of the destruction from the war. The president has suggested that Palestinians from Gaza be relocated to Jordan and Egypt, something that the leaders of the two countries have publicly rejected.</p><p>“President Trump is absolutely engaged on the issue,” Mr. Waltz told reporters on Tuesday afternoon before Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu met. “And I think with his leadership, we’ll be able to pull some solutions together. And of course, we have Prime Minister Netanyahu here today. So the president, President Trump, is driving, I think, practical, common-sense solutions to what is admittedly a very, very difficult situation.”</p><p>With Mr. Netanyahu’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-cease-fire.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">right-wing government in jeopardy</a> if the war ends with Hamas still in control in Gaza, and with no other plan for the area in place, analysts expect the Israeli prime minister to try to delay moving to the next stage of the deal, which calls for a permanent cease-fire.</p><p>“Netanyahu made this salami deal,” said Shira Efron, the senior director of policy research at the Israel Policy Forum, a New York-based research group, referring to the three-phased agreement with Hamas. “He’s always playing for time and kicking the can down the road — something he is an expert in. Trump wants to cut to the chase and end the war.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="44" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvN2E0Yjc0ODUtMjIzMy01MmYyLWIwYTAtYTZlYzc4YjI5MDBi"><div id="7a4b7485-2233-52f2-b0a0-a6ec78b2900b" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#7a4b7485-2233-52f2-b0a0-a6ec78b2900b"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/farnaz-fassihi"><img alt="Farnaz Fassihi" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/world/farnaz-fassahi/farnaz-fassahi-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-04T20:55:00.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 4, 2025, 3:55 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>President Trump signed an executive order that for the first time called for a review of the United States’s funding of the United Nations, casting a cloud over the financial future of the U.N.

Still, they are toiling to find ways of showing voters that they are resisting the new administration, including by speaking out frequently to denounce the president’s moves, posting videos on social media and orchestrating legislative actions that are all but certain to fail but aim to stoke public outrage.</p><div><p>The two Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, on Tuesday announced their party’s first joint legislative maneuver to counter an unrestrained Trump Administration: a bill that would prevent unauthorized access to the Treasury Department’s secure payments system, which houses sensitive data such as Americans’ Social Security numbers and direct deposit information.</p><p>The legislation, titled the “Stop the Steal Act,” is all but certain to be blocked given that Republicans have shown little interest in challenging Mr. Trump or resisting his attempts to circumvent the legislative branch to impose his will.</p><p>“They are raiding the government, attempting to steal taxpayer money,” Mr. Jeffries said at a news conference Tuesday, referring to congressional Republicans. “That’s what the situation at the Treasury Department is all about.”</p><p>The bill was part of a 10-pronged resistance plan that Mr. Jeffries announced on Monday. Democrats announced it days after Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, gave Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency access to the payment system, which handles trillions of dollars in Social Security payments, tax refunds, grants and myriad other federal disbursements.</p><p>“We must protect people’s Social Security payments, their Medicare payments, their tax refunds from any possible tampering by DOGE or any other unauthorized entity,” Mr. Schumer said Tuesday in a speech on the Senate floor. “Mr. Musk, this isn’t a tech startup. These are public institutions.”</p><p>The backlash to DOGE’s access to the Treasury payment system follows last week’s onslaught of news conferences — sometimes two in one day — that Mr. Schumer hosted to condemn Mr. Trump’s attempts to upend the federal bureaucracy, in particular the blanket order to freeze all federal loans and grants. When the Trump Administration reversed course and rescinded the order, Democrats took credit and hailed the reversal as proof that they and their voters had the power to influence Mr. Trump.</p><p>Several congressional Democrats on Monday orchestrated a protest outside the U.S. Agency for International Development headquarters after the administration told employees not to show up for work. When they tried to enter the building, they were denied entry and told that Mr. Musk’s orders were to keep the building locked. Lawmakers announced plans for a protest outside the Treasury Department later Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Members are also organizing protests on the Senate floor.</p><p>Republicans on Monday blocked a measure from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, that would have reaffirmed that U.S.A.I.D. — which Mr. Musk said he intended to dismantle at Mr. Trump’s behest — was an independent agency and declared that it must remain so to safeguard the country’s national security interests.</p><p>Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico are trying to force a vote on a measure that would terminate Mr. Trump’s national energy emergency, which they argue is just a ruse to boost oil company profits.</p><p>And two Democratic senators, Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, have pledged to vote against Mr. Trump nominees to protest, among other actions, the administration’s attempts to unilaterally defund and shutter several independent federal agencies, including U.S.A.I.D. and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p>Mr. Schatz said he had placed a “blanket hold” on Mr. Trump’s nominees to the State Department until and unless U.S.A.I.D. was reopened as an independent agency. Ms. Blunt Rochester said she would oppose all cabinet level nominees.</p><p>“This chaos and confusion does not give me confidence that any of them will do their part to uphold the rule of law,” she said of Mr. Trump’s nominees. “The recklessness on display early in this administration has already proven to be incredibly harmful to communities in Delaware, across our nation, and around the world.”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="39" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzUyZjhiYzI0LTNiNDMtNTZkZi05MTdhLTM5YzMxY2NiZWU1OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#trump-sovereign-wealth-fund" data-source-id="100000009969064"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maureen-farrell"><img alt="Maureen Farrell" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/12/reader-center/author-maureen-farrell/author-maureen-farrell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/12/reader-center/author-maureen-farrell/author-maureen-farrell-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/12/reader-center/author-maureen-farrell/author-maureen-farrell-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-04T20:07:28.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 4, 2025, 3:07 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump on Monday signed an executive order to plan for the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>While he was campaigning last fall, President Trump bemoaned the lack of a U.S.-backed investment fund and promised to create one.</p><p>“Other countries have wealth funds,” he said. “We have nothing.”</p><div><p>On Monday, he took the first step. He issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/a-plan-for-establishing-a-united-states-sovereign-wealth-fund/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> that announced the planning for an investment vehicle or a sovereign wealth fund, which would be financed by the United States government.</p><p>Sovereign wealth funds are investment funds owned by an individual state or government typically created from budget surpluses or revenues from oil or other commodities. These funds may indirectly finance domestic industries as well as a wide range of other investments.</p><p>The order calls for the secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, and the secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, to report back with a plan in 90 days. In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Bessent said that the government would create this fund in the next 12 months.</p><p>The president and his associates can take their plan only so far. The establishment of a sovereign-wealth fund, which would use taxpayer dollars or other government funds, is likely to require an act of Congress.</p><p>It’s unclear how exactly the U.S. government would come up with the money to put into it. While many other countries operate funds that invest domestically and internationally, many of them, particularly those in the Middle East, have significant proceeds from natural resources like oil or gas to invest. Other countries, including Singapore, use their budget surpluses.</p><p>By contrast, the U.S. government doesn’t have any significant natural resource revenue and <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/#:~:text=The%20opposite%20of%20a%20budget,years%2C%20most%20recently%20in%202001." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been operating</a> under an annual budget deficit for more than two decades. Despite a flurry of announcements on tariffs in recent days, neither Mr. Trump, Mr. Bessent nor Mr. Lutnick mentioned the proceeds of these tariffs as a source of funding.</p><p>In September during a speech at the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Trump pointed to “money that will be taken in through tariffs” as one key source of funding, along with “other intelligent things.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-orders-plan-for-a-united-states-sovereign-wealth-fund/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> accompanying the order, Mr. Trump’s team cited $5.7 trillion in assets held by the federal government and added that the government holds even more “indirectly, including through natural resource reserves.”</p><p>According to the Treasury Department’s website, as of 2023, the <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/where-we-are-now.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">government had</a> $5.3 trillion. Of that, the United States held roughly $922.2 billion in cash, which is mostly used to run its operations. It held $423 billion in so-called inventory, most of it from the Department of Defense, which includes stockpiles of commodities or equipment like ammunition and tactical missiles. It had $1.7 trillion in outstanding loans made by government agencies like the Department of Education and the Small Business Association; and another $1.2 trillion in assets like land, buildings, structures, facilities and software.</p><p>It’s unclear how those trillions of dollars could flow into a sovereign wealth fund. The U.S. government has relied on ever larger amounts of borrowed money and is projected to run budget deficits long into the future.</p><p>Mr. Lutnick speculated that the government could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/business/media/tiktok-sale-who-could-buy.html" title="">take stakes in TikTok</a> or private companies it works with. He cited government funding for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/politics/moderna-vaccine-patent-nih.html" title="">Covid-19 vaccines</a> as an example. “If we are going to buy two billion Covid vaccines, maybe we should have some warrants and some equity in these companies,” Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092925/#:~:text=Sovereign%20wealth%20funds%20(SWFs)%20have,particularly%20in%20private%20equity%20funding." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 100 sovereign wealth funds</a> around the world with combined assets valued at over $10 trillion.

Senator Todd Young of Indiana had also asked tough questions in the confirmation hearing but <a href="https://x.com/sentoddyoung/status/1886799486640386197?s=46" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced his support for Ms. Gabbard in a social media post</a> before the vote.</p><p>As he walked into the committee room, Mr. Young said he had spoken to Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance about the vote. He said the written assurances Ms. Gabbard had given him were critical to winning him over.</p><p>“I’ve done my work,” Mr. Young said. “I’ve done my vetting.”</p><p>Ms. Collins announced Monday that she would support Ms. Gabbard, saying she shared her vision of shrinking the size of the office and returning it to its original role of coordinating among the spy agencies. That remains the office’s primary role, but it also has analysts and intelligence managers who do their own analytic work.</p><p>Over the weekend, Ms. Gabbard also got support from Elon Musk, who called Mr. Young a “deep state puppet” on his social media platform, X. Mr. Musk deleted the post shortly afterward and wrote that he had spoken to Mr. Young. “I stand corrected,” Mr. Musk wrote. “Senator Young will be a great ally in restoring power to the people from the vast, unelected bureaucracy.”</p><p>Before the vote, Mr. Young confirmed that he had spoken with Mr. Musk but said that they had not discussed Ms. Gabbard. He said he had spoken to Mr. Trump about the vote, but that the president did not pressure him and told him to vote his conscience.</p><p>“I said, ‘How important is this to you, Mr. President?’” Mr. Young recounted. “He said it’s important. But he said, ‘You know what, Todd, we’re going to work together on all kinds of other things to make America great again.’ And I told him I need reassurances. And those were delivered.”</p><p>Ms. Gabbard assured Mr. Young, <a href="https://x.com/SenToddYoung/status/1886799486640386197" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a letter he posted on social media,</a> that she would hold accountable officials who make unauthorized disclosures of classified material. She also pledged not to make a recommendation about the “legal standing” of Edward Snowden, an intelligence contractor who released classified documents about American surveillance programs in 2013.</p><p>Some in Congress had thought that Ms. Gabbard’s nomination would be the trickiest of Mr. Trump’s choices, given her unorthodox views and her past service as a Democratic member of the House, where she represented Hawaii.</p><p>But the stakes were lower than those for other nominees. The director of national intelligence oversees other spy agencies and sets broad priorities, but the job is not as powerful as that of the director of central intelligence. That leader runs covert actions and oversees intelligence stations around the world.</p><p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s most important job, arguably, is overseeing the President’s Daily Brief, an intelligence summary assembled each morning. Many Republicans believe that Mr. Trump deserves to have someone he trusts in that position.</p><p>Even before her tense hearing, Ms. Gabbard earned the support of Senator Tom Cotton, who is an Arkansas Republican and the committee’s chairman. And afterward, she secured the support of Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who is an influential member of the caucus.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard had one of the most difficult confirmation hearings of any of Mr. Trump’s nominees. She dodged a series of questions that Republican lawmakers meant to be softballs, or took offense at them, giving Democrats a chance to pile on in contentious exchanges that highlighted her unorthodox views.</p><p>Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, asked what he later said he thought would be an easy question: Was Edward Snowden a traitor? But she declined to answer directly, giving Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, an opening to push hard.</p><p><strong>“</strong>Is Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America?” Mr. Bennet asked in a thunderous voice. “That is not a hard question to answer.”</p><p>After the hearing, Senator John Curtis, Republican of Utah, said he still had questions. “Some of her responses, and nonresponses, created more confusion than clarity and only deepened my concerns about her judgment,” he told reporters.</p><p>But Mr. Curtis is not on the Intelligence Committee, whose Republican members fell into line and backed her nomination.</p><p>The most tense exchanges came over Ms. Gabbard’s support for Mr. Snowden, who said his disclosures revealed illegal government efforts to spy on Americans.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard came into the hearing intent on distancing herself from Mr. Snowden. But she repeatedly balked when Republicans gently, and Democrats forcefully, tried to get her to call Mr. Snowden a traitor.</p><p>She said that Mr. Snowden’s actions were illegal but that they had brought to light surveillance programs that wrongly collected information about Americans.</p><p>“The fact is, he also, even as he broke the law, released information that exposed egregious, illegal and unconstitutional programs that are happening within our government,” Ms. Gabbard said of Mr. Snowden, who fled the United States and now lives in Russia.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Trump have similar foreign policy views on terrorism, Russia, long military engagements and other matters. But her sympathetic stance toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and her defense of the government of the former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad gave Republicans pause.</p><p>Still, the discussions about Mr. Snowden’s disclosures were the most tense in her confirmation hearing.</p><p>In a social media post before the hearing, Mr. Snowden <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1884935491423777093" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged</a> Ms. Gabbard <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1884935491423777093" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to denounce her past support for him</a>. But she did not. He also told the lawmakers to <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1885025260971712773" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“move on,”</a> arguing that courts had taken Ms. Gabbard’s side and that the National Security Agency’s actions he exposed were illegal.</p><p>In 2013, Mr. Snowden, then a contractor for the N.S.A. in Hawaii, gained access to a trove of classified material. His most significant disclosure was the bulk data collection of Americans’ phone metadata.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="36" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMDU0ZjY0NDctZmUwNC01ZTAwLTkzYjQtMzA2Y2JiZWY5N2I3"><div id="054f6447-fe04-5e00-93b4-306cbbef97b7" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#054f6447-fe04-5e00-93b4-306cbbef97b7"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robert-jimison"><img alt="Robert Jimison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-04T19:34:53.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 4, 2025, 2:34 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 9 to 8 to advance Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination to be director of national intelligence to the full Senate.

That group, the lawsuits estimated, could number as many as 6,000 agents.</p><div><p>The lawsuits said that the agents believed the administration intended to reveal their identities, exposing the agents and their families to profound danger. They seek court orders prohibiting the executive branch from releasing the names.</p><p>The Trump administration has not said it intends to release the identities of the law enforcement officials, but its demand for names of people who worked on the cases has stoked the belief that it may move to fire them en masse. At the Justice Department, prosecutors who have worked on cases involving President Trump or the Jan. 6 rioters have been dismissed.

Greenland also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/greenland-minerals-mining.html" title="">has enormous reserves</a> of rare elements and other minerals used to make advanced technology.</p><p>“We need it for national security,” the president has said.</p><p>Greenland has long been tied to Denmark, first as a colony and then as a semiautonomous territory. Since 2009, it has had the right to declare independence after a referendum, but it still relies on Denmark for its defense, security and other international affairs.</p><p>Greenland’s mostly Inuit population has increasingly chafed against Copenhagen’s oversight.

Greenland previously did not limit or prohibit such contributions, according to the proposal.</p><p>The proposal notes that foreign powers have tried to influence other democratic elections around the world in recent years. The authors specifically pointed to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-campaign-donation.html" title="">enormous amount</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/politics/dark-money-presidential-campaign.html" title="">private political donations</a> in the United States.</p><p>“The initiative is obviously urgent,” said Ulrik Pram Gad, a researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies.</p><p>He said donations had not previously influenced Greenland’s politics and called the law “primarily a preventive measure.”</p><p>Greenland is also trying to ward against foreign interests by limiting real estate purchases.</p><p>On Monday, lawmakers <a href="https://naalakkersuisut.gl/Nyheder/2025/02/0302_fast_ejendom?sc_lang=da" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved new regulations</a> that would restrict land purchases to Danish citizens or people who have been permanent residents of Greenland for at least two years. The rules are expected to take effect later this year.</p><p>Greenland has about 56,000 residents and is mostly covered in ice. It is opening up to the world — it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/world/europe/greenland-trump-business.html" title="">has said that it is ready for business</a> and recently opened a new <a href="https://visitgreenland.com/articles/new-flight-schedule-makes-greenland-more-accessible/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">international airport</a><strong> </strong>— but its tourism infrastructure is sparse.</p><p>Foreign campaign contributions — even those seen as tiny by American standards — could drastically change Greenland’s political structure: Parties have been mostly financed by public subsidies, while private contributions have “constituted an insignificant part” of its political financing, the proposal read.</p><p>“The perspectives of this potential threat are alarming,” it read. “Donations that would be modest on an international scale would be colossal in a Greenlandic election campaign.”</p><p>Political parties will no longer be allowed to receive foreign or anonymous contributions. Neither will local and youth branches of parties, lawmakers, aides and candidates.</p><p>The new law will also cap the amount of private political donations. A political party can receive only about $28,000 in private donations a year. Individual donors can only give about $2,800. The law also strengthens and broadens disclosure requirements, among other considerations.</p><p>“Disproportionately large private donations could weaken public confidence in the integrity of political processes,” the proposal read.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="29" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzY4MmRjYjY5LWE4MTctNWVmNS1iMjg0LWU5MDljMWI0MjViNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#migrants-guantanamo-trump" data-source-id="100000009969010"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hamed-aleaziz"><img alt="Hamed Aleaziz" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/09/reader-center/author-hamed-aleaziz/author-hamed-aleaziz-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-schmitt"><img alt="Eric Schmitt" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-eric-schmitt/author-eric-schmitt-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-04T18:01:48.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 4, 2025, 1:01 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Air Force transport plane preparing to deport migrants from El Paso last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Trump administration plans to begin flying migrants in military planes from El Paso to the U.S. Navy base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on Tuesday, according to three U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans.</p><p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed the move, saying on Fox Business that “the first flights from the United States to Guantánamo Bay with illegal migrants are underway.”</p><div><p>The decision is a change in how the United States handles people it deports. The U.S. government has long held migrants it picked up at sea in a facility at Guantánamo Bay, but it has not flown migrants from within the United States to the base.</p><p>It also serves as a significant symbol of President Trump’s attempts to cut off legal and illegal immigration, a key pillar of his campaign for the presidency and part of his promise for his administration. Last week, Mr. Trump ordered the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/guantanamo-trump-migrants.html" title="">to prepare to expand Guantánamo Bay</a> for the detention of migrants.</p><p>“We have 30,000 beds in Guantánamo to detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people,” he said. “Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold them because we don’t want them coming back, so we’re going to send them out to Guantánamo.”</p><p>Mr. Trump said it was also a “tough place to get out of.”</p><p>About 300 service members have<strong> </strong>already arrived at Guantánamo Bay to provide security and begin setting up at a new tent city for the migrants. U.S. forces have put up 50 Army green tents inside a chain-link-fence enclosure, adjacent to a barracks-style building called the Migrant Operations Center.</p><p>On Sunday, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, said the facility would be an asset for the agency.</p><p>“We’re just building out some capacity,” she said on “Meet the Press.” “So we appreciate the partnership of the D.O.D. in getting that up to the level that it needs to get to in order to facilitate this repatriation of people back to their countries. So remember that Guantánamo Bay clearly, by this president, has said that it will hold the worst of the worst, that we are going after those bad actors.”</p><p>In recent weeks, about 40,000 immigrants have been held in private detention centers and local jails around the country as funding constraints have limited the number of detention sites.</p><p>The U.S. government has long held migrants at Guantánamo Bay. Those migrants, however, have been caught at sea and were forced to pass screenings on their asylum claims.

Carr, the acting executive secretary, asking for the “leanest essential personnel numbers” they would need “in order to provide essential services only,” according to a copy viewed by The New York Times. They were given less than an hour to furnish the lists.</p><p>The email was the latest sign that Mr. Rubio and Pete Marocco, the State Department’s foreign assistance director whom Mr. Rubio named as his deputy to run day-to-day operations at the agency, plan to drastically scale back the operations of the government’s lead agency for humanitarian aid and international development.</p><p>Many of the agency’s senior staff were put on leave last week, after representatives of Elon Musk, the tech magnate whom President Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/musk-federal-government.html" title="">empowered to run a cost-cutting task force</a>, entered headquarters and began to take over its operations. On Saturday, the agency’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/usaid-official-leave-musk.html" title="">two top security officials were put on administrative leave</a> after they tried to prevent Mr. Musk’s representatives from entering secure spaces and getting access to classified materials for which they lacked the proper security clearances.</p><p>On Monday, most of the agency’s contractors and direct civil service hires lost access to their email and other systems, and were told by senior officials that they should take that as an indication that they had been placed on administrative leave. By Tuesday, rumors were circulating that employees in missions overseas might be called home, as contractors reliant on U.S.A.I.D. funding for projects slashed staff to continue their work.</p><p>As U.S.A.I.D. operations were being ground to a near halt, Mr. Musk took to social media to decry the agency as “evil” and a “criminal organization,” while Mr. Trump said it was run by a bunch of “radical lunatics.”</p><p>Mr. Rubio did not endorse Mr. Musk’s view of the agency during his Fox interview, insisting that there were some programs that ought to be preserved, even as he defended efforts to pause most of the agency’s operations. Mr. Rubio did not specify which programs he thought had merit.</p><p>Senate Democrats have rejected Mr. Rubio’s stated reasons for taking over U.S.A.I.D., which he also laid out in a letter on Monday to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House committees on foreign affairs and related appropriations. In the letter, Mr. Rubio warned that a review of U.S.A.I.D. programs could lead to “the suspension or elimination” of programs, projects, missions, bureaus, centers and offices, or the abolition of the entire agency.</p><p>“I find it wholly insufficient on the law and devoid of any rationale for the drastic, abrupt action the administration has taken, with no prior notice to Congress,” Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.</p><p>Democrats were buoyed Monday by a new report from the Congressional Research Service, which determined that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to order structural changes to the agency without congressional approval.</p><p>“Because Congress established U.S.A.I.D. as an independent establishment (defined in 5 U.S.C. 104) within the executive branch, the president does not have the authority to abolish it,” the report states. “Congressional authorization would be required to abolish, move or consolidate U.S.A.I.D.”</p><p>Still, leading Republicans welcomed Mr. Trump’s moves.</p><p>“I’ve said for years that the greatest national security threat Americans face is our skyrocketing national debt,” Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement, arguing that the idea of merging U.S.A.I.D. and the State Department was not new.</p><p>“I’m supportive of the Trump administration’s efforts to reform and restructure the agency in a way that better serves U.S. national security interests,” he added.</p><p>On Tuesday, questions also swirled around the future shape of the State Department’s democracy, human rights and labor bureau. On Monday, the department told companies that employ the bureau’s 60 or so contractors that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/democracy-human-rights-fired.html" title="">it was issuing stop-work orders on the contracts</a>. Some of the companies could try to push back on those orders, and the fate of the dozens of contractors is unclear. In the crisis involving U.S.A.I.D., federal stop-work orders have led to contracting companies firing hundreds of contractors.</p><p>The bureau has had an annual budget of $150 million to $200 million in recent years, and it oversees about $3 billion of active grants. Its contractors are area specialists and tech experts who help enact programs around the globe to try to expand democratic practices and civil rights, including in China, Russia, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba, among the world’s most repressive nations.</p><p>Edward Wong<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNTQ2OGE1MjgtZjIxNi01ZmQ1LThiZWYtMmZkZDYxZTUzM2Y4"><div id="5468a528-f216-5fd5-8bef-2fdd61e533f8" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#5468a528-f216-5fd5-8bef-2fdd61e533f8"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley"><img alt="Michael Crowley" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/reader-center/author-michael-crowley/author-michael-crowley-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-04T17:19:38.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 4, 2025, 12:19 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-crowley" itemprop="name">Michael Crowley</a></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Central America</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio says that the Trump administration “will have to study” an offer by El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/el-salvador-prisons-marco-rubio.html" title="">accept and jail deported American convicts</a>. “There are obviously legalities involved” in sending Americans to a foreign prison, Rubio says, including constitutional issues. “But it’s a very generous offer,” he adds.</p><p>“We’ll have to study it and see how something like that can even be applied,” Rubio says. </p><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/04/04vid-Tariff-blog-88715-cover/04vid-Tariff-blog-88715-cover-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="24" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvZWU4YmQxNDAtMzY2YS01OWRhLWI0MDAtZWE4ZDFiYWJlNDJm"><div id="ee8bd140-366a-59da-b400-ea8d1babe42f" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#ee8bd140-366a-59da-b400-ea8d1babe42f"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maya-c-miller"><img alt="Maya C.

Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, was a yes on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>Mr. Cassidy, a doctor, <a href="#rfk-jr-senate-vote-finance-committee" title="">voted with the rest of the members of his party</a> who sit on the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday to forward Mr. Kennedy’s nomination for health secretary to the full Senate, easing Mr. Kennedy’s path to confirmation. His approval ended a days-long drama in which he had publicly agonized over how to vote, given his deep unease with Mr. Kennedy’s long history of questioning vaccines.</p><div><p>He said he has had a weekend of “intense conversations” with Mr. Kennedy and the White House, including Vice President JD Vance, and had extracted commitments from Mr. Kennedy to not to move ahead with changing vaccine policy without the assent of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which Mr. Cassidy leads, and to work closely with him.</p><p>“My expectation that we can have a great working relationship to ‘make America healthy again’ is the basis of our support,” Mr. Cassidy said, using the phrase Mr. Kennedy has adopted for his movement. “He will be a secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner.”</p><p>Mr. Cassidy got his medical degree from Louisiana State University’s School of Medicine, where he worked teaching medical students and residents at a hospital for the uninsured. During that time, in the early 1990s, he co-founded a community clinic that provided free dental and medical care to the working uninsured in his hometown of Baton Rouge, according to his official biography.</p><p>He also created a public-private partnership to vaccinate 36,000 residents in the Baton Rouge area against hepatitis B, at no cost to schools or patients. Mr. Cassidy opened last Thursday’s health committee hearing with a dramatic tale from his own medical practice: the story of a young woman, suffering from acute liver failure because of a hepatitis B infection, who had to be airlifted to a hospital for an emergency liver transplant.</p><p>“Now, the transplant, an invasive — in 2000 — quarter-of-a-million-dollar surgery that had a 5 to 10 percent mortality rate, but even if she survived, will leave her with a liver transplant and hospital bills every year of $50,000,” he said.</p><p>“And as she took off,” he continued, “it was the worst day of my medical career, because I thought: ‘$50 of vaccines could have prevented this all.’ And that was an inflection point in my career, and since then, I have tried to do everything I can to make sure I never have to speak to another parent about their child dying due to a vaccine-preventable disease.”</p><p>Throughout the Thursday hearing, Mr. Cassidy made clear that he worried Mr. Kennedy would use his star power and large following of “MAHA Moms” — a reference to “Make America Healthy Again” — to continue to sow doubts about vaccines, which public health experts consider a singular triumph of their field. Vaccines have eradicated smallpox and nearly eliminated polio, diseases that were once major killers.</p><p>“My phone blows up with people who really follow you, and there are many who trust you more than they trust their own physician,” Mr. Cassidy told Mr. Kennedy as the hearing began. “And so the question I need to have answered is, what will you do with that trust?”</p><p>In Louisiana, Mr. Cassidy is facing a primary challenger, John Fleming, a former congressman and current state treasurer who has cited the senator’s vote to convict Mr. Trump on a single article of impeachment related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>Mr. Cassidy said in a statement at the time: “Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty.”</p><p>In his conversations with Mr. Kennedy and the White House over the weekend, Mr. Cassidy said, he extracted a series of a commitments, including that Mr. Kennedy and he would have “an unprecedentedly close, collaborative working relationship.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy has spent years sowing mistrust about the agencies he would oversee if confirmed as health secretary; he has repeatedly attacked the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as corrupt. He also has a large following of fellow skeptics.</p><p>Mr. Cassidy said he became convinced that Mr. Kennedy was the right person to restore trust in the nation’s public health institutions. He made clear that he intended to vote in favor of the nomination once it reaches the Senate floor.</p><p>As chairman of the Senate health committee, the other panel before which Mr. Kennedy appeared for a confirmation hearing last week, Mr. Cassidy made several comments making clear that while he wanted to support Mr. Trump’s pick, Mr. Kennedy’s refusal to disavow some of his past claims about vaccines — including that they cause autism, a theory that was long ago debunked — was very much an issue.</p><p>“I’m a doc trying to understand,” Mr. Cassidy said at one point. “Convince me that you will become the public health advocate, but not just churn old information so that there’s never a conclusion.”</p><p>Over the weekend, he posted on X, the social media site owned by Elon Musk, what many took as a hint: a quote from the Bible on the topic of courage.</p><p>“Joshua said to them: ‘Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight,’” he wrote. </p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMjU0MTQ0NWYtZTY1Ny01MTdjLTg3NTQtNjg1NTQ4MDM3MjVj"><div id="2541445f-e657-517c-8754-68554803725c" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#2541445f-e657-517c-8754-68554803725c"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs"><img alt="Zolan Kanno-Youngs" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/reader-center/author-zolan-kanno-youngs/author-zolan-kanno-youngs-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-04T16:13:50.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 4, 2025, 11:13 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Vice President JD Vance will travel to Europe next week to attend a conference in Paris on artificial intelligence and another in Munich on international security, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNGVlMmVlZTktNTVhZC01ZTZjLWE0ODItYjA2YTI1ODBlYTk5"><div id="4ee2eee9-55ad-5e6c-a482-b06a2580ea99" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard#4ee2eee9-55ad-5e6c-a482-b06a2580ea99"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robert-jimison"><img alt="Robert Jimison" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/reader-center/author-robert-jimison/author-robert-jimison-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2025-02-04T15:46:54.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Feb. 4, 2025, 10:46 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, says he will support Tulsi Gabbard to become director of national intelligence, giving her an important boost in her confirmation push.

Bush and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/us/politics/14cards.html" title="">Barack Obama</a>. The idea received new life in September when President Trump, then on the campaign trail, said he supported a temporary 10 percent limit on credit card rates “while working Americans catch up.”</p><div><p>That exact cap is contained in Tuesday’s legislation to amend the 1968 Truth in Lending Act, proposed by two senators who aren’t typically ideological allies: Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri. Both separately participated in earlier attempts to impose a cap.</p><p>The average credit card interest rate is now more than 20 percent, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/advice/current-interest-rates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Bankrate</a>. The metric has risen over the past decade; <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/credit-card-interest-rate-margins-at-all-time-high/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at 22.8 percent in 2023</a>, credit card companies were charging their highest rates since the Federal Reserve began collecting data in 1994.</p><p>The new limit would expire in 2031, after Mr. Trump’s term. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether the administration would back it.</p><p>“We cannot continue to allow big banks to rip off Americans by charging outrageously high credit card interest rates,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement. Mr. Hawley, who has fashioned himself a populist on economist issues, described current interest rates as “exploitative.”</p><p>The proposal can be counted on producing a dim response from the banks and the credit card industry.

Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation hearing before Senate Finance Committee last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the high-profile critic of vaccines who turned away from the Democratic Party to align himself with President Trump, moved one step closer to becoming the nation’s health secretary on Tuesday, after a dramatic party-line vote in the Senate Finance Committee in which a key Republican tilted the balance in Mr. Kennedy’s favor.</p><p>By a vote of 14 to 13, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats against, the finance panel forwarded Mr. Kennedy’s nomination to the full Senate with a recommendation of approval. The deciding vote was cast by Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a doctor, who was deeply uneasy about Mr. Kennedy and had been publicly agonizing for days over what to do.</p><div><p>Shortly before the vote, Mr. Trump weighed in with a post on social media about rising rates of autism. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kennedy have embraced the theory, long debunked, that vaccines are linked to autism in children; Mr. Kennedy’s refusal to disavow such statements were a flashpoint during his confirmation hearings. Numerous studies have found no association.</p><p>“20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000,” Mr. Trump wrote. “NOW IT’S 1 in 34. WOW! Something’s really wrong. We need BOBBY!!!”</p><p>In the end, after a weekend of “intense conversations” with Mr. Kennedy, the White House and Vice President JD Vance, Mr. Cassidy said he had concluded that Mr. Kennedy, as a longtime critic of the nation’s public health and biomedical institutions, was uniquely positioned to restore trust in agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>“He will be a secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner,” Mr. Cassidy said.</p><p>Tuesday’s vote was a demonstration of Mr. Trump’s tight grip on the Republican Party and its allies. Mr. Kennedy’s flip-flops on abortion have worried many in the anti-abortion movement, including former Vice President Mike Pence, who has worked actively against Mr. Kennedy. But anti-abortion groups have not opposed Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>One Republican, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, justified his vote in favor of Mr. Kennedy by citing the silence of the anti-abortion movement, as well as the agriculture industry, which is leery of Mr. Kennedy’s vow to ban corn syrup, and the National Rifle Association, which worries about his advocacy for gun safety laws.</p><p>“I believe that silence is consent,” Mr. Tillis said.</p><p>Mr. Cassidy, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he had also extracted a series of commitments from Mr. Kennedy to work closely with the panel and to give Congress advance notice of any changes he might make in vaccine policy.</p><p>“I want Mr. Kennedy to succeed making America healthy again,” Mr. Cassidy said. “His success will be tied to the health of our nation.”</p><p>The vote ended days of political theater, in which the senator from Louisiana seemed so conflicted that many thought he might vote for Mr. Kennedy in committee and then change his vote when the nomination went before the full Senate. Mr. Cassidy made clear on Tuesday that this would not be the case. He said he looked forward to working with Mr. Kennedy if he was confirmed.</p><p>A floor vote has not yet been scheduled, but is likely next week. After the committee vote on Tuesday, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, insisted that Democrats, who have cast Mr. Kennedy as dangerous to Americans’ health, would not give up. He said they would take their case to the American people, presumably with email and phone blitzes and advertising by allied groups.</p><p>“We’re going to pull out all the stops,” said Mr. Wyden, the top Democrat on the panel. “There are senators who I believe are going to vote no on the floor.”</p><p>He added, “This is not over yet.”</p><p>But allies of Mr. Kennedy will undoubtedly have their own campaign. Del Bigtree, a Kennedy ally whose super PAC backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election, said his group would continue to “share the voice of the people” and was likely to run advertisements in support of Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>It is still possible that Mr. Kennedy’s nomination could be defeated. He has drawn criticism from two other notable Republicans: Senator Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor and the former Republican leader, and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who last week spoke of the importance of vaccination to the survival of Alaska’s Native communities.</p><p>If Mr. Kennedy is confirmed, he will oversee a vast, sprawling agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, with 80,000 employees and 13 operating divisions.</p><p>In addition to overseeing the nation’s biomedical and public health establishment, the department also has responsibility for Medicare, the government insurance program for older Americans, and Medicaid, the federal-state partnership that provides health coverage to low-income and working people.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s scant knowledge of those programs gave Democrats pause. During last week’s confirmation hearings, he repeatedly confused the two. Democrats are also alarmed by Mr. Kennedy’s work helping law firms sue vaccine manufacturers who are regulated by the FDA, an agency he would oversee.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy’s promise to turn his stake in a vaccine lawsuit over to his son drew a sharp rebuke from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who said, “That’s a fig leaf that is so small it would take a magnifying glass to see.”</p><p>Democrats’ opposition to Mr. Kennedy also underscored the shifting alliances in Washington and American politics more broadly. Mr. Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic political dynasty, has angered many in his family, and their party, with his embrace of Mr. Trump. Voting against him made for an uncomfortable moment for some Democrats on the committee.</p><p>Among them was Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, whose father, Paul Cantwell, a congressman from Indiana, was with Mr. Kennedy’s father on the night in 1968 when the elder Kennedy delivered the news to the nation that Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated.</p><p>“I told him in my office, ‘The Kennedys stood up,’” Ms. Cantwell said.</p><p>For Mr. Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican, voting against Mr. Kennedy — and defying Mr. Trump — would have been politically perilous. He is up for re-election in 2026 and is already facing a primary challenge from the right.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/30/us/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-health" title="">last week’s confirmation hearing before the health committee</a>, Mr. Cassidy said he was worried that Mr. Kennedy would use his platform as a cabinet secretary to continue to cast doubt on vaccines and that he was too old to change.</p><p>“Does a 70-year-old man, 71-year-old man who spent decades criticizing vaccines, and who’s financially invested in finding fault with vaccines — can he change his attitudes and approach now that he’ll have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?” Mr. Cassidy asked.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Cassidy did not sound entirely convinced that Mr. Kennedy could change. He delivered a pointed reminder on one crucial point — whether vaccines cause autism — where he and Mr. Kennedy continue to disagree.</p><p>“Mr. Kennedy has been insistent that he just wants good science and to ensure safety,” Mr. Cassidy said. “But on this topic, the science is good, the science is critical. Vaccines save lives. They are safe. They do not cause autism. There are multiple studies that show this. They are a crucial part of our nation’s public health response.”</p><p>Robert Jimison<!-- --> and <!-- -->Christina Jewett<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
