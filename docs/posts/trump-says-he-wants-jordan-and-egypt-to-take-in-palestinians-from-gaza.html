He added that he would also like Egypt to take in more Palestinians and that he would speak to the country’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, on Sunday.</p><p>Mr. Trump made the remarks on an evening flight after a rally in Las Vegas; it is unclear whether they signal a change in U.S. policy toward Palestinians.</p><p>Tens of thousands of Palestinians have started <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-returning-home-after-war.html" title="">returning</a> to their homes as the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel enters a second week.

Since then, Israel’s military has killed at least 46,000 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/health/gaza-death-toll.html" title="">Palestinians</a>, according to Gazan health officials who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. It has also destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in Gaza and killed many of Hamas’s leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Most of the two million Palestinians in Gaza have had to flee their homes at least once. And though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-cease-fire-aid.html" title="">aid in recent days has increased</a>, the humanitarian situation remains dire, with water, food and medicine running low and few working hospitals left.</p><p>“You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,” Mr. Trump said of Gaza. “I don’t know. Something has to happen, but it’s literally a demolition site right now.”</p><p>Millions of Palestinian refugees are living in camps in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and a few other countries in the Middle East. Since the start of the war, Egypt has said that it will not take in any more Palestinian refugees, and that any attempt to force Palestinians into their territory risks agreements that it has with Israel.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Trump and his administration.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
