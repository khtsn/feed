He was 69.</p><p>Jeffrey Goldberg, Mr. Todd’s manager, announced the death in a statement on Saturday morning. He did not specify the cause.</p><p>Mr. Todd’s decades-long acting career spanned genres and mediums. He starred or had prominent roles in several films, including the 1990 remake of “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100258/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cred_c_228" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Night of the Living Dead</a>,” “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109506/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_t_4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Crow</a>,” “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_t_2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Rock</a>” and Oliver Stone’s <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1987/memorable-moments" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oscar-winning</a> Vietnam War movie, “<a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/?ref_=tt_mv_desc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Platoon</a>.” His television credits include “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” “24,” “The X-Files,” and many other shows. He also lent his rich voice to animation and video games.</p><p>He was perhaps best known for his role as the titular demon in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/16/movies/review-film-science-fiction-horrors-in-a-housing-project.html" title="">1992 movie “Candyman,”</a> He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/movies/tony-todd-candyman.html" title="">told The New York Times</a> in 2020 that he was proud of playing the terrifying figure with a hook for a hand, a Black man who had been wronged in life and is summoned from the beyond by people who call his name five times while looking in a mirror — unleashing vicious attacks in which the Candyman slices to death those who dared to disturb him. “If I had never done another horror film,” he said, “I could live with that, and I’d carry this character.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Todd reprised the role in the film’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112625/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1995</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165662/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1999</a> sequels and returned to it for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/movies/candyman-review.html" title="">2021 reboot</a>, directed by Nia DaCosta and written by Jordan Peele.</p><p>In the “Final Destination” franchise, Mr. Todd <a href="https://screenrant.com/final-destination-6-william-bludworth-tony-todd-character/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">played the role</a> of the mysterious funeral-home owner William Bludworth — the rare recurring character in a film series that famously killed off all of its new characters by the time the end credits rolled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Todd in what was probably his best-known role, as the titular demon in the 1992 film “Candyman.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">RGR Collection/Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Born on Dec. 4, 1954, in Washington, Mr. Todd earned a master’s degree from the Trinity Repertory Company, studied at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center, in Waterford, Conn., and got started in political theater. He told The Times in 2020 that theater was his “first love.” </p><p>Mr. Todd “gave his time and resources to aspiring actors, consistently advocating for greater representation and authenticity within the industry,” Mr. Goldberg said in his statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>On a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCI15euOYdr/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a>, Virginia Madsen, who starred with Mr. Todd in the original “Candyman,” called him a “poetic man” with a “voice that made it easy to swoon.” Mr. Todd, Ms. Madsen said, was the “rare actor who allowed himself to be open to the public attention.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Todd gave of his time to other aspiring actors and was an advocate for diversity and authenticity in the film industry.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clifford Prince King for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Information on survivors was not immediately available.</p><p>In the 2020 interview, Mr. Todd said that about 30 percent of his résumé was in horror roles, and that he kept going back to theater whenever film work became too boring or repetitive. He also noted that when he got started in the business, he would often show up on a set to find that “not only would I be the only Black actor, I would be the only Black person in jobs that anybody should have the opportunity to do if it wasn’t for nepotism.”</p><p>But that had changed over time, he said, and he would find people who looked like him all over the set, including people who knew how to apply his makeup and how to light him to counter the industry’s shortcomings in properly capturing his skin tone.</p><p>“Just the joy that occurred,” he said, “finally being allowed to the dance.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
