America can outlast China in a trade war. Those advantages will let the administration get big concessions and rebalance global commerce.</p><p>Trump’s actions, however, suggest the talk was bluster. Yesterday, his administration cut its China tariffs from 145 percent to 30 percent for at least a few months. China will reciprocate by lowering its retaliatory levies from 125 percent to 10 percent. Both sides will keep talking.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sources: White House; China’s Ministry of Finance | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But China made no concessions. By now, most of us are familiar with this pattern: Trump makes big claims about what his tariffs can get, only for him to later back down without the other country giving up anything meaningful. It happened with Mexico, Canada and most of Trump’s “Liberation Day” levies. Despite his claims, America seems to need other countries’ trade as much as they need ours, diminishing Trump’s negotiating position. Today’s newsletter explains.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-59be7428">Price hikes and shortages</h2><p>Here’s the problem: Trade is mutually beneficial. The buyer gets a good, and the seller makes a profit. The United States runs a trade deficit with China — it buys more than it sells — because Americans have the cash and want what China is selling.</p><p>Trump’s tariffs on China were so high that they were effectively an embargo that threatened to end all of those mutually beneficial transactions. That would cover a lot of goods — more than 70 percent of smartphones, laptops and toys — as well as manufacturing materials, particularly rare earth metals used in modern electronics. Retailers warned that prices would rise and shelves would go empty. Markets tumbled.</p><p>The hits to the economy weakened Trump’s negotiating position, and China knew it. Americans spent the last few years fuming about inflation and supply mishaps, and they would be furious if those problems continued. And unlike previous bouts of inflation that leaders could pin on the pandemic or the Ukraine war, this time it would clearly be Trump’s fault.</p><p>So China took a patient approach. Let prices rise and markets fall, and eventually Trump would have to give in. That strategy worked, at least for now.</p><h2 id="link-41261b74">What remains</h2><p>Trump still has time to get some concessions out of China, which does not want to lose its biggest global customer. The concessions could be small. In the past, countries have given Trump minor compromises in response to tariffs — enough for him to save face, essentially — as when Canada vaguely promised to step up border enforcement earlier this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the meantime, tariffs remain much higher than they were before Trump’s second term. When Trump ran for president, many economists warned that his promise of 10 percent tariffs on every other country would hurt the economy. Even after all of Trump’s backpedaling, a 10 percent universal tariff is still in place. Duties on specific goods, such as cars, are even higher. Prices on clothes, appliances, video game consoles and everything else made in other countries will likely rise as a result.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>The cut in tariffs on China is, for now, temporary. While some importers could rush to order Chinese goods, others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/economy/trump-china-trade-shipments.html" title="">may move more cautiously</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trade experts warned that 90 days <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/economy/trump-trade-china-tariffs.html" title="">may not be enough time</a> to make substantial progress on the U.S. and China’s long list of trade disputes.</p></li><li><p>America must reckon with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/business/china-economy-us-trade-war.html" title="">two sides of China’s economy</a>, Li Yuan writes: One is a technology superpower, and the other is struggling.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-34341511"><span><strong>INSIDE THE CONCLAVE</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Rome, before the conclave. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Murad Sezer/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The most-clicked link in the newsletter yesterday was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/world/europe/conclave-vote-pope-leo-robert-prevost.html" title="">the remarkable inside story</a> of how cardinals picked the new pope.</p><p>It’s always a feat to get skittish officials to confide in reporters. Yet Times journalists persuaded many Vatican leaders (sworn to secrecy on pain of excommunication!) to share how they narrowed three front-runners down to a single obvious choice. I asked Jason Horowitz, our Rome bureau chief, how they reported it out. <em>— Adam B. Kushner</em></p><p><strong>I thought deliberations inside the Sistine Chapel were sacrosanct!</strong></p><p>Nobody said, “I voted for X.” Nobody told us, “The tally was within 10 votes and then Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost crept up.” Nobody gave a level of granular detail that could get them in trouble. But we used a lot of shoe-leather reporting — tracking cardinals down, finding them on the phone, leaning on relationships built over years. Each gave us a small kernel of detail. The combination revealed a picture of what happened.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>We learned how Prevost avoided politicking at dinner on the conclave’s first night, how he held his head as the final votes were counted. What does the vow of secrecy cover, exactly?</strong></p><p>I think it’s like how Justice Potter Stewart described obscenity — you know it when you see it. I didn’t advise sources to cross an ethical line. One cardinal said it happened on the fourth vote, and maybe that stretches the rules. But it’s just that we spoke to so many people that we could piece it together. It was more the collective work than one revelatory interview.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-1e05c158">Trump in the Middle East</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-gulf-trip.html" title="">landed in Saudi Arabia</a> this morning, his first stop in a four-day tour of the Gulf.
