name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Only a few years ago, Washington was calling Saudi Arabia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/world/middleeast/saudi-leader-prince-mohammed.html" title="">a “pariah”</a> over its headline-making human rights violations. Western business leaders canceled investments in the kingdom. Celebrities and sports stars took flack for doing events there.</p><p>With its oil and its regional clout, however, Saudi Arabia proved too useful for the Biden administration to push the kingdom away for too long. And just a few weeks into the second term of President Trump, who nurtured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-biden-trump.html" title="">a cozy relationship</a> with the kingdom when he was last in office, Saudi Arabia’s stock is once again on the rise — even if Mr. Trump’s approach to the region is not always to the Saudis’ liking.</p><p>This week, all of the diplomacy is in Riyadh, the kingdom’s capital. On Friday, Arab leaders are expected to gather to hammer out a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/middleeast/gaza-reconstruction-alternatives.html" title="">counterproposal</a> meant to persuade Mr. Trump not to deport all of the some two million people in Gaza to Arab countries, mainly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-egypt-jordan.html" title="">Egypt and Jordan</a>, and transform the strip into a “Riviera of the Middle East.”</p><p>On Tuesday, senior American and Russian officials met in Riyadh for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">opening talks</a> over ending the war in Ukraine and re-establishing normal relations, another major foreign policy priority of Mr. Trump’s. The Russian delegation was based at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, where Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/middleeast/ritz-carlton-riyadh-saudi-princes.html" title="">locked up</a> hundreds of powerful businessmen and royal family members in an early quest to consolidate power. (Saudi Arabia said it was a crackdown on corruption.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>This time, Saudi Arabia was presenting a very different image, facilitating the talks on Tuesday with a lunch menu of Arab and Western specialties that included a “symphony of scallop, shrimps and salmon” and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014520-knafeh-a-la-creme?q=knafe" title="">knafeh</a> cheesecake, according to Russian state television.</p><p>“Country of peace,” read the hashtag accompanying some <a href="https://x.com/KSAMOFA/status/1891903629008785481" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media posts</a> about the Tuesday talks from government and state media accounts.

I believe we can achieve positive things, for Saudi Arabia and for many countries around the world.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also spoke late Wednesday at an investment summit in Miami Beach hosted by Saudi Arabia’s affluent sovereign wealth fund in which he praised Riyadh’s role in the Russia-U.S. talks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Saudis’ big week in international diplomacy has been long in the making. The Arab world’s traditional leaders, including Egypt, Iraq and Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/world/middleeast/saudis-expand-regional-power-as-others-falter.html" title="">are weakened</a> by years of internal turmoil. Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has taken advantage of its size, wealth and status as the guardian of some of Islam’s holiest sites to fill that gap.</p><p>The high-profile diplomacy “serves to showcase the kingdom’s global influence and regional leadership,” said Hasan Alhasan, a senior fellow for Middle East Policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a policy analysis group. He noted that waning U.S. influence on the global stage had allowed “agile actors” like Saudi Arabia to step up.</p><p>Analysts, including some close to the royal court, said a canny Saudi strategy to cultivate relations beyond the United States during the years of strain with the Biden administration had paid off in the U.S.-Russia talks on Tuesday.</p><p>In recent years, Saudi Arabia has built economic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/world/middleeast/saudi-china-investment-forum.html" title="">links with China</a> and avoided taking sides in the war in Ukraine. Its neutrality allowed it to help broker prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine and Russia and the United States, and to host both Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky — though Mr. Zelensky canceled a planned visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday out of frustration at being excluded from the previous day’s talks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine last February with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh.

As Israel’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">assault on Gaza</a> intensified after the Hamas-led <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/issue/world/2024/10/21/the-oct-7-attacks" title="">Oct. 7, 2023, attack</a>, the Saudis also increasingly conditioned the deal on a pathway toward statehood for the Palestinians, a long-held dream for most of the Arab world.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Its continuing talks with the United States and Israel over normalization, along with the fact that it is expected to help fund any reconstruction of Gaza, makes Saudi Arabia a natural choice to convene Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar on Friday to discuss a reconstruction proposal for Gaza that they hope will serve as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/middleeast/gaza-reconstruction-alternatives.html" title="">an alternative</a> to Mr. Trump’s ideas for the territory.</p><p>The proposed grand bargain between Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/us/politics/israel-saudi-arabia-gaza.html" title="">first shepherded</a> by the Biden administration. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. saw opportunity in the agreement even though, as a candidate, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/us/politics/biden-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html" title="">declared Saudi Arabia</a> a “pariah” over its bombings of civilians in Yemen and Saudi agents’ gruesome <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006154117/khashoggi-istanbul-death-saudi-consulate.html" title="">killing of Jamal Khashoggi</a>, a Saudi Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident.</p><p>Still, it is Mr. Trump, whose first visit to a foreign country in his first term was to Saudi Arabia, who has elevated the Gulf kingdom to the status of trusted friend and partner in global affairs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Trump’s first visit to a foreign country in his first term was to Saudi Arabia in May 2017.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Crowley/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Trump is recognizing them as the Arab leader,” said Hussein Ibish, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “They wanted to be treated like that, and under Trump they are being treated like that.”</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/world/europe/trump-putin-saudi-arabia-ukraine.html" title="">has said</a> the kingdom was chosen for his potential first meeting with Mr. Putin since returning to the White House because of the two presidents’ relationship with Prince Mohammed. Mr. Trump proposed the country in his phone call last week with Mr. Putin as a venue, according to Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman.</p><p>“We know the crown prince, and I think it’d be a very good place to be,” Mr. Trump said last week.</p><p>Yet if Mr. Trump handed Saudi Arabia an unqualified win by selecting it to host the U.S.-Russia talks, his return to the White House has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-israel-palestinians.html" title="">also imperiled</a> another major priority for Prince Mohammed: securing a defense pact and help with developing a civilian nuclear program from the United States in exchange for normalizing relations with Israel.</p><p>Forcibly expelling Palestinians from Gaza, as Mr. Trump has proposed, would be not only a war crime that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/middleeast/international-law-trump-gaza.html" title="">violates international law</a>, according to experts, but would also erase any remaining hope of a Palestinian state on existing Palestinian land. The Saudi population overwhelmingly supports Palestinian statehood, and Prince Mohammed has shown he will not go against its wishes: The Saudi government responded to Mr. Trump’s proposal by announcing that it would not normalize with Israel without a Palestinian state being established.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In the northern Gaza Strip this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The precondition, which the Saudis have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/saudi-arabia-palestine-trump-gaza.html" title="">insisted on</a> for the past year, is “nonnegotiable and not subject to compromises,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in <a href="https://x.com/KSAmofaEN/status/1886953044484473007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a> this month.</p><p>Given Israel’s opposition to Palestinian statehood, the chances of a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal, along with the Saudi-U.S. defense agreement, look increasingly remote, at least in the near term, Mr. Ibish said.</p><p>Even so, Saudi officials may have reaped benefits on that front from the time they spent with senior Trump administration officials in Riyadh this week.</p><p>Fostering ties with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and especially Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s who serves as his special envoy to the Middle East, may help Saudi Arabia in its dealings with the United States over Gaza and normalization, Saudi political analysts said. Prince Mohammed spoke to Mr. Rubio about Gaza and Ukraine on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff, who, like his boss, is a New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/us/politics/witkoff-trump-middle-east-envoy.html" title="">real estate magnate</a>, has emerged as a key figure at the heart of Mr. Trump’s foreign deal-making. He stepped beyond his ostensible job title to attend the Russia-U.S. talks in Riyadh on Tuesday and help secure <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/marc-fogel-teacher-released-russia.html" title="">the release</a> last week of Marc Fogel, an American teacher held in Russia since 2021.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Witkoff will “undoubtedly listen carefully to what the Saudis have to say about Gaza,” said Salman al-Ansari, a Saudi analyst. “Although there were initial disagreements regarding Gaza, I believe they will find a way forward.”</p><p>In any case, the two countries’ relationship does not hinge only on normalization, the defense pact or Palestinian statehood, especially under Mr. Trump. That was amply demonstrated in late January, when Prince Mohammed told Mr. Trump that Saudi Arabia intended to bolster its investment and trade with the United States by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-us-saudi-arabia-investment-trade.html" title="">at least $600 billion</a> over the next four years.</p><p>Anton Troianovski<!-- --> contributed reporting from Riyadh, and <!-- -->Kate Kelly<!-- --> from Florida.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
