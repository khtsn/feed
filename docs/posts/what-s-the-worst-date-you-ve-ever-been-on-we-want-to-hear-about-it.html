But sometimes you have a date where something so absurd, embarrassing or infuriating happens that your only positive takeaway is the story you can tell your friends afterward.</p><p>Modern Love is all about how messy it can be to find, keep or lose love. We’re working on a podcast episode where you can air your dating grievances, so you can go into 2025 with a clean slate, ready to try again.</p><p>So, we want to know: What is the worst date you’ve been on? What made it so bad? How did it make you feel, and what did you learn from it? You do not have to be single to share your story.</p><p><strong>Please record your response as a voice memo and email it to </strong><strong><a href="mailto:modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com" title="">modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com</a></strong><strong> by Dec. 2, 2024.</strong> Start by telling us your full name, your pronouns and what city you live in.
