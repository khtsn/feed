Pakistani military officials said that five places had been hit, in Punjab Province and its part of Kashmir.</p><p>“Our actions have been focused, measured, and nonescalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted,” the Indian government said.</p><p>In its own statement, the Pakistani government said that the strikes “will not go unanswered” and that it would respond at “a time and place of its own choosing.” It added, “The temporary pleasure of India will be replaced by enduring grief.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Pakistani military officials said they had begun a “measured but forceful” response. They did not share operational details but said that retaliation was underway.</p><p>Indian officials did not detail the precise nature of the strikes.</p><p>Residents of Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani part of Kashmir, reported hearing jets flying above. They said that a site in a rural area near Muzaffarabad that was once used by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant group based in Pakistan, appeared to have been targeted in the strikes.</p><p>A spokesman for the Pakistani Army said that four other places had also come under attack. One was Bahawalpur, in Punjab Province, the site of a religious seminary associated with Jaish-e-Mohammad, another Pakistan-based militant group; another was Kotli, a city in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Pakistani military said that Indian planes did not enter Pakistan’s airspace in conducting the attacks.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Indian forces are calling their military operation Sindoor, a reference to the red vermilion that Hindu women wear in their hair after marriage. It refers to the gruesome nature of the terrorist attack two weeks ago, in which many wives saw their husbands killed in front of them.</p><p>“Victory to Mother India,” Rajnath Singh, India’s defense minister, wrote on X.</p><p>In the April 22 attack, militants opened fire on tourists in the Indian-administered region of Kashmir, killing 26 and injuring more than a dozen others.</p><p>The massacre was one of the worst attacks on Indian civilians in decades, and India was quick to suggest that Pakistan, its neighbor and archenemy, had been involved. The two nuclear-armed countries have fought several wars over Kashmir, a region that they share but that each claims in whole.</p><p>The Pakistani government has denied involvement in the attack, and India has presented little evidence to support its accusations. Still, soon after the onslaught, India announced a flurry of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/asia/kashmir-attack-india-pakistan.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">punitive measures</a> against Pakistan, including threatening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/world/asia/india-pakistan-indus-waters-treaty.html" title="">disrupt the flow of a major river</a> system that supplies it with water.</p><p>In Kashmir, Indian forces began a sweeping clampdown, arresting hundreds, as they continued their hunt for the perpetrators. And India and Pakistan have repeatedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir.html" title="">exchanged small-arms fire along the border in the days after the attack</a>.</p><p>But the strikes by India are an intensification of the conflict that runs the risk of setting off an all-out war that could be difficult to contain. The Pakistani government earlier vowed to respond in kind to any Indian aggression, and both nations have the capacity to inflict tremendous damage.</p><p>Anupreeta Das<!-- --> and <!-- -->Hari Kumar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
