She added that “not a single one of these aliens asserted fear of returning to their home country at any point during processing or custody.”</p><p>“The U.S. government coordinated for the welfare of these aliens to also be managed by humanitarian groups in Panama,” she said.</p><p>Since taking office, Mr. Trump has sent hundreds of migrants from around the world to Panama, Costa Rica and El Salvador, though it is unclear if the U.S. government plans to continue doing so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Whether there will be more planes from the United States or not, I honestly don’t know,” Panama’s president, Raúl Mulino, said this month. “I’m not very inclined to do it, because they leave us with the problem.”</p><p>Those now stranded in Panama include Hedayatullah Zazai, 34, a man who said he had served as an officer in the Afghan Army, working alongside U.S. Special Forces and American consultants. After the Taliban took over, he fled to Pakistan, he said, then Iran, then flew to Brazil and trekked through South and Central America to get to the U.S. border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hedayatullah Zazai said he had served as an officer in the Afghan Army, working alongside U.S. Special Forces. “I feel betrayed,” he said. “After years of working with American forces, I am now in a worse situation than when I first escaped Afghanistan.”</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Zazai showing a picture of what he said was an eye injury he sustained in a shootout with the Taliban.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The deportees also include Iranian Christians who said they were under threat at home, and several Afghan women from the Hazara ethnic minority who say they face persecution under the Taliban.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Another deportee is Simegnat, 37, an Amhara woman traveling alone from Ethiopia who said she had been targeted by her government because her ethnicity led the authorities to suspect her of working with a rebel group.

As the only sibling over 18, she was separated from them, detained and flown to Panama, she said.</p><p>Some said they owed hundreds or thousands of dollars to people who helped them fund their journeys.</p><p>“If I go back to Ethiopia without their money,” Simegnat said, “they would kill me.”</p><p>Panama has given the deportees 30-day permits that allow them to stay in the country for the time being and has given them the option of extending their stay to 90 days.</p><p>While Panama has an asylum program, migrants have received mixed messages about the likelihood of receiving long-term legal protections in the country, they said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Another option is for individuals to find another country that will take them. But that would require a case-by-case legal effort, said Silvia Serna, a lawyer who is part of the team that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/world/americas/panama-migrants-us-lawsuit.html" title="">filed a lawsuit</a> that called Panama’s detention of the migrants at the hotel and border camp illegal.</p><p>Ms. Serna said she had been interviewing the migrants to see what assistance her team could offer but cautioned that it might be very hard for people to find welcoming countries.</p><p>In interviews, three of the Iranian deportees said they planned to turn around and head back to the United States and were already negotiating with a smuggler. A fourth had already left for the U.S. border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A shelter in Panama City.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elham Ghaedizadeh, an Iranian who has converted to Christianity, in a church in Panama City.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>One is Negin, 24, who identified herself as a gay woman from Iran, where openly gay people face government persecution. “At least if I’m lingering idly,” she said, “I’ll be inside an American detention camp and on American soil.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The smuggler quoted one woman a price of $5,000 to get her across the U.S.-Mexico border in Tijuana, and $8,000 to secure her a visa and put her on a plane to Canada.</p><p>For now, most of the group is staying at a school gymnasium-turned-shelter outside Panama City run by two Christian charities. The migrants sleep on thin mattresses and eat meals from plastic foam containers. A group of them went door to door at various embassies this past week asking for help but said they had been rejected at every one.</p><p>Elías Cornejo, who works with one of the aid groups, Fe y Alegría, was unsparing in his criticism of the new U.S. administration.</p><p>“We think that the policies of the Trump administration are part of a machine that grinds the migrant like meat,” he said. “And that obviously is a serious problem of inhumanity.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>A smaller group of deportees, mostly families with children, has been staying at a hotel in Panama City paid for by UNICEF. Among them is a married couple, Mohammad and Mona, who are Christian converts from Iran.

Ms. Ghasemzadeh <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/middleeast/this-christian-convert-fled-iran-and-ran-into-trumps-deportation-policy.html" title="">became something of a leader</a> of the group after she posted a video online from detention at the Panama City hotel, pleading with the world for help.</p><p>She said that a priest had offered the migrants group housing north of Panama City, where they would be welcome to stay as long as they were in the country. The houses have kitchens, and they would have no curfew, she added. She was mulling over the offer.</p><p>“I don’t know what will happen next,” Ms. Ghasemzadeh said. “I don’t know my next step.
