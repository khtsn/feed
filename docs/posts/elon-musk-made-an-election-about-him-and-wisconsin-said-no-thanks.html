The voters had other ideas.</p><p>Musk and his related groups dropped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">more than $20 million</a> on boosting the conservative candidate, the former state attorney general Brad Schimel. (Those <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wisconsin-supreme-court-rejects-effort-block-musks-1m/story?id=120319945" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1 million sweepstakes giveaways</a> were especially shameless.) Musk held a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-wisconsin-rally-brad-schimel-rcna198801" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">town hall/rally</a> in Green Bay on Sunday in which he urged folks to back Schimel, and he <a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court-race-green-bay-visit-million-dollar-checks" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pitched</a> the race as “one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.”</p><p>In helping make this likely the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/29/politics/ad-spending-wisconsin-election-dg/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most expensive</a> court contest of all time, Musk also turned it into a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/key-races-wisconsin-florida-what-to-know-elections-rcna198082" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">referendum</a> on himself and his role in the Trump administration. Schimel, bless his heart, could have been the greatest candidate in the history of democracy — he wasn’t — and it wouldn’t have mattered. This became <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">all about Elon</a>, with a dash of Donald Trump thrown in.</p><p>Wisconsinites’ response: No, thanks, bruh. Despite Musk’s hysterical warnings and cheesehead preening, Schimel’s opponent, Susan Crawford, won by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/01/us/elections/results-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">about 10</a> points, securing the court’s liberal majority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Democrats, desperate for a win, are delighted. But Republicans should be quietly rejoicing as well — especially the members of Congress <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/republicans-doge-musk-trump/682042/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increasingly unsettled</a> by the unelected billionaire clumsily hacking at government programs that Americans rely on. So many scared and angry constituents. So many fractious town halls. So much electoral peril.</p><p>Musk has his money-drenched tentacles wrapped tightly around the president. To start disentangling him and moving him toward the door, Republican lawmakers need to make the case that he is hurting Trump’s popularity — and threatening the G.O.P.’s unified control of Washington. Musk’s expensive Wisconsin flop is a big, red warning flag for Republican members to wave. They’d be wise to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/01/special-elections-elon-musk-trump-weakness-00262007" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seize the moment</a> while this failure is raw, missing no opportunity to remind the president what a political loser his buddy is turning out to be.</p><p>Waiting will only make the situation worse. DOGE is just getting warmed up. There’s no telling how much more damage Musk will do — to the nation and to the Republican Party — by the time a smattering of elections are decided this November. The mass layoffs of federal workers are already expected to damage Republicans’ fortunes in the Virginia governor’s race, seen as a key political bellwether.</p><p>And by next year’s midterms? Let’s just say voters can go from adoring to bloodthirsty in a flash when folks start messing with their Social Security and Medicaid.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michelle Cottle writes about national politics for Opinion.
