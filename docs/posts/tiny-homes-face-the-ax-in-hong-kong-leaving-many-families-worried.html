Jars of chili oil were precariously balanced on water pipes. A stew of chicken wings and chestnuts warmed on an electric stove a few feet from the shower faucet.</p><p>She and her 12-year-old daughter are among 220,000 people in Hong Kong living in subdivided homes, which have long been among the starkest examples of the city’s vast income inequality.</p><p>Now her home is under threat. Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee, last month announced that the city would impose minimum standards on the size and fixtures of such apartments. The policy is expected to phase out more than 30,000 of the smallest subdivided homes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In Ms. Liu’s home, there was no space for a sink; the only spot for two pet turtles was in a basin under the fridge. “If we had money, these would be in separate rooms,” she said, looking at the cluttered kitchen and toilet. </p><p>Beijing has urged the Hong Kong government to get rid of subdivided units and other tiny homes by 2049, because it regards the city’s housing shortage as one cause of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-photos.html" title="">the antigovernment unrest of 2019</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The new rules will not address living conditions in so-called coffin homes or cage homes like this one, which are the smallest housing units in Hong Kong.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Billy H.C.

It also doesn’t address the worst types of housing in the city: rental bed spaces so small they are known as coffin, or cage, homes.</p><h3 id="link-3a1462ae"><span>Of Slums and Slumlords</span></h3><p>Hong Kong’s subdivided homes, created when apartments are carved into two or more units, are usually in old tenement buildings in densely packed, working-class neighborhoods. Despite their often dilapidated conditions, the units are in high demand because affordable housing is in short supply.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Hong Kong has among the world’s most expensive homes, and highest rents. The average living space per person is 64.6 square feet — less than half the size of a New York City parking space. Owners of tenement apartments partition the units into smaller ones to rent them to more people.</p><p>“These are effectively slums and the landlords are slumlords,” said Brian Wong, a researcher at the Liber Research Community, an independent group in Hong Kong focused on land use and urban issues.</p><p>He added that the landlords who rent out subdivided units are often upper-middle-class residents looking to maximize profits. Paradoxically, the rent price of such units, on a per-square-foot basis, is usually <a href="https://urbanstudies.cuhk.edu.hk/news/view/average-monthly-rent-per-square-foot-for-subdivided-flats-in-hong-kong-shockingly-higher-than-that-for-private-housing-survey-finds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">higher than that of larger private apartments</a>.</p><p>Ms. Liu pays $500 a month for her home of about 80 square feet, about a quarter of what she earns working at a construction site. Her unit is in a 60-year-old tenement building with peeling pink and yellow paint in Kwun Tong, a district in east Kowloon that was once an industrial heartland, with cotton mills and a soy sauce factory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kwun Tong is the most densely populated district in Hong Kong, and the poorest.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Billy H.C.

She has been waiting for six years to move into public housing but has no idea when that might happen.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Liu and her daughter sleep on bunk beds in the 60-square-foot main room, pushed against windows that are covered with paper for privacy and always closed to keep rats out. Ms. Liu appreciates that her neighbors don’t complain when her belongings spill into common spaces.</p><p>Kwun Tong is the most densely populated district in Hong Kong, and the poorest. People are drawn to it for its connectivity and services. Ms. Liu moved there six years ago to take a housekeeping course. Her daughter rides two stops on the subway to attend public school and studies with a tutor nearby until dinnertime. Their apartment is close to a large wet market.</p><h3 id="link-62097759"><span>The Hong Kong Leader’s Plan</span></h3><p>Ms. Liu’s home would not meet the standards required under the policy outlined by Mr. Lee, the city’s chief executive, which stipulates that each home must have a separate bathroom and kitchen. It would likely require significant renovation or remodeling.</p><p>The policy also calls for apartments to be at least 86 square feet and come with windows.</p><p>Ms. Liu’s bathroom and stove are in a narrow cubicle that is slightly more than 20 square feet, separated from the main room by a common hallway. There is one faucet but no shower cubicle or sink, so she soaks ingredients in a bowl on the floor. The fridge faces the toilet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Liu’s bathroom and stove are in a small, narrow cubicle separated from the main room by a common hallway. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Billy H.C.

Some apartments come only with toilets or kitchens that are shared with other households.</p><p>The government estimates that 30 percent of the city’s 110,000 subdivided homes will fall short of the new standards.</p><p>The Housing Bureau said in a response to questions from The New York Times that the rules were needed to improve living conditions. It said it would inspect apartments and that landlords could face prison time for not complying with the rules.</p><p>The bureau also said that landlords would have a few years to renovate their units to meet the standards, and register them in a centralized system.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h3 id="link-96bd966"><span>Plan Leaves Much to be Desired</span></h3><p>At a recent meeting between social workers with the Kwun Tong Subdivided Home Concern Group, a nonprofit, and residents of the district, questions were raised about the government’s plan. What are the standards for a proper toilet? If rents go up, will the government provide tenants with subsidies? Will those evicted be given priority in housing wait-lists?</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volunteers gathering food to distribute to cage homes in another Hong Kong neighborhood, Sham Shui Po.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Billy H.C.

She also wondered what would happen to people if they were evicted. “If they had money, they would have rented a more expensive space in the first place,” she said. “Where do they go?”</p><p>In its emailed response to questions, the Housing Bureau said the government would “adopt a gradual and orderly approach” to the changes and would help residents “where necessary.” Most affected tenants would be able to turn to an increased supply of permanent and temporary public housing apartments by the time the rules come into force in the coming years, it said.</p><p>Experts note, however, that the new policy also fails to address problems faced by those living in “cage homes” or “coffin homes” — bed spaces separated by wired metal or panels of wood. (Such spaces are regulated by a separate law.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Resting in a rooftop cage home in Sham Shui Po.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Billy H.C.
