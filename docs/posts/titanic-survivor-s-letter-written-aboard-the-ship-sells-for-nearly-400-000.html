Archibald Gracie, described the vessel in a letter written while on board: “It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey’s end before I pass judgment on her.”</p><p>Colonel Gracie’s journey on the Titanic had a catastrophic end, but he fared better than most.</p><p>He was on the top deck of the ship, gripping a railing, as it plunged into the sea. He said he was “swirled” under water before he got to a raft, where he spent hours floating on icy waters before being rescued.</p><p>The letter he wrote was sold on Saturday at an auction for $399,000 (or 300,000 pounds), according to Henry Aldridge and Son, an auction house in Wiltshire, England.</p><p><a href="https://www.easyliveauction.com/catalogue/lot/65597cc54d0c7e83eae0ab0518a00d82/0af8d24542e81eb9357e7ef448a6646f/auction-of-titanic-white-star-and-transport-memorabili-lot-301/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The auction house said</a> the letter, written in neat, cursive handwriting, was addressed to an unidentified European ambassador, the great-uncle of the seller. The letterhead shows a triangular red flag with a white star and is printed with the words “On board R.M.S. Titanic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The letter was dated April 10, 1912, the day the ship set sail from Southampton, England. On April 12, it was postmarked in London, where it was received at the Waldorf Hotel. The Titanic struck an iceberg just before midnight on April 14 and sank the next day.</p><p>The buyer of the letter was based in the United States, according to Andrew Aldridge, the managing director of Henry Aldridge and Son. The auction house did not publicly identify the buyer or the seller.</p><p>Mr. Aldridge said in an email that the stories of the ship’s passengers “are told through the memorabilia” and that “their memories are kept alive through those items.”</p><p>The auction house had initially expected the letter <a href="https://www.henryaldridge.com/about-us/news/gracie-letter-april-25/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to sell for up to 60,000 pounds, or nearly $80,000.</a></p><p>Colonel Gracie, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, was a high-profile survivor of the Titanic disaster, in which about 1,500 people perished.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He died eight months later, <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/12/05/100562458.html?pageNumber=1" title="">in December 1912</a>, of complications from diseases, but his doctors and his family said that the real cause was that he had never recovered from the shock of the Titanic disaster, according to The New York Times.</p><p>After Colonel Gracie was rescued, he began work on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Truth-About-Titanic-Archibald-Gracie/dp/3849675475/ref=asc_df_3849675475?mcid=c714a64aeae738fdb68b00a1fac84d0f&amp;hvocijid=10495497102285767064-3849675475-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=10495497102285767064&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9007066&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435177378&amp;psc=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“The Truth About the Titanic,”</a> a book about his experience that was published posthumously. The New York Times <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/05/04/100617342.html?pageNumber=30" title="">review of the book</a> said “there is something effective in the very lack of directness and coherency in the narrative.”</p><p>Colonel Gracie said in an interview with <a href="https://titanicarchive.org/collections/newspapers/colonel-archibald-gracie/colonel-archibald-gracies-new-york-tribune-account" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The New York Tribune</a> that he had been on the top deck of the ship when it was hit by a wave that sent other people overboard. He managed to stay on and grabbed a brass railing.</p><p>“When the ship plunged down, I was forced to let go, and I was swirled around and around for what seemed an interminable time,” he said. “Eventually I came to the surface to find the sea a mass of tangled wreckage.”</p><p>He said he grabbed a wooden grating and then saw a canvas-and-cork raft. He made it onto the raft and began trying to rescue others. They eventually reached a rescue ship, R.M.S. Carpathia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>“The hours that elapsed before we were picked up by the Carpathia were the longest and most terrible that I ever spent,” Colonel Gracie said, according to The Tribune. “Practically without any sensation of feeling because of the icy water, we were almost dropping from fatigue.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The letter sold at auction on Saturday for nearly $400,000 or 300,000 pounds. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Henry Aldridge &amp; Son</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Colonel Gracie was an established figure in New York and Washington society.</p><p>His father had been an officer in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
