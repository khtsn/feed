The promise of salvation from Portuguese colonizers, and a life with jobs and housing for all, was an easy sell in a southern African nation that was suffering under racist rule.</p><p>But when Daniel Chapo of Frelimo becomes president on Wednesday, he will confront a country more dissatisfied with his party than at any point during the country’s 50 years of independence. Tens of thousands of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/world/africa/mozambique-protests-election.html" title="">took to the street</a> after the October election, which voters, international observers, opposition leaders and rights groups have roundly criticized as fraudulent.</p><p>The country of 33 million has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/africa/mozambique-unrest-news.html" title="">roiled by political chaos</a> since the vote.
