    <h1>Riot announces finalized details for VCT Ascension Pacific</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<p>article is a little bit misleading: &#34;Teams from the Singapore/Malaysia region and the Japan region also received byes as BLEED and SCARZ were the finalists from both regions last year.&#34;</p>
<p>while those teams have the &#34;top 2 seeds&#34; there are actually 6 teams getting byes, not just 2</p>
<p>the main distinction that the top 2 seeds get is that if they lose their first match they go to lower round 2 instead of lower round 1</p>
<p>also for anyone confused about how seeding was done, the 4 regions that didn&#39;t qualify out of groups in ascension last year were Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, and India, so those 4 regions were seeded as the bottom 4 in this year&#39;s Ascension</p>
<p>I do agree that doing a standard group stage format like last year is way better but if they are going to do 10 team double elim then this is probably the most &#34;fair&#34; way to seed it, since there&#39;s really no other way to do so.</p>		</div></div>
