    <h1>Affirmative Action News Is Coming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling last year upended admissions at selective colleges. Because they could no longer consider race, admissions officers — with oversight from their lawyers — had to overhaul their processes.</p><p>In coming weeks, we will learn about the results. With students back on campus, more colleges will report the racial makeup of their freshman classes. The colleges already have the data; they just haven’t yet announced it (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/mit-black-latino-enrollment-affirmative-action.html" title="">with the exception of M.I.T.</a>).</p><p>I’ve spoken frequently with university administrators about this subject in recent months. Today, I’ll offer a preview of the post-affirmative action landscape, organized around four points.</p><h2 id="link-582e7df">1. Variation is likely</h2><p>Because M.I.T. reported its results first and experienced a sharp drop in Black and Latino students, it may be natural to assume that M.I.T. will be the norm. I’m not sure it will be, though.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>M.I.T. isn’t a typical elite college. It focuses on STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — an area where Black and Latino underrepresentation is stark. M.I.T.’s recent announcement also contained a statistical anomaly that may have exaggerated the decline in Black and Latino students (as I explain below).</p><p>As more colleges report data, people inside higher education expect a wide variety of outcomes. Some colleges will probably have big declines. Others may have only modest changes.</p><h2 id="link-37cca78">2. Diversity isn’t cheating</h2><p>Many conservatives are worried that colleges will cheat by continuing to consider race. Admissions decisions, after all, are subjective, and colleges often know an applicant’s race even though there is no longer a box to check. An article in The Atlantic last year even urged universities <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/affirmative-action-race-socioeconomic-supreme-court/674251/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to defy the Supreme Court</a>.</p><p>But it would be a mistake to conclude that any college that maintains high diversity levels has broken the law.</p><p>The court’s decision explicitly allows colleges to weigh the effects of race. “Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. The key, Roberts added, was that the student “must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Remember, there are huge racial gaps in the U.S. — in health, wealth, school resources, incarceration and more. Any college that truly accounted for socioeconomic disadvantage, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/07/magazine/duke-economic-diversity.html" title="">as more now promise to do</a>, would end up giving credit for overcoming adversity to many underrepresented minorities. That wouldn’t be breaking the law; it would be following Roberts’s orders.</p><p>Of course, it’s plausible that some colleges did cheat and secretly gave extra credit for race itself. The distinction is likely to be the subject of future lawsuits.</p><h2 id="link-5f15bcb9">3. Class isn’t race</h2><p>There was a detail in the numbers <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/qa-undergraduate-admissions-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling-0821" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">M.I.T. released last week</a> that might seem surprising: Even as Black and Latino representation in this year’s entering class fell sharply, the number of lower-income students rose modestly. About one quarter of M.I.T.’s first-year students come from the bottom half of the U.S. income distribution.</p><p>Together, this data suggests that the Supreme Court’s decision may have most hurt upper-income Black and Latino applicants at M.I.T. — and most benefited lower-income Asian applicants. (The number of Asian students rose significantly.)</p><p>I’ll leave it to others to argue about whether this combination is good, bad or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/briefing/affirmative-action.html" title="">some of each</a>. It’s certainly complicated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-f55dadb">4. The 120% anomaly</h2><p>M.I.T., like many colleges, allows students to identify as having more than one race. As a result, its racial categories add up to more than 100 percent; any mixed-race student — both Black and Asian, say — counts in both categories.</p><p>Still, there was a strange pattern in M.I.T.’s data. The number of mixed-race freshmen this fall plunged compared with previous years, as you can see from these numbers:</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>How could this be? There are two leading possibilities.</p><p>First, a disproportionate number of the upper-income minority students whom M.I.T. didn’t admit this year may have been multiracial. Mixed-race families are increasingly common in well-off high schools. When these students were admitted in the past, they were counted twice in the data. And each one who no longer enrolls looks like two students in the data.</p><p>Second, the timing of M.I.T.’s data collection changed this year in a notable way. In the past, M.I.T. asked students to list their race <em>when applying</em>. This year, it asked about race only after students <em>decided to enroll</em>. It’s possible, then, that students who had a real claim on being a minority but didn’t identify strongly with that group — a white student with one parent from Argentina, say, or a multiracial student with some African heritage — might have been less likely to identify as Black or Latino this year than last year, when race-based affirmative action existed.</p><p>The numbers suggest that this anomaly might explain fully half the decline in underrepresented minorities. Regardless, the Black and Latino shares fell significantly, but the drop was probably smaller than the top-line data suggests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-7a26f15c">The bottom line</h2><p>If the overall number of Black and Latino students at selective colleges plummets this year, it will be cause for consternation. It would aggravate racial inequality because these colleges provide <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/collegeadmissions/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">big economic benefits</a> and have an outsize role in shaping the American elite. For now, the full picture remains uncertain. As we get more information, I’ll update you.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><p>The Harris Interview</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">CNN</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><ul><li><p>Kamala Harris, in her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/29/us/harris-trump-election" title="">first major TV interview</a> since becoming the Democratic nominee, defended President Biden’s record.
