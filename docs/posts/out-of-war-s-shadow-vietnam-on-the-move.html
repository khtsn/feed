But it was also a bloody conflict over economic systems and cultures — the North’s revolutionary socialism versus the South’s freewheeling market scramble.</p><p>A half-century later, ideology is mostly dead and pragmatism is thriving. Vietnam has moved in a single lifetime from war to peace, rural to increasingly urban, poor to roughly middle-class, and explicitly Communist to a complex hybrid of free markets and state control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Major multinationals (Nike, Samsung, Apple and others) have made Vietnam an export hub. The country, which liberalized its economy in the late 1980s, has been pushing toward higher-tech manufacturing and income levels closer to those of richer nations in Asia.</p><p>But the Vietnam model — mixing youthful workers, massive factories, flexible diplomacy and open markets for its exports — now faces a more hostile world.</p><p>The U.S.-China trade war is injecting uncertainty into a system that has hugely benefited Vietnam, freezing investment and slashing projections of economic growth. And the disruption comes at a terrible time — in the last decade of Vietnam’s “demographic dividend,” before the population rapidly ages.</p><p>And yet, for a resilient nation that is more windshield than rearview mirror, hope is always just up the road. Vietnam regularly <a href="https://www.gallup-international.com/survey-results-and-news/survey-result/not-much-of-a-free-world-but-at-least-optimistic" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tops rankings</a> of the most optimistic countries, and according to many Vietnamese, it’s for good reason.</p><p>As recently as the 1990s, most were poor. Now <a href="https://www.adb.org/where-we-work/viet-nam/poverty#:~:text=Poverty%20Data%3A%20Viet%20Nam&amp;text=In%20Viet%20Nam%2C%203.4%25%20of,died%20before%20their%205th%20birthday." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less than 4 percent</a> of the population lives below what the World Bank considers the national poverty line, earning less than $3.65 a day. Per capita annual income has jumped more than sixfold, to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/vietnam/overview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roughly $4,500</a>, since 2000 — and everyone who can seems eager to join the world’s social media stream, whether it’s with fashion, food or hip-hop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/00vid-int-young-vietnam-27405-cover/00vid-int-young-vietnam-27405-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/00vid-int-young-vietnam-27405-cover/00vid-int-young-vietnam-27405-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/23/138198_1_00vid-int-young-vietnam-27405_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">A hip-hop showdown event in Ho Chi Minh City.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Nothing defines Vietnam more right now than the desire to be seen anew, to have Vietnam and its people recognized for their strengths. That urge has produced a potent and paternalistic nationalism. Factional struggles in the ruling elite sometimes open space for targeted critiques (of corruption, for example). But mild questioning of the system in art, books, religion and online still draws police repression.</p><p>Ambition is the focal point, for the government, too. Communist Party leaders recently launched a bold plan to consolidate provinces, merge ministries and cut the public work force by a third.</p><p>The goal is to move fast, and that drive for achievement is especially visible in classrooms.</p><p>At the Tan Phu Secondary School in Ho Chi Minh City, a private school that is part of a for-profit network emphasizing <a href="https://igc.edu.vn/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">global citizenship</a>, the physics club is especially popular.</p><p>The school day runs from 7:20 a.m. to 4:50 p.m. The stairs display quotes in English like “leadership is a choice not a position.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A decade ago, Tan Phu was one of just a few private schools in the district. Now there are 58. And all over Vietnam, bright high schoolers are pushing for, and expecting, upward mobility.</p><p>The students at Tan Phu are mostly the offspring of shop owners, office workers or factory managers. Ask these teenagers what they want, and nearly all will say studying abroad. Many pull it off.</p><p>In 2000, Vietnam sent around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/13/world/vietnam-finds-an-old-foe-has-a-new-allure.html" title="">1,300 students</a> to further their education in the United States; last year, American universities <a href="https://en.vietnamplus.vn/vietnam-leads-asean-in-number-of-students-studying-in-us-post304572.vnp#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20Vietnamese%20students,in%20the%20country%20exceeds%2031%2C000." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">welcomed 22,000</a>.

More than a million Vietnamese <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/and-vietnamese-refugees-are-still-fleeing.html" title="">fled on boats</a> in the 1970s and early ’80s.</p><p>For those who recall that era, the opportunities of the present feel profound — and they must be seized, as if they offer a way to paint over one Vietnam with another. The postwar generations have something to prove: that their homeland is much more than war and refugees.</p><p>“Vietnam can get along with all the other developed nations,” said Le Tra My, 39, Tan Phu’s vice principal and a mother of three. “We want to show them the capabilities of the Vietnamese people.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-17"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="young-vietnam-scrolly-1" data-id="100000010129062" data-source-id="100000010129062"><div slug="young-vietnam-scrolly-1" data-sourceid="100000010129062" id="embed-id-100000010129062">

This is still a one-party state where dissent can lead to prison.</p><p>Vietnam is not China, with its censored internet and sophisticated systems of heavy policing.

Companies are having to venture further afield to find workers, which drives up costs in a time of intense international competition, and may hinder Vietnam’s future growth.</p><p>In 1946, Vietnam’s most famous revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh, <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1946/07/06/93133226.html?pageNumber=4" title="">told The New York Times</a> that economic independence would be harder for Vietnam to obtain than political independence. And it’s still true.</p><p>The question for the 50 years ahead has become more urgent: What comes next?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Inside the dorms of My Dien, there are now more workers like Phan Van Du, who at 40 would have been considered too old for a factory job just a few years ago. When a recruiter showed up in his village in 2023, he said he immediately agreed to work with Foxconn, a major Apple supplier.</p><p>In a good month, working 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. with some extra shifts, he said he earned about 11 million dong, or $430, slightly more than the national average.</p><p>“For me, I think it’s been worth it,” he said. But he wants his 15-year-old son to aim higher.</p><p>“I hope he’ll study and do better and be an engineer, but it’s hard,” he said. “I don’t know if he’ll be able to do it.”</p><p>The hope, for many in Vietnam, is that the war and all its concomitant struggles will fade into the oblivion of prosperity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-39"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Above, Nguyen Ngoc Phuong, left, and Matthew Keenan, a U.S. veteran, became friends at a support center for Agent Orange victims in Da Nang.

The narrative of revolutionary victory has stifled discussions about the pain of Vietnamese killing Vietnamese, and the cruelty that followed the North’s victory, with camps and discrimination.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.vietnam.vn/en/bai-viet-cua-tong-bi-thu-to-lam-va-thong-diep-ve-hoa-hop-dan-toc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">essay</a> published on Sunday, Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam, became the first party chief to acknowledge that national reconciliation could come only with “accepting different perspectives.” He said he was inspired by conversations with overseas Vietnamese, including those who “once belonged to the ‘other side.’”</p><p>The hard work of unification remains. Thousands of families from the North and South are still looking for the bodies of relatives lost in the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>America’s military tactics linger. Nguyen Ngoc Phuong, 45, whose father was exposed to Agent Orange near Da Nang, leading him and his sister to be born with physical deformities, told us he wished more young people recognized that the war’s toll is never far — and that grit clears a path for dreams.</p><p>“Without yesterday, we don’t have today,” he said. “Without the suffering of people who endured the war, there’s no peace.”</p><p>Peace, however, is not just the absence of combat.</p><p>Phan Duong Hung Tam, 57, runs a business making women’s dresses for American brands. One of his factories is in Dong Nai Province, outside Ho Chi Minh City. In a recent visit, Mr. Tam told us that finding peace of mind was harder now as costs rose and orders shrank.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-45"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fashion has become more important in Hanoi, above.

His father was a senior military officer for the South in Da Nang near a U.S. base.</p><p>As a result, he said: “My life before ’75 was going pretty well. I was 6 or 7, and we wanted for nothing.”</p><p>After the war, his family moved around and struggled with being kept out of good jobs because of their Southern connections. In 1987, his father fled by boat, taking Mr. Tam’s siblings with him. He returned only in 2003, when he was ill and ready to die.</p><p>Mr. Tam sighed after recounting his family’s breakup and the switchbacks in fortune — which included success with an apparel boom 25 years ago, and a son studying dentistry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-47"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/00vid-int-young-vietnam-72957-cover/00vid-int-young-vietnam-72957-cover-superJumbo.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/23/00vid-int-young-vietnam-72957-cover/00vid-int-young-vietnam-72957-cover-superJumbo.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/23/138197_1_00vid-int-young-vietnam-72957_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Workers in Phan Duong Hung Tam’s factory in Dong Nai Province making women’s dresses.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>As the sun set, we asked a final question: Do you feel better off than you did 50 years ago?</p><p>He leaned back in his chair.
