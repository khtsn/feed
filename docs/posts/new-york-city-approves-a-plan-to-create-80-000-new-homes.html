The number of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/nyregion/homelessness-streets-subways-nyc.html" title="">homeless New Yorkers has risen</a>, and roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/nyregion/new-york-city-homeless-children.html" title="">one in eight public school students were homeless</a> last year. Roughly 500,000 households spend at least half of their income on rent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New York City rents have soared and the housing vacancy rate is at its lowest level in decades, making it difficult for average families to find a place to live.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dave Sanders for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Opposition was fierce in neighborhoods on Staten Island and in Queens that have many single-family homes, with residents objecting to the prospect of new high-rise apartments.</p><p>Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University, praised leaders for reaching a compromise and said that the city needed to build housing, especially near subway stations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We’ve had a lost decade of housing development in New York City, and this is the start of changing that,” he said. “We have to keep going.”</p><p>The Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, urged members to focus on what was best for the city — not just for their districts — at a moment when the high cost of living is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/nyregion/black-residents-nyc.html" title="">pushing many families to move away</a>.</p><p>“This Council cannot be the body that says no to people who need a place to live,” Ms. Adams said in a passionate speech in the Council chambers before the vote, adding: “We cannot do nothing.”</p><p>The mayor celebrated the victory at a City Hall rally on Thursday evening with Gov. Kathy Hochul, who committed $1 billion in state funding to help secure a deal. Pointing to a diorama of new apartments built over a deli and a salon, Mayor Adams said the plan would help lower rents for New Yorkers.</p><p>“We showed the nation that government can still be bold and brave by passing the most pro-housing piece of legislation in city history,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mayor Adams, who is running for re-election, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/nyregion/nyc-eric-adams-poll.html" title="">record-low approval ratings</a> and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted.html" title="">indicted in September</a> on federal corruption charges.</p><p>He was largely absent from the push to get the plan approved. Instead, he relied on two allies: Dan Garodnick, the director of the Department of City Planning, and Maria Torres-Springer, his first deputy mayor.</p><p>Tensions flared during the negotiations between Mayor Adams and Ms. Adams, who are not related. Ms. Adams did not join the mayor’s victory rally. She thanked Ms. Hochul and Mr. Garodnick ahead of the vote without saying anything positive about the mayor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker, had pushed for additional funding for affordable housing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J.

He proposed a “Mega Midtown” plan to increase density with mixed-income rental towers in that area of Manhattan.</p><p>“The passage of City of Yes is a step in the right direction; now it’s time to start running,” he said.</p><p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/nyregion/new-york-city-broker-fee-city-council.html" title="">Council approved a bill</a> to shift expensive broker fees to landlords, another effort to address high housing costs. Mayor Adams said this week that he would not veto the bill despite his concerns that it could prompt landlords to raise monthly rents.</p><p>“I don’t want to put New Yorkers through distress and strife,” he said of his past battles with City Council leaders.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On Thursday, the City Council also approved Muriel Goode-Trufant as the city’s corporation counsel after the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/726-24/mayor-adams-the-intention-nominate-muriel-goode-trufant-serve-new-york-city-s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mayor nominated her</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/nyregion/randy-mastro-eric-adams-lawyer-withdraws.html" title="">Council had rejected a previous effort</a> by Mayor Adams to name Randy Mastro, a former aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, to the job.</p><p>The housing plan is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/nyregion/nyc-city-of-yes-zoning-proposals-housing-manufacturing.html" title="">third part of a broader proposal</a> to update the city’s archaic zoning rules. The Council already approved two other measures to prepare the city for climate change and to create new rules to support businesses.</p><p>The plan <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/land-use/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2024/11/Parking-Mods-11-21-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creates three zones for parking mandates</a>, removing them — or reducing them significantly — in certain areas and keeping them in areas that have fewer public transit options. Many new developments, including affordable housing and homes near transit hubs, would no longer be required to provide parking.</p><p>The rules would also make it easier to build backyard cottages and basement apartments. And they would give developers an option to build bigger buildings than they currently can, if they include apartments available only to lower- or moderate-income residents or those who are struggling with homelessness.</p><p>David Carr, a Republican council member from Staten Island, voted against the plan on Thursday, arguing that the environmental effects had not been properly studied.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I believe that this text amendment will not survive a legal challenge, and one is likely to be forthcoming,” he said.</p><p>Some Democrats from neighborhoods outside Manhattan voted against the plan, including Lynn Schulman, who represents Forest Hills in Queens. She said she was worried it was being rushed and would damage the city.</p><p>“I heard very loud the voices of my constituents,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
