The number of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/nyregion/homelessness-streets-subways-nyc.html" title="">homeless New Yorkers has risen</a>, and roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/nyregion/new-york-city-homeless-children.html" title="">one in eight public school students were homeless</a> last year. About 500,000 households spend at least half of their income on rent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mayor Adams, a Democrat, and his administration won over skeptical lawmakers by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/nyregion/housing-city-yes-nyc.html" title="">agreeing to spend an additional $5 billion</a> on affordable housing and infrastructure projects and by scaling back some of the boldest proposals.</p><p>The goal is to build “<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/692-23/mayor-adams-launches-historic-effort-build-a-little-more-housing-every-neighborhood-" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a little more housing in every neighborhood</a>” by changing rules around parking mandates for new construction and adding homes above stores and in basements. Opposition was fierce in neighborhoods on Staten Island and in Queens that have many single-family homes, with residents objecting to the prospect of new high-rise apartments.</p><p>Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University, praised leaders for reaching a compromise and said that the city needed to build housing, especially near subway stations.</p><p>“We’ve had a lost decade of housing development in New York City, and this is the start of changing that,” he said. “We have to keep going.”</p><p>The Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, had urged members to focus on what was best for the city — not just for their districts — at a moment when the high cost of living is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/nyregion/black-residents-nyc.html" title="">pushing many families to move away</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“Our conversations have been to encourage our colleagues to please take an expansive view,” Ms. Adams said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker, had pushed for additional funding for affordable housing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Victor J. Blue for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Adams, who has a tense relationship with the mayor (they are not related), had pushed for the additional funding, which included $1 billion from the state. The <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/press/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2024/11/City-for-All-Commitments.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deal sets aside $2 billion for affordable housing</a>; $2 billion for infrastructure projects, including sewer upgrades; and $1 billion for public housing, vouchers, tenant protections and other measures.</p><p>Mayor Adams said in a statement on Thursday that he hoped the plan would lead to lower rents for New Yorkers.</p><p>“We showed the nation that government can still be bold and brave by passing the most pro-housing piece of legislation in city history,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The mayor, who is running for re-election, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/nyregion/nyc-eric-adams-poll.html" title="">record-low approval ratings</a> and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted.html" title="">indicted in September</a> on federal corruption charges.</p><p>Many housing experts and elected officials say that the plan is an important step, but that the city must go further to build more housing quickly.</p><p>Zellnor Myrie, a state senator from Brooklyn who is running for mayor, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/661d72f5fdcd48687fb80031/t/674e6591e53c4b51f570df29/1733191070468/Zellnor+For+NYC+-+Rebuild+NYC+-+One+Million+Homes.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released an ambitious housing plan</a> this week that called for building or preserving one million homes over the next decade. He proposed a “Mega Midtown” plan to increase density with mixed-income rental towers in that area of Manhattan.</p><p>“Our current path of Band-Aids and blinders is a choice to continue pushing New Yorkers out,” Mr. Myrie said.</p><p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/nyregion/new-york-city-broker-fee-city-council.html" title="">Council approved a bill</a> to shift expensive broker fees to landlords, another effort to address high housing costs. Mayor Adams said this week that he would not veto the bill despite his concerns that it could prompt landlords to raise monthly rents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I don’t want to put New Yorkers through distress and strife,” he said of his past battles with City Council leaders.</p><p>The City Council was also expected on Thursday to approve Muriel Goode-Trufant as the city’s corporation counsel after the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/726-24/mayor-adams-the-intention-nominate-muriel-goode-trufant-serve-new-york-city-s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mayor nominated her</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/nyregion/randy-mastro-eric-adams-lawyer-withdraws.html" title="">Council rejected a previous effort</a> by Mayor Adams to name Randy Mastro, a former aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, to the job.</p><p>The housing plan is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/nyregion/nyc-city-of-yes-zoning-proposals-housing-manufacturing.html" title="">third part of a broader proposal</a> to update the city’s archaic zoning rules. The Council already approved two other measures to prepare the city for climate change and to create new rules to support businesses.</p><p>The plan <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/land-use/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2024/11/Parking-Mods-11-21-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creates three zones for parking mandates</a>, removing them — or reducing them significantly — in certain areas and keeping them in areas that have fewer public transit options. Many new developments, including affordable housing and homes near transit hubs, would no longer be required to provide parking.</p><p>The rules would also make it easier to build backyard cottages and basement apartments. And they would give developers an option to build bigger buildings than they currently can, if they include apartments available only to lower- or moderate-income residents or those who are struggling with homelessness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>David Carr, a Republican council member from Staten Island, voted against the plan on Thursday, arguing that the environmental effects had not been properly studied.</p><p>“I believe that this text amendment will not survive a legal challenge and one is likely to be forthcoming,” he said.</p><p>The mayor was largely absent from the push to get the plan approved. Instead, he relied on two allies: Dan Garodnick, the director of the Department of City Planning, and Maria Torres-Springer, his first deputy mayor.</p><p>On the day of a key committee vote last month, Ms. Adams, the Council speaker, said she had not spoken to the mayor that day, but had spoken to Gov. Kathy Hochul, who agreed to contribute state funding to help secure a deal. Ms. Adams thanked Ms. Hochul and Mr. Garodnick on Thursday and notably did not mention the mayor.</p><p>Some Democrats from neighborhoods outside Manhattan opposed the plan. Lynn Schulman, a Democrat who represents Forest Hills in Queens, voted against the measure and said she was worried it was being rushed and would damage the city.</p><p>“I heard very loud the voices of my constituents,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
