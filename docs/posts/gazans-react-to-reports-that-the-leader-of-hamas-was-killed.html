A sample of his DNA was tested to confirm his identity, according to an Israeli official with knowledge of the matter. The police in Israel said they had also used Mr. Sinwar’s dental records and fingerprints, both of which were on file, for identification purposes. There was no immediate response from Hamas.</p><p>Since launching the assault on Hamas in Gaza last October in retaliation for Hamas’s cross-border raids, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 abducted, Israeli officials have repeatedly said that their goal was nothing less than the destruction of the militant group.</p><p>But no target loomed larger for Israel than Mr. Sinwar himself. Over his past year in hiding in the devastated enclave, he was believed to still be closely overseeing Hamas military operations.</p><p>Mr. Sinwar’s death raises hopes for an end to a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of Gazans and plunged many more into a humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel stopped short of declaring total victory against Hamas in a statement, and vowed to get the remaining hostages in Gaza released. He made an offer to those holding hostages, promising to let them “leave and live” if they set aside their weapons and returned the captives.</p><p>His death might encourage Hamas to agree to Israeli demands, and might also offer Israel a military success that could lead the Netanyahu government to ease its negotiating stance. Hamas and the Israeli government have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-year-of-war.html" title="">remained far apart on key issues</a> during months of negotiations over a truce.</p><p><strong>Here’s what else to know:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Identifying the body:</strong> Israeli officials matched Mr. Sinwar’s dental information and fingerprints with records on file, the Israeli police said in a statement. The matches provided “definitive identification” of the Hamas leader, the police said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reaction in Israel:</strong> For the families of the dozens of hostages remaining in Gaza, the death of Mr. Sinwar brought both a moment of satisfaction and deep trepidation for the fate of the captives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hamas leadership:</strong> Mr. Sinwar’s death deals a significant blow to the militant organization’s leadership.

The military said it had killed dozens of fighters in the strike. There were reports that more than 100 people were injured.</p><p>Rescue workers, Palestinian media and at least one civilian who had been living there said the site had housed civilians. Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, the U.N. agency that assists Palestinian refugees, confirmed that one of its schools in Jabaliya was struck on Thursday.</p><p>“We received reports that among the scores of people killed are children, which is often the case,” Ms. Touma said, adding that the school was the third UNRWA site to be attacked in the last week. She said the U.N. had not been able to determine the accuracy of Israel’s claims that Hamas and other groups were active in its school compounds.</p><p>“We call for an independent investigation and commissions of inquiry to look into these reoccurring claims,” she said. “We call once again on all Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, to refrain from using UNRWA facilities for military or fighting purposes.”</p><p>The Gaza government media office said the strike had killed 28 people and injured 160 more. One man who had been staying in the school compound, Mahmoud Hamdouna, 29, said he left the building just minutes before the strike to search for food. He ran back when he heard the explosion and found a scene that was “horrific, a real massacre,” he said.</p><p>“I saw around 25 dead bodies and so many injured,” said Mr. Hamdouna, who had fled to Jabaliya from Beit Hanoun, another town in Gaza’s besieged north. “People lost limbs at the scene and many had serious head injuries. Many others are still under the rubble.”</p><p>Satellite imagery captured three days before the strike showed many tents inside the school’s courtyard.</p><p>Regular schooling has not happened in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war last October. Instead, displaced people have sought shelter at disused school buildings across the enclave, crowding into classrooms, corridors and playgrounds.</p><p>But school buildings have also been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/world/middleeast/israel-schools-shelters.html" title="">frequent target</a> for airstrikes because Israel argues that many have been used by Hamas to house fighters, store equipment or plan attacks. A vast majority of school buildings, including every university in the Gaza Strip, has been damaged or destroyed during the war.</p><p>The Israeli military said in a statement that before the airstrike on Thursday it had taken “numerous steps” to “mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.”</p><p>“This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law,” the military said.</p><p>Lauren Leatherby<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="8" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjBmNTNlMDQtYzFjYS01ZjFmLWFiMDgtZmRlZTE3MWUxMGNi"><div id="60f53e04-c1ca-5f1f-ab08-fdee171e10cb" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/17/world/israel-lebanon-iran-gaza-news#60f53e04-c1ca-5f1f-ab08-fdee171e10cb"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman"><img alt="Aaron Boxerman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/22/reader-center/author-aaron-boxerman/author-aaron-boxerman-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-17T12:55:54.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 17, 2024, 8:55 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The Israeli authorities just announced that they are examining the possibility that Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, has been killed.

The remains of the body will be compared to DNA collected from Mr. Sinwar during his decades-long incarceration inside Israeli jails, two officials said.</p><p>U.S. officials said that Israel had told the Americans that its soldiers may have killed Mr. Sinwar. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss a sensitive matter. Hamas made no immediate comment.</p><p>The death of Mr. Sinwar, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-war.html" title="">an architect of the Hamas-led attack</a> last October that set off the war in Gaza, would raise hopes of an end to the conflict. Both Mr. Sinwar and the Israeli government had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-oct-7-year-of-war.html" title="">refused to compromise</a> during the monthslong negotiations for a truce. His death could either prompt Hamas to agree to some of Israel’s demands — or provide Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, with a symbolic victory that would give him the political cover he needs to soften his own negotiating stance.</p><p>The military statement on Thursday said that three militants were killed in the exchange and that there were no signs of hostages nearby. It added that soldiers continued to operate in the area.</p><p>Israeli officials said they believed the body may be Mr. Sinwar’s because of the physical similarities, and because intelligence had suggested he was hiding in southern Gaza.</p><p>But they also urged caution because no DNA test had yet been carried out and because they were surprised that such a senior Hamas leader would have been caught in a gunfight above ground. Mr. Sinwar, who is in his early 60s, was thought to have been killed on previous occasions, only for the initial conjecture to be proven wrong.</p><p>Israel and the United States both invested huge resources in the hunt for Mr. Sinwar. American spy agencies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/sinwar-hamas-israel-hezbollah-iran.html" title="">formed a targeting cell</a> after last October’s attacks in Israel to study him and try to intercept his communications.</p><p>In late January, Israeli and American officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html" title="">thought they were on the verge of catching him</a> when Israeli commandos raided an elaborate tunnel complex in southern Gaza where they thought he was hiding, according to American and Israeli officials. But Mr. Sinwar had moved from the bunker beneath the city of Khan Younis just days earlier, leaving behind documents and stacks of Israeli shekels totaling about $1 million, the officials said.</p><p>In August, Israeli troops who discovered the bodies of six hostages in a warren of tunnels beneath Rafah, in southern Gaza, found signs of Mr. Sinwar’s past presence in the area, according to Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister.</p><p>Mr. Sinwar’s decision to attack Israel on Oct. 7 has proved one of the most fateful moves in recent Middle East history. Roughly 1,200 people were killed in Israel some 250 others abducted in the assault, which set off a devastating Israeli counterattack in Gaza in which more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed and much of the blockaded territory left in ruins.</p><p>It also led to a broader war between Israel and Hamas’s regional allies, including Iran, the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, where Israel is currently mounting extensive ground and air attacks.</p><p>Mr. Sinwar has been in hiding throughout the war, eschewing electronic devices and relying on a network of couriers to stay in touch with his organization, according to Israeli and U.S. officials. At times, his communications with Hamas have been intermittent, prompting repeated speculation about his fate.</p><p>But he remained by far Hamas’s most important figure, with the group’s representatives at cease-fire negotiations in Qatar this year telling diplomats that they needed Mr. Sinwar’s input before taking major decisions. In recent months U.S. officials came to believe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/politics/sinwar-hamas-israel-hezbollah-iran.html" title="">Mr. Sinwar did not want to reach a deal</a> and was determined to see Israel enmeshed in a broader regional war.</p><p>Mr. Sinwar emerged from two decades of prison in Israel to rise to the helm of Hamas in Gaza in 2017. In August, he was also named political leader of the entire movement, both inside and outside Gaza, after Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html" title="">assassinated</a> his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh, consolidating Mr. Sinwar’s influence over the organization.</p><p>Julian E.
