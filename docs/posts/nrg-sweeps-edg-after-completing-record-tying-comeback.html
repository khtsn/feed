    <h1>NRG sweeps EDG after completing record-tying comeback</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>The second day of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025/group-stage" target="_blank">Valorant Champions 2025</a> began with a matchup between the dark horse of VCT Americas and the former world champions. NRG swept EDward Gaming <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542207/nrg-vs-edward-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-opening-c/?game=all&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">2-0</a>, getting their first win of Champions 2025 over the former Champions winners.</p>

<p>The series began on Abyss, with both teams running unique compositions. NRG ran a double Controller composition with Harbor, Vyse, and Yoru, while EDG debuted a new variation of their regional double Duelist, this time with <span data-ref-id="0">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/15559/chichoo">

</span> on Sage. <span data-ref-id="1">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> was the star at the start, with a 1v3 classic clutch win on pistol, helping EDG build an early lead on their attack side. Plus, CHICHOO was aware of some sneaky positioning from NRG as EDG converted their bonus. It was hard to start their first series back at Champs any better than EDG did, even as NRG won their first round by stalling the plant on A site. The attack side from EDG looked drilled, with plenty of Sage walls getting value as the team ran ahead to a one-sided 10-2 lead at the half.</p>

<p><em>EDG completes a clean attack on Abyss against NRG.</em></p>

<p>Even with their regional struggles and roster changes, EDG seemed to have secured their victory in the Champions 2024 series hours ago with how they were performing. NRG looked shaky, as they had another advantage on their second pistol only to lose another clutch to Smoggy. NRG needed to string some rounds together, which they did off the backs of <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/11118/skuba">
		skuba	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/5132/mada">
		mada	</a>
</span>. That 11-2 lead disappeared as NRG used their set attack strats to roll over CHICHOO and prevented aggression from ZmjjKK to take the map to overtime. </p>

<p>It seemed like only the attack sides could win, as EDG won their attack side thanks to some clean kills from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span> on Neon, but so did NRG thanks to a standard spam-through-smoke post-plant win on Abyss A site. Jieni7 once again led the way for EDG, but mada lurked to secure another easy A site take for NRG. Then, the first OT defense round win went to NRG thanks to a great bait from mada and skuba, but EDG won their first defense round thanks to CHICHOO and ZmjjKK. </p>

<p>Overtime just kept getting longer, with <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/4164/s0m">

</span> getting four kills to put NRG on top again, but a smart push into EDG&#39;s spawn won the round, secured overtime, and completed the 11-2 comeback to win 17-15 to take the series lead. That comeback tied for the largest comeback in international history, which was a great way for NRG to start their Champs run.</p>

<p><em>NRG pushes aggressively to win overtime and complete the comeback.</em></p>

<p>After starting the map slowly, it was mada that stepped up on the attack side to finish the comeback, ending the map with a 31/24/4 statline, 1.23 map rating, and 191 ADR.</p>

<p>Next up was Corrode, and EDG needed to quickly wipe the memory of their collapse on Abyss to come back in the series. EDG stuck to double Duelist, but no Sentinel this time around, while NRG ran their Waylay composition alongside double Controller. EDG continued their pistol wins with another to start Corrode, thanks to two kills through smokes at the start. If not for skuba tucking into a corner and getting three, EDG nearly converted another bonus round. Instead, NRG got <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/2172/brawk">
		brawk	</a>
</span> the Odin and played smart defense rounds to get an early lead and force a timeout from EDG. Even after that, when EDG got into a 2v1 post-plant position, skuba won it to keep the momentum in NRG&#39;s favor.</p>

<p><em>skuba clutches on Corrode against EDG.</em></p>

<p>EDG got their third round win thanks to some clutch kills from ZmjjKK, and tied the game late into the first half to recover from some disappointing gun rounds. It was 6-6 at the half, with EDG needing to play strong on defense to keep the series going. Smoggy nearly clutched another pistol, but NRG won their first pistol round to retake the lead. They were unable to convert the bonus, and nobody prevented an amazing skuba ace to tie the game at 8-8. The game remained close, but NRG regained and kept a small lead to force EDG into a tough position. NRG reached match point up 12-9 and won the map 13-11, ending the series.</p>

<p>After a record-matching map one, mada spoke on the comeback and the win over EDG.</p>

<p>“I think we just stayed in the game the whole time,” mada said post-match. “Our mental is just too good, as a team. Thankfully, the boys had me on map two.”</p>

<p>While a sweep, this game was very tight, with s0m and Ethan preventing any overtime on Corrode. However, for the player of the series, that was skuba, who played amazingly on both Vyse and Viper. He ended the series with a 1.21 match rating, 47 kills, 79% KAST, and 237 ACS.</p>

<p>With this win, NRG progresses to the winner&#39;s match of Group C, and will face the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542205/team-liquid-vs-drx-valorant-champions-2025-opening-c" target="_blank">Team Liquid versus DRX</a> for a spot in the Champions 2025 playoffs. As for EDG, they go to the elimination game of Group C, and will face the loser of the TL and DRX game to keep their hopes of a back-to-back championship alive.</p>
