Powell, lifted markets on Wednesday, offering some relief from trade war tensions that have gripped investors. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 3 percent in early trading on Wednesday, extending the gain from the day before, when the market jumped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/trump-tariffs-stocks-gold-price.html" title="">2.5 percent</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s statement late Tuesday, along with earlier reports that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that he expected the tariff standoff with China to ease “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/scott-bessent-tax-cuts.html" title="">over the very near future</a>,” combined to send stocks sharply higher.</p><p>The rally came after a steep slide in global markets on Monday, echoing the whiplash earlier this month when Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.html" title="">paused many of his “reciprocal” tariffs</a> hours after they were imposed, turning a steep decline into a forceful gain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We have been seeing deep down days in stocks reversed the next day by big up days, leading to a sideways market,” said Gaurav Mallik, chief investment officer at Pallas Capital Advisors. “Additional progress on trade deals would help to end the sideways market.”</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, the main benchmark for U.S. stocks, sits about 9 percent below its level on Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump took office. The index has fallen about 11 percent from its peak in mid-February, and 4 percent since Mr. Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement.</p><p>Wall Street remains captive to the latest statements from the White House. “The erratic threaten-retreat-threaten-retreat cycle has economic consequences,” Paul Donovan, the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note. “The uncertainty this causes may impact consumer and business decision-making.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the markets:</p><ul><li><p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose almost 4 percent. Amazon’s stock jumped more than 7 percent and Meta gained 6 percent, moves worth hundreds of billions of dollars in market value, given the size of the tech giants.</p></li><li><p>Shares of Tesla rose about 4 percent, even though the automaker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html#:~:text=He%20spoke%20less%20than%20two,way%20cryptocurrency%20assets%20are%20valued." title="">reported a steep drop in profit</a> the day before. Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, said he would spend less time in Washington; his involvement in the Trump administration, competition from Chinese carmakers and a lack of new models has contributed to a slump in sales.</p></li><li><p>Markets gained across much Asia and Europe. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.9 percent; Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 2.5 percent; and in Germany, the DAX jumped 2.8 percent.</p></li><li><p>The dollar regained some of its recent losses. An index of the dollar against a basket of major currencies rose 0.5 percent.</p></li><li><p>The price of 10-year Treasury bonds rose strongly, a sign that investors were more willing to buy U.S. debt. The yield, which moves inversely to price, dropped to 4.3 percent.</p></li><li><p>Gold, which hit a record $3,500 an ounce on Tuesday, eased back. It fell to around $3,300 on Wednesday, down more than 3 percent for the day.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
