He had planned to run as an independent.</p><p>“I am advising you that I wish to have my name withdrawn from the ballot,” Mr. Menendez wrote in a one-sentence email to the New Jersey Division of Elections.</p><p>Mr. Menendez, 70, was found guilty of taking bribes and acting as an agent of Egypt after a two-month trial in Manhattan, and he had virtually no chance of winning re-election.</p></div></div><div><div><p>He had not mounted a campaign and is reliant on his shrinking election war chest to pay lawyers as he prepares to appeal his conviction on 16 criminal counts. He has also dipped into his campaign funds to pay lawyers representing his wife, Nadine Menendez, who is awaiting trial on charges that she traded her husband’s political influence for cash, gold and a Mercedes-Benz convertible.</p><p>But until Friday it was unclear whether voters might get one more chance to cast a vote for Mr. Menendez, who has lost only one campaign in his storied political career — his first race for mayor of Union City, N.J., in 1982.</p><p>Mr. Menendez did not compete in the Democratic primary in June, but he did file three times the requisite number of signatures needed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/nyregion/senator-robert-menendez-independent-campaign.html" title="">lock in a spot on the ballot</a> in November. He had until the end of Friday to pull his name off the ballot.</p><p>Had he opted against bowing out, he would have faced off against Curtis Bashaw, a Republican hotel developer, and Representative Andy Kim, a third-term congressman who won the Democratic primary with 75 percent of the vote and is heavily favored to win in November. Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by nearly <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2024/2024-08-voter-registration-by-congressional-district.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one million registered voters</a>, and it has been more than 50 years since the state elected a Republican senator.</p><p>Mr. Menendez can continue to use his remaining <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00264564/1800936/#SUMMARY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$3.3 million in campaign funds</a> to pay legal fees even though he is no longer running for office. But he is now precluded from accepting additional campaign contributions.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The campaign contribution spigot had tapered off drastically after he was indicted in September. He took in just $731.50 from mid-May through the end of June, according to his most recent <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00264564/1800936/#SUMMARY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Election Commission filing</a>.</p><p>There was more activity in a defense fund he had established to help pay his legal fees. Twenty-one donors contributed a total of <a href="https://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/basicSearch/downloadFile?formId=149333&amp;formType=e8872" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$127,500</a> between April and July, federal records show. He can legally continue to accept donations to the defense fund, regardless of his status as a candidate.</p><p>Mr. Menendez’s legal woes have proved to be a source of significant embarrassment for Democrats struggling to hold on to the White House and retain their narrow margin in the Senate.</p><p>Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, refrained from calling for Mr. Menendez’s resignation until after his conviction. </p><p>Ms. Menendez’s trial has been delayed while she is being treated for breast cancer.</p><p>Friday, however, was also the deadline for Ms. Menendez, 57, to provide Judge Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court with medical records documenting that she remains too sick to participate in her own defense.</p></div></div><div><p>Mr. Menendez, his two co-defendants and a disgraced insurance broker who pleaded guilty and testified against the senator during the trial are all scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 29. Each faces decades in prison.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tracey Tully is a reporter for The Times who covers New Jersey, where she has lived for more than 20 years.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully">More about Tracey Tully</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
