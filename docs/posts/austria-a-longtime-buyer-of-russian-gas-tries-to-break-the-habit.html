deep underground. The water’s heat will be used initially to warm 20,000 households in the Austrian capital. It will then be pumped back below the surface.</p><p>This geothermal energy will reduce the city’s consumption of natural gas — an important consideration in Europe, and not just because it will cut carbon dioxide emissions. OMV, the Vienna-based company supervising the project, is trying to break a longstanding dependency on Russia for gas by pushing to secure new energy sources.</p><p>“For us it’s a new chapter,” said OMV’s chief executive, Alfred Stern.

During the talks, Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, said Russia was seeking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-putin-trump.html" title="">rebuild business ties</a> with Western companies, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html" title="">oil producers</a>.</p><p>Austria was among the first European countries to begin importing Russian gas in 1968. Extensive business and personal ties have grown between Russia and Austria in the years since. Generations of European and Russian executives “told themselves the story about how reliable and good this all is and how mutually beneficial,” said Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based research institution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Until recently, OMV, whose predecessor was managed by the Soviets after World War II, argued that it had no choice but to honor a large gas import contract that it made in 2006 with Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An OMV natural gas storage station.

The pipeline that fed Austria through Ukraine and Slovakia stopped flowing at the beginning of this year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>OMV says it has prepared for this moment for more than two years. It is helped by being a sizable company with 24,000 employees and a large gas sales and trading business that accounts for about a third of the Austrian commercial market. For 2024, OMV reported adjusted earnings of €5.1 million (about $5.3 million) on €34 billion (roughly $36 billion) in sales.</p><p>While war raged in Ukraine, OMV’s gas managers have been shifting supply lines, mainly through Germany. Mr. Stern said OMV was now bringing gas piped from Norway, where OMV has production facilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A short drive from Vienna, pump jacks nod like mechanical farm animals in the fields.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Payr for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The company also has secured capacity for liquefied natural gas shipments at a large natural gas terminal in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, called the Gate, and it has signed multiyear contracts with BP and Cheniere Energy, a large American provider.</p><p>Lining up these alternatives to Russian gas has been costly, OMV says, even though the Austrian government, which owns 31 percent of OMV, contributed a portion of the expense. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company also owns 25 percent of OMV.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The changed energy picture in Europe has made the petroleum production skills embedded in a company like OMV more valuable.

Henrik Mosser, OMV’s general manager for Austria exploration and production, said the discovery could increase OMV’s modest gas production in Austria about 50 percent — or more if nearby exploration panned out.</p><p>OMV experts are also taking their understanding of geology to the geothermal experiment near Vienna, where the rig is boring a hole nearly two miles deep into porous rock, steeped in hot water that piled up in an ancient riverbed 16 million years ago, said Niki Knezevic, a geologist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Although the project pumps hot water for heating operations run by the utility Wien Energie, the required expertise is similar to what is needed for extracting petroleum.</p><p>“Drilling is drilling,” said Bernhard Novotny, the project director.</p><p>The largest payoff may come in Romania, where OMV Petrom, a subsidiary, is preparing to develop a major gas discovery in the Black Sea called Neptun Deep. If <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/business/romania-energy-nuclear-power-natural-gas.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">successful, it should cement Romania’s position</a> as the largest gas producer in the European Union and enable exports to Europe’s “gas hungry” industrial heartland, including Austria, said Ross McGavin, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Niki Knezevic, a geologist, at the drilling site in Vienna.

OMV maintains a large portion of these reserves — about a quarter of Austria’s annual consumption — pumped underground into porous rocks. Overall, Austria can store more than a year’s worth of gas.</p><p>In an interview in the control center of one of these facilities near Schönkirchen, Werner Schildknecht, a department manager for OMV, said that on cold days its compressors gear up to “provide gas to Vienna in the mornings.” On warm days, the flows reverse, adding to stocks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>This winter has been colder than the previous two, jacking up pressure on the gas markets. Like much of Europe, Austria has responded by burning up stored gas. In January, storage was Austria’s main source of gas, said Natasha Fielding, head of European gas pricing at Argus Media, a research firm.</p><p>Europe and Austria are paying a stiff price for the curtailment of Russian gas. Although European prices may not have reached the astronomical levels of 2022, they recently hit two-year highs. Austria pays even more, reflecting the cost of bringing gas across borders, mainly through Germany.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-23"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Innovation and Technology Center has displays demonstrating oil industry technology.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Payr for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The control room at an OMV gas storage station.
