    <h1>Chuck Todd Is Leaving NBC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chuck Todd, the former “Meet the Press” moderator and a longtime fixture of NBC’s political coverage, told colleagues on Friday that he was leaving the network.</p><p>A nearly two-decade veteran of NBC, Mr. Todd said that Friday would be his last day at NBC.</p><p>“There’s never a perfect time to leave a place that’s been a professional home for so long, but I’m pretty excited about a few new projects that are on the cusp of going from ‘pie in the sky’ to ‘near reality,’” he wrote to colleagues. “So I’m grateful for the chance to get a jump start on my next chapter during this important moment.”</p><p>Mr. Todd, 52, is the latest TV news star to step aside at a moment when salaries are being scrutinized — and slashed — by major media companies. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/business/media/hoda-kotb-today-nbc.html" title="">Hoda Kotb exited</a> NBC’s “Today” show this month, and Neil Cavuto of Fox News and CNN’s Chris Wallace departed their cable news homes late last year.</p><p>Mr. Todd joined NBC in 2007 and became a major presence of NBC and MSNBC’s political coverage during the 2008 presidential campaign. From there, Mr. Todd’s profile grew considerably. He was named the “Meet the Press” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/business/media/nbc-chooses-chuck-todd-to-replace-david-gregory-on-meet-the-press.html" title="">moderator in 2014</a>, and he also hosted a daily talk show on MSNBC, “Meet the Press Daily.”</p></div></div>
