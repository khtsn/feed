From there, Mr. Todd’s profile grew considerably. He was named the “Meet the Press” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/business/media/nbc-chooses-chuck-todd-to-replace-david-gregory-on-meet-the-press.html" title="">moderator in 2014</a>, and he also hosted a daily talk show on MSNBC, “Meet the Press Daily.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But over the past few years, Mr. Todd has been less omnipresent on NBC’s airwaves. The MSNBC show was moved to a digital channel in 2022, and Mr. Todd <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/business/media/chuck-todd-meet-the-press.html" title="">stepped down</a> from “Meet the Press” in 2023, handing over the reins to Kristen Welker.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Todd helped unleash a rare on-air rebellion after the network hired Ronna McDaniel, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, as a political analyst. His comments about the hiring during an episode of “Meet the Press” opened the floodgates at the company, with MSNBC stars like Rachel Maddow, Joe Scarborough and Nicolle Wallace also criticizing the hiring on the air, before Ms. McDaniel was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/business/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-msnbc.html" title="">abruptly let go</a>.</p><p>In a statement, NBC News said on Friday: “We’re grateful for Chuck’s many contributions to our political coverage during his nearly two-decade career at NBC News and for his deep commitment to ‘Meet the Press’ and its enduring legacy. We wish him all the best in his next endeavors.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
