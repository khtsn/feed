The two countries agreed that “a third party” may not co-opt Nauru’s critical infrastructure for security purposes.</p><p>In exchange, Australia will provide the country with 140 million Australian dollars (about $90 million) over the five years in budget support and security assistance, a substantial sum for Nauru, a tiny island of 13,000 people and a <a href="https://datacatalogfiles.worldbank.org/ddh-published/0038130/DR0046441/GDP.pdf?versionId=2024-07-01T12:42:23.8710032Z" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$150 million economy</a>.</p><p>“It is about containing Chinese influence,” said Meg Keen, a senior fellow in the Pacific Islands Program at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute. “This deal effectively can lock out China from engagement in the security sector, in particular policing and military.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Australian and American officials were caught off guard in 2022 when China announced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/world/asia/china-solomon-islands-security-pact.html" title="">sweeping security pact</a> with the Solomon Islands that opened the door to a Chinese military presence on the archipelago. The Solomon Islands lie about 1,200 miles to Australia’s northeast, halfway to Nauru.</p><p>That agreement put the United States and the region on edge amid signs in recent years that China was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/world/asia/china-pacific-island-countries.html" title="">seeking to expand its reach</a> in the Pacific, offering policing and security assistance and developmental aid.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nauru abruptly announced it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/world/asia/taiwan-nauru-china-election.html" title="">cutting diplomatic ties</a> with Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. Shortly thereafter, President David Adeang made a state visit to China — the first for a Nauruan leader — and also met with officials from the Bank of China, which was considering providing financial services in Nauru.</p><p>Now, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia will provide banking services in Nauru, following <a href="https://www.bendigobank.com.au/media-centre/joint-statement-from-bendigo-bank-and-the-government-of-nauru/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the pullout next year</a> of another Australian bank, Bendigo. That provision was part of the deal by Mr. Adeang and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, in Canberra on Monday.</p><p>“This treaty strengthens our own economy, enhances our mutual security, and addresses critical challenges like de-banking, ensuring inclusive growth and resilience for our people,” Mr. Adeang said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/republicofnauru/posts/pfbid02vjnRPRwNL3fbZJCuNH2DuJPjbZp2J6UhV8fTTTdXhPzZM4Jd9sqWdUKUVJdZtxhtl?rdid=NtczOCt53dzJ0tVp#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a>, calling Australia “family, bound by shared history and values.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Last year, Australia reached <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/australia/tuvalu-climate.html" title="">an agreement</a> with another Pacific nation, Tuvalu, offering climate refugee status to its citizens and assistance with disaster relief. In return, Tuvalu pledged not to enter into security or defense arrangements with other nations without Australia’s assent, wording echoed in this week’s agreement with Nauru.</p><p>In the treaty with Nauru, which is more substantial than any previous agreement between the two countries, Australia was most likely signaling to other Pacific island nations that it was a solid partner that would help meet the smaller countries’ specific needs.</p><p>The Nauru deal does not preclude China from making inroads by providing other types of aid in education, and the island nations will continue exploring their options, Ms. Keen said.</p><p>“They are looking for the best development deals on offer, given that they face significant climate challenges, development challenges and security challenges,” she said. </p><p>A former Australian colony, Nauru was once one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/world/a-pacific-island-nation-is-stripped-of-everything.html" title="">world’s richest countries</a>, per capita. But it has long since stripped the phosphates that made it wealthy and squandered the riches the minerals brought.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Victoria Kim is a reporter based in Seoul and focuses on breaking news coverage across the world.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">More about Victoria Kim</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
