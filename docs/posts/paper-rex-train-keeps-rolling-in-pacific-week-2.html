		<p>Following a gauntlet week, which saw all 12 of the region&#39;s teams play two matches in a six-day span, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">Pacific Stage 2</a> continued.</p>

<p>Group Alpha, after ending with all six teams holding a 1-1 record, was divided into two parts after the second week, with three winning teams advancing to 2-1 and the three losing teams falling to 1-2. In Group Omega, trends from the opening week of the stage continued into the second week, with a pair of struggling teams falling to 0-3 and a familiar face cementing itself at the top with a 3-0 record. In the race to secure qualification to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions 2025</a> and extend their stays in VCT, both Ascension teams sit outside of their respective group&#39;s playoff spots, which could be cause for concern.</p>

<p>The week&#39;s results are as follows:</p>



<p>The week started with a matchup that pitted familiar faces against each other. Recent Global Esports signing <span data-ref-id="12">

</span> went up against his former Gen.G teammates, while <span data-ref-id="13">

</span> took on former T1 teammate <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/2489/munchkin">
		Munchkin	</a>
</span>. At this point in the season, a strong understanding of what they are good at helped both teams to win their map picks swiftly in 13-3 fashion. Gen.G protected their Lotus, while GE stood tall on Icebox. On Corrode, Gen.G&#39;s double Controller comp of Viper and Omen gave them domination over mid, pulling them over the finish line to a 13-7 victory. Gen.G Duelist <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9196/t3xture">
		t3xture	</a>
</span> scored an ace, breaking the curse to help his team to its first victory in a match that he aces.</p>


<p><em>t3xture&#39;s monumental ace.</em></p>

<p>The second match of the day saw DetonatioN FocusMe pull an upset over TALON, who had just broken a curse of a back-and-forth win-loss pattern. After stealing each other&#39;s map picks 13-9, DFM Duelist <span data-ref-id="16">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/6672/meiy">
		Meiy	</a>
</span> landed on Icebox, which has been arguably his best map this stage. Just over a week after dropping 39 kills against ZETA, Meiy led DFM to a 13-8 win, dropping a team-leading 19 kills in the process. He dropped a server-high 66 kills in the series, marking the second time this season that he has eclipsed the 60-kill mark this year.</p>

<p>T1 hosted ZETA Division in a historic event, which was the first-ever roadshow event in VCT history. The match, which saw brothers <span data-ref-id="17">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13039/meteor">
		Meteor	</a>
</span> and <span data-ref-id="18">

</span> clash for the first time in their professional careers, was not quite close. On ZETA&#39;s pick of Corrode, T1 fielded a double Controller comp of Omen and Astra, with Meteor on the latter. Recent <span data-ref-id="19">

</span> no longer showed any signs of rookie jitters, having the highest rating on the team with a 1.34. His efforts helped the hosts to a 13-8 win on the map. T1 opted for a double Duelist comp on its pick of Sunset, which ended 13-6 thanks to a dominant 9-3 defense half from T1.</p>

<p>In their fight to continue fighting for Champions qualification, Nongshim RedForce came up short against Rex Regum Qeon. The match saw NS barely claim a 13-11 win on their map pick of Corrode, followed by RRQ defending their Haven 13-8. While a well-rounded performance from NS willed the Ascension squad through two maps, starpower helped RRQ through the whole series. <span data-ref-id="21">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/24895/jemkin">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="22">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/8497/monyet">

</span>, who fill the team&#39;s Duelist roles, did most of the heavy lifting for the squad by way of kills, ending with over 60 each. On the decider map of Icebox, the duo combined for 41 kills to help RRQ blow out NS 13-3 and put their playoff hopes in jeopardy.</p>

<p>In the quickest series of the week, DRX pushed aside Team Secret, winning 2-0. Both maps were won 13-4. The series started with DRX&#39;s Icebox, where the Korean squad dismantled their opponents. After losing both pistol rounds, they won both of the following eco rounds, destroying Team Secret&#39;s economy. A 10-2 start on Team Secret&#39;s Corrode all but guaranteed the beginning of the end. With <span data-ref-id="23">

</span> now taking on the IGL duties for DRX, <span data-ref-id="24">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4462/mako">

</span> appears to be playing more freely, leading to DRX recapturing their form from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2277/vct-2025-pacific-kickoff" target="_blank">Pacific Kickoff</a> to start the year.</p>


<p><em>A nice triple kill from <span data-ref-id="25">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/1916/free1ng">
		free1ng	</a>
</span> was not enough to grab this round on Icebox.</em></p>

<p>Since dominating the group stage of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1" target="_blank">Stage 1</a>, BOOM Esports has lost five straight matches in Pacific, winning no maps in that span. That run of poor form continued against Paper Rex, kickstarted by a 13-8 loss on their map pick of Bind. Riding a 9-3 halftime lead, the Paper Rex train never lost steam, fueled by a double Duelist comp featuring <span data-ref-id="26">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/17086/something">
		something	</a>
</span>&#39;s Yoru and <span data-ref-id="27">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7378/jinggg">
		Jinggg	</a>
</span>&#39;s Raze. On PRX&#39;s Lotus, a similar comp was fielded, with Omen entering for Brimstone and Vyse swapping in for Viper. While the map was a closer affair, PRX closed out a 13-10 win to move to 3-0.</p>


<p><em>something said no ace for Jinggg.</em></p>
