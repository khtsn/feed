Both have called for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza in statements that the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, has previously condemned as “monstrous.”</p><p>“Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights,” Mr. Lammy and the foreign ministers of the four other countries said in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-partners-unite-to-sanction-ministers-inciting-west-bank-violence?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=4875927c-c1df-43e1-bc19-1373b950b1e5&amp;utm_content=immediately" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a joint statement</a> on Tuesday. “That is why we have taken action now — to hold those responsible to account.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While the measures are in response to violence in the West Bank, British officials said they were also calculated to ratchet up the pressure on Mr. Netanyahu’s government to negotiate a cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza, at a time when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/middleeast/gaza-children-hunger.html" title="">the humanitarian situation in the enclave</a> had become increasingly dire.</p><p>The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, reacted defiantly, describing the move as “unacceptable,” and saying the government would meet next week to discuss a response.</p><p>“It is outrageous that elected representatives and members of the government are subjected to these kind of measures,” Mr. Saar said.</p><p>The move to blacklist Mr. Ben-Gvir and Mr. Smotrich had been weeks in the making and came after Britain, Canada and France issued <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2025/05/19/joint-statement-leaders-canada-united-kingdom-and-france-situation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a stark statement</a> last month about the treatment of civilians in Gaza.</p><p>But France did not join in imposing sanctions on Mr. Smotrich and Mr. Ben-Gvir, illustrating some differences in how allies are approaching Israel. British officials said they had sounded out officials in the Trump administration about the planned move in recent weeks and had not encountered strong resistance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In their joint statement, the five countries said, “We will strive to achieve an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the immediate release of the remaining hostages by Hamas, which can have no future role in the governance of Gaza, a surge in aid, and a path to a two-state solution.”</p><p>Speaking in Parliament in late May, Mr. Lammy denounced Israel’s conduct of the war. He said that Britain would suspend talks on a trade agreement and blasted <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/smotrich-says-gaza-to-be-totally-destroyed-population-concentrated-in-small-area/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comments by Mr. Smotrich</a> about “cleansing” Gaza and moving its two million people to other countries.</p><p>“We must call this what it is,” Mr. Lammy said. “It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Matina Stevis-Gridneff is the Canada bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the country.</p></div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
