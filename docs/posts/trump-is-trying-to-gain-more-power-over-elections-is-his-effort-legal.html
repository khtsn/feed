Instead, it <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gives states the power</a> to set the “times, places and manner” of elections, leaving them to decide the rules, oversee voting and try to prevent fraud. Congress can also pass election laws or override state legislation, as it did with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p><p>Yet Mr. Trump’s order, which follows a yearslong Republican push to tighten voting laws out of a false belief that the 2020 election was rigged, bypasses both the states and Congress. Republican lawmakers in Washington are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5301676/save-act-explainer-voter-registration" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trying to pass</a> many of the same voting restrictions, but they are unlikely to make it through the Senate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here’s what to know about an order that provides the latest example of how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/trump-power-courts-crisis.html" title="">Mr. Trump is trying to expand his presidential power</a>.</p><h2 id="link-c325189">What does the order include?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Election workers counting absentee ballots in Milwaukee on election night in November.

And it instructs the U.S. attorney general to hunt for and prosecute election crimes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-63b8a838">Is this legal?</h2><p>Probably not all of it, legal experts say — and voting rights groups and state attorneys general are already signaling that they will file challenges.</p><p>Several experts predicted that provisions of the order might well be found unlawful, though they said that others, like directions to Mr. Trump’s attorney general and other cabinet members, fell within legal bounds.</p><p>“It’s an attempt at a power grab,” said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The president has been seen in the past as having no role to play when it comes to the conduct of federal elections, and this attempt to assert authority over the conduct of federal elections would take power away from both an independent federal agency and from the states.”</p><h2 id="link-42321b8a">What parts might be challenged?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voters dropping off mail ballots in Las Vegas in November. Seventeen states have laws that allow for mail ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive soon afterward. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Gale for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>A central question surrounds Mr. Trump’s attempt to use the Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that Congress created in 2002 to help election officials with their work, to enforce the proof-of-citizenship requirement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Currently, Americans may register to vote in federal elections either through their state or by using a federal form created by the E.A.C. The form includes a box that registrants check to attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens, but it does not require documentation as proof.</p><p>The executive order would force the E.A.C. to change that process to require a passport, state identification that includes citizenship information or military identification.</p><p>Legal experts dispute that Mr. Trump has the authority to force the agency, which Congress designated as “independent” and which includes two commissioners from each party, to take any action.</p><p>“He can ask nicely,” said Justin Levitt, a professor of constitutional law at Loyola Marymount University who served in the Biden administration. “But he thinks he’s got a power that, at least so far, he does not have. It would take a change in the law and the Supreme Court affirmatively approving a radical expansion of power of the executive.”</p><p>Legal experts say the provision requiring all ballots to arrive by Election Day also probably exceeds the president’s legal authority, particularly the threat to withhold federal funding from those states that do not comply. (Seventeen states currently allow mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive soon afterward.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“If the president is basically usurping the power of the purse by imposing limits on these grants that Congress itself did not impose, that could be the basis for constitutionally challenging these conditions,” said Laurence H. Tribe, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s attempt to force states to turn over voter data to Mr. Musk’s team and federal agencies recalls a similar program from the first Trump administration, a commission on “election integrity” led by Kris Kobach, who is now the Kansas attorney general.</p><p>The commission sought data from all 50 states, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/03/politics/kris-kobach-letter-voter-fraud-commission-information/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">44 of them refused to comply</a>. The Republican secretary of state in Mississippi told the commission to “go jump in the Gulf of Mexico.”</p><h2 id="link-59049e1b">What is the potential impact on voters and elections?</h2><p>If the full order were to stand, it could potentially disenfranchise millions of Americans and cost state and local governments millions of dollars.</p><p>About 21.3 million people do not have proof of citizenship readily available, according to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/millions-americans-dont-have-documents-proving-their-citizenship-readily" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2023 study by the Brennan Center for Justice</a>, a voting rights and democracy group. Nearly four million people do not have the documents at all because they were lost, destroyed or stolen. The executive order does not directly mention birth certificates to prove citizenship.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>It is also unclear whether women who have changed their surname after marriage will face new hurdles in proving their citizenship.</p><p>The order could also lead election officials to throw out sizable numbers of ballots that arrive after Election Day. For example, in Nevada’s two largest counties in the 2022 general election, about 45,000 ballots arrived after Election Day and were counted, according to state data. In Washington State, Kim Wyman, a Republican former secretary of state, estimated that “about a third of the ballots in any given election” arrived on the Wednesday or Thursday after Election Day.</p><p>The order could put states in deep budget holes, as well. Many states, including the battlegrounds of Georgia and Pennsylvania, use voting machines with bar codes or QR codes. Replacing them would cost millions of dollars that the order does not provide.</p><h2 id="link-5790df55">Republicans won in 2024.

He also railed against mail voting, even as Republican groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/politics/trump-2024-election-mail-votes.html" title="">successfully pushed more of the party’s voters</a> to cast ballots that way.</p><p>Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, a conservative advocacy group tied to the activist Leonard Leo, said the executive order was simply enforcing laws already passed by Congress. He referred to a ruling from a federal appeals court that found that Congress’s selection of a federal Election Day meant all voting must be completed by that day, with no late-arriving ballots permitted.</p><p>“The executive order is acting well within the four corners of those existing laws, so we’re not breaking new ground in terms of legal authority,” Mr. Snead said. “We’re not breaking new ground in terms of the relationship between the federal government and the states.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nick Corasaniti is a Times reporter covering national politics, with a focus on voting and elections.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nick-corasaniti">More about Nick Corasaniti</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/republican-party">Republican Party</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Signal Leak:</strong> After a day of Trump administration officials saying no classified information was contained in the Signal app chat that the journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was added to by the national security adviser, The Atlantic has released the full set of messages.
