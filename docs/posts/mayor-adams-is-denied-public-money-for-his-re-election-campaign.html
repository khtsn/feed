Schaffer, the board’s chair.</p><p>Mr. Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges in September and is expected to go on trial in April; his top adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, resigned on Sunday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/nyregion/ingrid-lewis-martin-resigns-eric-adams.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" title="">amid a grand jury investigation</a> by prosecutors in Manhattan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The mayor, who has seen his approval rating fall to a record low, is facing a difficult path to re-election next year, and the denial of matching funds places him at a significant disadvantage. He will have less money to spend on television advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in a competitive race, and could be forced to devote more time to fund-raising.</p><p>The board’s denial of matching funds is not unprecedented. John Liu, a top mayoral candidate in 2013, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/nyregion/campaign-finance-board-denies-liu-public-funds.html" title="">denied $3.5 million in public matching funds</a> after two campaign workers were convicted in a straw-donor scandal. The decision exacerbated his political problems, and he finished the Democratic primary race in fourth place.</p><p>The federal indictment against Mr. Adams accused him of soliciting and accepting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/04/nyregion/eric-adams-straw-donor-scheme.html" title="">straw donations</a> for both his 2021 campaign and his 2025 re-election campaign. Prosecutors said that he conspired with foreign nationals to illegally funnel money into his campaign coffers and his team encouraged businessmen to have employees make donations and reimburse them.</p><p>Some <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/opinion/2024/12/opinion-cfb-should-not-give-another-dime-adams-campaign/401412/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elected officials</a> and good government groups had called on the Campaign Finance Board to deny Mr. Adams public matching funds. Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, <a href="http://readme.readmedia.com/Common-Cause-NY-Urges-Campaign-Finance-Board-to-Reject-Matching-Funds-for-Mayor-Adams/20448207" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a letter to the board</a> this month arguing that the Adams campaign had shown a “persistent and pervasive disregard&#34; for the law.</p><p>“It is incumbent on the board to exercise its discretion to address the myriad failings of Eric Adams to comply with the law by finding that he is ineligible for matching funds,” she wrote, “and so demonstrate to New Yorkers that no person is above the law.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Bianca Pallaro is a Times reporter who combines traditional reporting with data analysis skills to investigate wrongdoing and explain complex issues by turning numbers into insightful information.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/bianca-pallaro">More about Bianca Pallaro</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Adams Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Meeting With ‘Border Czar’</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>As New York City braces for an immigration crackdown, Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/nyregion/adams-homan-meeting-migrants.html">met with Thomas Homan</a>, President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming “border czar.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Stance on Migrants</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Adams has become more outspoken about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/adams-migrants-sanctuary-nyc.html">his desire to detain “dangerous” immigrants</a>, a view more closely aligned with Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Solitary Confinement Ban</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The New York City Council <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/solitary-confinement-nyc-adams.html">filed a lawsuit</a> seeking to force Adams to carry out a law banning solitary confinement in city jails, arguing that blocking the law went beyond the mayor’s legal authority.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan for New Homes</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The City Council <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/nyc-housing-city-of-yes.html">approved an ambitious plan</a> that could make way for 80,000 new homes over the next 15 years, the most significant effort to address the city’s housing crisis in decades.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tax Cut Proposal</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Amid voter concerns over the cost of rent, food and child care, Adams announced a plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/nyregion/adams-income-tax-cut-nyc.html">eliminate income taxes</a> for more than 400,000 of the city’s lowest wage earners.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
