In 1973, he shared a <a href="https://www.grammy.com/awards/16th-annual-grammy-awards" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grammy Award</a> for his illustration work on the London Philharmonic Orchestra’s rendition of “Tommy.”</p><p>For his poster for the Rolling Stones’ 1969 U.S. tour, which culminated in the violence-marred Altamont festival in Northern California, Mr. Byrd paid no mind to the band’s increasingly sinister image. Instead, he opted for an illustration of <a href="https://www.bahrgallery.com/band-items/rolling-stones-tour-blank-1969" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an elegant female nude</a> twirling billowing fabric, drawing for inspiration on the late-19th-century motion photographs by Eadweard Muybridge.</p><p>Mr. Byrd’s theater work included a surreal poster for “Follies,” the bittersweet 1971 Broadway evocation of the Ziegfeld Follies era with music and lyrics by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/theater/stephen-sondheim-dead.html" title="">Stephen Sondheim</a>.

Mr. Byrd took it in stride.</p><p>“I didn’t think of it as any kind of ‘branding’ for the event,” he said of his poster. “I thought of it as a souvenir of the event.”</p><p>Mr. Byrd was impressed by — and to a degree, aligned with — the work of the so-called Big Five psychedelic poster artists of San Francisco: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/arts/design/04kelley.html" title="">Alton Kelley</a>, <a href="https://www.rickgriffindesigns.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rick Griffin</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/arts/design/victor-moscoso-psychedelic-drawings-1967-1982.html" title="">Victor Moscoso</a>, <a href="https://mousestudios.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqrG9BhAVEiwAaPu5zjmO50_2_i1bnhFUM-c-XgRTLQag6A39gcnH3UJXONcsfiwaC7GHZxoC4EIQAvD_BwE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stanley Mouse</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/arts/design/wes-wilson-dead.html" title="">Wes Wilson</a>, who were known for using kaleidoscopic patterns, explosions of color and fonts that seemed to bend and ooze like Salvador Dalí clocks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But, based 3,000 miles from the Haight-Ashbury scene, Mr. Byrd was also influenced by Broadway and advertising, employing standard typefaces and drawing on the Art Nouveau movement of 1890s Europe. His work is “kind of like Art Nouveau on acid,” said <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/people/thomas-la-padula/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thomas La Padula,</a> an adjunct professor of illustration at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where Mr. Byrd taught in the 1970s.</p></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-12"><div><figcaption><span>Mr. Byrd’s work, which included renderings of some of the biggest names in rock, was, a colleague said, “kind of like Art Nouveau on acid.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Images via the estate of David Edward Byrd</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Throughout, however, Mr. Byrd could enjoy the unfettered freedom afforded by the music world in those days. “With rock, there was no basic subject matter,” he wrote in “Poster Child.” “It was just whatever you wanted to do that was eye-catching.”</p><p>David Edward Byrd was born on April 4, 1941, in Cleveland, Tenn., the only child of Willis Byrd, a traveling salesman, and Veda (Mount) Byrd, a part-time model. His parents divorced when he was young, and he spent most of his youth in Miami Beach with his mother and his wealthy stepfather, Al Miller, an executive with the Howard Johnson’s restaurant chain.</p><p>After receiving a bachelor’s degree in fine art and a master’s in stone lithography from Andy Warhol’s alma mater, the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh (now Carnegie Mellon University), he settled in an upstate New York commune, where he was painting in the vein of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/29/arts/francis-bacon-82-artist-of-the-macabre-dies.html" title="">Francis Bacon</a>, the Irish-born artist and master of the macabre, when college friends, including <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/200467" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joshua White</a>, who designed the dazzling light shows for the Fillmore East, hooked him up with Mr. Graham.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Byrd in his studio in New York City in the 1970s.

For a Grateful Dead concert at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island in 1973, he came up with an impish illustration of two clean-cut 1950s teenagers boogieing under the self-consciously corny tagline “A Swell Dance Concert.”</p><p>Mr. Byrd also produced a retro-inflected album cover for Lou Reed’s 1974 album, “Sally Can’t Dance,” as well as posters for the band Kiss. He made a foray into Hollywood with his poster for the 1975 film adaptation of “The Day of the Locust,” Nathanael West’s dystopian Hollywood novel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Byrd’s sketch for the retro-inflected cover of Lou Reed’s 1974 album “Sally Can’t Dance.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Byrd&#39;s design sketch from &#34;Poster Child: The Psychedelic Art &amp; Technicolor Life of David Edward Byrd” by David Edward Byrd &amp; Robert von Goeben</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The finished product.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">RCA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Byrd moved to Los Angeles in 1981 and worked there as the art director for Van Halen’s “Fair Warning” tour.
