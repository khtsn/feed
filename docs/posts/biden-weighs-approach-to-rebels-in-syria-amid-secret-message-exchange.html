In fact, just today, U.S. forces conducted a dozen of precision strikes, airstrikes, within Syria, targeting ISIS camps and ISIS operatives. We will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition away from the Assad regime, toward independent sovereign, an independent, independent, I want to say it again, sovereign Syria, with a new Constitution, a new government that serves all Syrians.

And should it?</p><p>The main rebel faction that toppled President Bashar al-Assad is a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was once an affiliate of Al Qaeda and, even though it broke with the older organization years ago, remains designated a terrorist group itself by the U.S. government.</p><p>The United States has been passing messages through the Turkish government in recent days to the rebel groups involved in the lightning blitz that suddenly took down Mr. al-Assad, mainly warning them against teaming up with militants from the Islamic State. The groups responded through the Turks with assurances that they had no intention of allowing the Islamic State to be part of their movement, according to U.S. and Turkish officials briefed on the messages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But now Mr. Biden and his top advisers are debating the extent to which they should engage directly with the rebel groups going forward, according to the officials, who described internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity. U.S. intelligence analysts and administration policymakers were trying to determine whether the groups had substantially changed, or were prepared to change, their ways to address the concerns of the United States and its allies in the region about terrorist affiliations.</p><p>In a televised statement from the White House hailing the fall of the Assad family’s half century of repressive rule in Syria, Mr. Biden gave voice to the mix of cautious optimism and wary uncertainty about the new forces taking power in Syria.</p><p>“Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses,” he said on Sunday. “We’ve taken note of statements by the leaders of these rebel groups in recent days and they’re saying the right things now. But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words but their actions.”</p><p>The Islamic State, or ISIS, remains a key concern for U.S. leaders. After destroying the so-called caliphate that the group carved out of Syria and Iraq for itself, the United States does not want to give it any opportunity to reassert itself in the chaos that may follow the fall of the government in Damascus.</p><p>“We’re cleareyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capability, to create a safe haven,” Mr. Biden said. “We will not let that happen.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>To that end, Mr. Biden authorized U.S. airstrikes on Sunday against Islamic State camps and operatives inside Syria. A swarm of B-52, F-15 and A-10 warplanes hit more than 75 targets in central Syria with about 140 munitions, according to U.S. officials.</p><p>“There should be no doubt — we will not allow ISIS to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria,” said Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, the head of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the region. “All organizations in Syria should know that we will hold them accountable if they partner with or support ISIS in any way.”</p><p>The situation for the United States is all the more complicated by its own transition in Washington. Mr. Biden has just six weeks left in office before turning over the White House to President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has taken pride in his role in defeating the Islamic State in his first term while otherwise agitating to stay uninvolved in Syria.</p><p>In his only comments after Mr. al-Assad’s fall on Sunday, Mr. Trump gave little clue to his thinking about Syria’s future. Instead, he cast the matter entirely in terms of its implications for Russia, which had propped up Mr. al-Assad for nearly a decade but essentially left him to his own fate in recent days while it remains tied down in Ukraine.</p><p>“Assad is gone,” Mr. Trump wrote on his social media site. “He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He added that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia should now pursue peace talks over Ukraine. “There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin,” he wrote. “Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse. I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act.”</p><p>Mr. Biden left no doubt about American satisfaction over Mr. al-Assad’s ouster. The Syrian president has been a crushing ruler of his own people, held responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 people and the displacement of millions more during a civil war he waged to hold on to power. He has used chemical weapons on his own people and been a source of major instability in the region. As far back as 2011, President Barack Obama called on Mr. al-Assad to go and later drew a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons that he did not enforce.</p><p>“At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,” Mr. Biden said in his televised remarks from the Roosevelt Room. “This regime brutalized and tortured and killed literally hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians. The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice. It’s a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud county. It’s also a moment of risk and uncertainty.”</p><p>Indeed, as U.S. policymakers have learned through painful experience in other places in the past couple of decades, places like Libya, Egypt, Iraq and Afghanistan, the demise of a loathsome dictator does not necessarily lead to a friendlier, more democratic, more stable government in his place.</p><p>The rebel groups have united under the leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Once seen as one of the rebellion’s most powerful extremist factions, the group later tried to play down its radical aspects and focused on building something like a civilian government — albeit an authoritarian and extremist one — in the patch of territory that it has controlled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>U.S. intelligence agencies and top officials in the Biden administration are still in the process of evaluating the group and its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, who is eager for legitimacy and has mounted what one senior U.S. official characterized as a “charm offensive” aimed at allaying concerns about the organization’s intentions and past affiliations.</p><p>The way the official put it, “A charm offensive might mean that people are turning over a new leaf and they think differently than they used to, so you should hear them out. On the other hand, you should be cautious because charm offensives can sometimes be misleading.”</p><p>U.S. officials said that the Biden administration was allowed to talk to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its leader even though they are on the terrorist list, but that it could not provide them with material support.</p><p>While the Biden administration has so far stopped short of directly talking to the group, it has been working closely and directly with the U.S. military’s main counterterrorism partner in Syria, a Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces.</p><p>According to U.S. officials, the administration encouraged and provided intelligence support to the Kurds for its operations to take control of Syrian territory in eastern Syria, including the cities Deir al-Zour and Abu Kamal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The officials said the operations were meant to ensure that the Islamic State could not take advantage of the situation and seize the areas as Syrian government forces withdrew. According to a U.S. official, the message that the United States sent to the Kurds was, “If the regime vacates territory, it’s going to go to somebody, so you should fill the vacuum yourself rather than let ISIS fill into that vacuum.”</p><p>Mr. Biden said he was sending officials to the Middle East and would personally speak with leaders from the region in the coming days. He expressed commitment to helping Israel, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon as they cope with the possible spillover effects of the turmoil in Syria.</p><p>While Mr. al-Assad is reported to have now fled to Moscow, where he is being given asylum, Mr. Biden said the deposed Syrian leader should not be allowed impunity after years of crimes. “Assad should be held accountable,” he said.</p><p>In his remarks, Mr. Biden mentioned Austin Tice, the American journalist who has been held in Syria for a dozen years. Asked by reporters about Mr. Tice’s fate after turning from his microphone, Mr. Biden paused before walking out to say: “We believe he’s alive. We think we can get him back.”</p><p>After years of trying to manage foreign crises that cost his party in last month’s election, won by Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden sought to take a share of credit for Mr. al-Assad’s downfall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>He said the victory of the rebel forces over Mr. al-Assad’s government was made possible by the collapse of his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/world/europe/russia-syria-assad-putin.html" title="">support from Russia</a>, Iran and Hezbollah, all of which the United States had a hand in. He noted that U.S. military aid and diplomatic support for Ukraine and Israel had bogged down Russian forces in Europe, helped destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon and thwarted two attacks by Iran on Israel. As a result, none could help Mr. al-Assad survive.</p><p>“Over the last week, their support collapsed, all three of them, because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office,” Mr. Biden said.</p><p>“The upshot of this is for the first time ever, neither Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this horrible regime in Syria,” he added. “This is a direct result of the blows” inflicted by Ukraine and Israel “with the support of the United States.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
