Hamas agreed to incrementally release 33 out of almost 100 remaining hostages in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel and a partial Israeli withdrawal.</p><p>The young women were working as “spotters” for Israel’s army, reporting on suspicious activity across the border. During the Hamas-led attack, militants stormed the Nahal Oz military base in Israel, killing more than 50 soldiers and abducting the women, all of them teenagers at the time, and three other female soldiers.</p><p>In May, the Israel military released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostage-video.html" title="">three-minute edited collection of videos</a>, verified by The New York Times, showing Palestinian fighters, some wearing Hamas headbands, binding the hands of five women, including the four being released on Saturday. The footage was recorded by body cameras worn by the Hamas militants who abducted them, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents relatives of many of the captives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is what else we know about the four released hostages:</p><h2 id="link-1d67e063">Liri Albag</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Liri Albag, a soldier who was seized from her army base in southern Israel during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, pictured in this photograph released by Bring Them Home Now.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>In January, Hamas’s military wing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-hostage.html" title="">released an edited video</a> of Ms. Albag, now 19, speaking for three and a half minutes, in which she said she had been held for more than 450 days.</p><p>In a statement, Ms. Albag’s family said that “her severe psychological distress is evident” in the video and asked leaders to “make decisions as if your own children were there.”</p><p>“She is just dozens of kilometers away from us, yet for 456 days we have been unable to bring her home,” the family said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-68577222">Karina Ariev</h2><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Karina Ariev, a soldier who turned 20 in captivity, pictured in this photograph released by Bring Them Home Now.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Ms. Ariev, now 20, called her parents during the attack, describing militants firing guns and rockets, and told them she loved them, according to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/taken-captive-karina-ariev-told-parents-continue-your-lives/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Israeli news media</a>.
