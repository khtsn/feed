The resulting race recalled the days of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the dictator who ruled Tunisia from 1987 until his overthrow in 2011, rather than the competitive elections of the years in between, when Tunisia was working to develop a full-fledged democracy.</p><p>Mr. Saied captured more than 89 percent of the vote over Ayachi Zammel, the imprisoned candidate, and Zouhair Maghzaoui, a leftist who had previously supported Mr. Saied before running to replace him, according to exit polls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But turnout was roughly half what it was in the last presidential election, according to figures released by the government commission that oversees elections — the latest sign that the country’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/world/middleeast/tunisia-democracy.html" title="">multiplying crises</a> have damaged Tunisians’ faith in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/world/middleeast/tunisia-president-kais-saied.html" title="">president</a> many once idolized, even though they see no real alternative to him among the country’s weak and fractious political opposition.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Saied leaving a polling station in Tunis on Sunday.

But the country’s meek Parliament, which no longer serves as a counterweight to the president, later stripped the court of power over electoral matters.</p><p>Vowing to restore the ideals of the revolution, Mr. Saied says he is acting to save Tunisia from unnamed traitors and conspirators.</p><p>“We’re going to cleanse the country of all the corrupt and schemers,” Mr. Saied said at his campaign headquarters on Monday evening, according to state television broadcasts.</p><p>Yet the low turnout indicated that Mr. Saied is no longer trusted as a savior.</p><p>If the exit polls are right, Mr. Saied’s huge margin of victory was even more lopsided than when he first won office with about <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/14/tunisia-presidential-election-kais-saied-declared-winner" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">73 percent of the vote</a>.</p><p>About half the electorate voted in the first round of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/world/middleeast/tunisia-presidential-election.html" title="">the 2019 race</a>.

The electoral commission also restricted candidate spending to the point that Mr. Abdeljawad could not drive his own car to campaign headquarters because government officials would mark down use of the vehicle as a significant campaign expenditure, he said.</p><p>Tunisians had grown so fearful of opposing the president that the campaign had not been able to convince people to canvass openly for Mr. Zammel, even if they said they would vote for him, Mr. Abdeljawad said.</p><p>“Kais Saied doesn’t believe in elections,” he said. “He only organized them on this date because he had to. He hollowed the elections out.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Yee is a Times reporter covering North Africa and the broader Middle East.
