I have no doubt that America is in a position to continue to succeed. That’s why in my farewell address tonight I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern. An oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy. I’m equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech- industrial complex. Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power. In the age of A.I., it’s more important than ever that the people must govern. The existential threat of climate change has never been clearer. Just look across the country, from California to North Carolina. That’s why I signed the most significant climate and clean energy law ever. It will take time to feel the full impact of all we’ve done together. But the seeds are planted, and they’ll grow and they’ll bloom for decades to come. After 50 years of public service, I give you my word. I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands. A nation where the strength of our institutions and the character of our people matter and must endure. Now it’s your turn to stand guard. May you all be the keeper of the flame. May you keep the faith. I love America. You love it too. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you for this great honor.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/multimedia/15biden-farewell-address-BN-Email/15transition-news-reporter-updates-vzfh-threeByTwoLargeAt2X-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Speaking from the Oval Office, the president warned of a rising oligarchy, a potential tech-industrial complex and the threat of the climate crisis in his farewell address to the nation.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green"><img alt="Erica L.

Are they really populists intent on shaking up the government to benefit working people who have been left behind by the establishment? Or are they just billionaire disrupters out to enrich themselves?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Biden’s warning of an unelected oligarchy taking shape echoed a similar one by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who spoke about the military-industrial complex in his farewell address. The Biden version referred to the “tech-industrial complex,” in which he warned of the erosion of truth itself, brought forth by unchecked social media platforms — a reference to Meta doing away with fact-checkers this week — and artificial intelligence.</p><p>“Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power,” Mr. Biden said.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
