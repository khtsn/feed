Intelligence officials also said defense firms should be extra watchful for potential disruptions and should increase their physical and online security.</p><p>In addition to protecting sites, the center suggested bolstering personal security for executives and other key employees.</p><p>The warning, according to people briefed on the matter, was spurred in part by concern about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/russia-assassination-plot-germany.html" title="">a Russian attempt to assassinate the head of a German arms maker</a>.</p><p>In the notice published on Thursday, the center said defense company officials should be careful when discussing travel plans, vary their routes to and from work, and report suspicious incidents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Those involved in work tied to Ukraine or other geopolitical conflicts should be cautious about disclosing work, travel, personal and family information online,” the warning said. “Adversaries can use this information to identify access, location and personal vulnerabilities.”</p><p>The warning highlighted Britain’s arrest of several people in an arson attack in March on a business linked to Ukraine, and Poland’s announcement in June that it had arrested 18 people accused of plotting sabotage attacks on behalf of Russia.</p><p>In addition, Western officials previously warned that Russia had plotted to plant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/europe/russia-plot-dhl-planes.html" title="">incendiary devices in cargo planes</a> and was potentially planning to set off those devices in U.S. warehouses or on planes bound for the United States.</p><p>So far all of Russia’s known sabotage attacks have taken place in Europe, although Russian intelligence has targeted many countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Lithuania and beyond. But some officials believe that Russia wants to expand its sabotage campaign to the United States, particularly if the Biden administration in its closing weeks continues to support Ukraine in its war against Russia or takes steps that Russia sees as escalatory.</p><p><a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/lackawanna-county/small-fire-damages-scranton-army-ammunition-plant-cedar-avenue-lackawanna-county-general-dynamics/523-e6572736-e945-4d22-919b-10f794e55bcb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A small fire at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant</a> in Pennsylvania in September, and another incident at the same site in April, set off concerns that Russia had extended its campaign to the United States.
