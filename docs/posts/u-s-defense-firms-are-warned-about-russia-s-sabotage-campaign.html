    <h1>U.S. Defense Firms Are Warned About Russia’s Sabotage Campaign</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Those involved in work tied to Ukraine or other geopolitical conflicts should be cautious about disclosing work, travel, personal and family information online,” the warning said. “Adversaries can use this information to identify access, location and personal vulnerabilities.”</p><p>The warning highlighted Britain’s arrest of several people in an arson attack in March on a business linked to Ukraine, and Poland’s announcement in June that it had arrested 18 people accused of plotting sabotage attacks on behalf of Russia.</p><p>In addition, Western officials previously warned that Russia had plotted to plant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/world/europe/russia-plot-dhl-planes.html" title="">incendiary devices in cargo planes</a> and was potentially planning to set off those devices in U.S. warehouses or on planes bound for the United States.</p><p>So far all of Russia’s known sabotage attacks have taken place in Europe, although Russian intelligence has targeted many countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Lithuania and beyond. But some officials believe that Russia wants to expand its sabotage campaign to the United States, particularly if the Biden administration in its closing weeks continues to support Ukraine in its war against Russia or takes steps that Russia sees as escalatory.</p><p><a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/lackawanna-county/small-fire-damages-scranton-army-ammunition-plant-cedar-avenue-lackawanna-county-general-dynamics/523-e6572736-e945-4d22-919b-10f794e55bcb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A small fire at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant</a> in Pennsylvania in September, and another incident at the same site in April, set off concerns that Russia had extended its campaign to the United States. But officials believe those fires were an accident, not sabotage.</p></div></div>
