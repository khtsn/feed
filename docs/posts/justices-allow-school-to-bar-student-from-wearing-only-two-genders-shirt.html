Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the court should have agreed to take the case and ruled for the student on free speech grounds.</p><p>“If a school sees fit to instruct students of a certain age on a social issue like L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights or gender identity,” Justice Alito wrote, “then the school must tolerate dissenting student speech on those issues.”</p><p>The opinion illustrated a split among the members of the court’s six-member conservative supermajority, said Justin Driver, a law professor at Yale.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The dissent both illuminates and underscores a significant divide among the six Republican-appointed justices,” he said, “with Alito and Thomas comfortable voicing positions that the other four would prefer to avoid.”</p><p>There was a similar split in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-291_5i26.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second case the justices declined to hear</a> on Tuesday, as they let stand a ruling clearing the way for copper mining on sacred Indian land. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, the court’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-opinions.html" title="">most committed supporter of Native American rights</a>, issued a dissent joined by Justice Thomas. Justice Alito recused himself but did not say why.</p><p>The case from Massachusetts involved a student identified in court papers as L.M. who tried to wear the shirt at Nichols Middle School in Middleborough in 2023. When students and a teacher complained, the principal told the student that he could not return to class unless he changed clothes. He refused and was sent home.</p><p>Later, the student came to school wearing a T-shirt that this time said “There Are CENSORED Genders.” He was told that was not permitted, either. Rather than missing more school, he changed clothes.</p><p>His parents sued, saying the school’s policy violated the First Amendment. They relied on a landmark 1969 Supreme Court decision, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/393/503" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a>, which held that public school students have First Amendment rights. In that case, students sought to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Justice Abe Fortas, writing for the majority, said students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” But he added that disruptive speech could be punished.</p><p>In the Massachusetts case, a federal trial judge ruled for the school, saying that the student’s shirts had invaded the rights of other students. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, <a href="https://adfmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LM-AppellateRuling.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affirmed that ruling</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/david-j-barron" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Judge David J. Barron</a>, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, said the school could ban messages that demean other students’ deeply rooted characteristics in a way that poisons the educational atmosphere.</p><p>Justice Alito wrote that the First Circuit’s approach was at odds with Tinker and violated the First Amendment’s prohibition of viewpoint discrimination by the government.</p><p>“Like the black armbands in Tinker, L.M.’s shirts were a ‘silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance,’” he wrote, quoting from the decision. “And just as in Tinker, some of L.M.’s classmates found his speech upsetting. Feeling upset, however, is an unavoidable part of living in our ‘often disputatious’ society, and Tinker made abundantly clear that the ‘mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint’ is no reason to thwart a student’s speech.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Justice Alito added that the Massachusetts school “promotes the view that gender is a fluid construct” and should allow other perspectives. “If anything, viewpoint discrimination in the lower grades is more objectionable because young children are more impressionable and thus more susceptible to indoctrination,” he wrote.</p><p>The court will soon decide a case on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/supreme-court-lgbtq-books.html" title="">a related question</a>: whether public schools in Maryland must allow parents with religious objections to withdraw their children from classes in which storybooks with L.G.B.T.Q.+ themes are discussed.</p><p>Professor Driver said that “Justice Alito’s emphasizing the dangers of ‘indoctrination’ of younger students could well preview a theme” in the Maryland case.</p><p>In addition to joining Justice Alito’s dissent, Justice Thomas, long a skeptic of minors’ First Amendment rights, wrote separately to say that he believed that Tinker should be overruled. “But, unless and until this court revisits it, Tinker is binding precedent that lower courts must faithfully apply,” he wrote.</p><p>Conservatives were also divided in another case the court declined to hear on Tuesday. In that case, a Native American group lodged a religious objection to a plan to transfer federal land in Arizona slated to become one of the largest copper mines in the United States. In dissent, Justice Gorsuch wrote that his colleagues had made a grave error.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“While this court enjoys the power to choose which cases it will hear,” he wrote, “its decision to shuffle this case off our docket without a full airing is a grievous mistake — one with consequences that threaten to reverberate for generations.”</p><p>The challenge concerned the Oak Flat section of the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/tonto/home" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tonto National Forest</a>, east of Phoenix, for use as the planned Resolution Copper Mine. The Interior Department’s <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2015-oak-flat-apache-leap-historic-designation/8b386f81be376d41/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Register of Historic Places lists</a> said the area was “a holy place and ancestral homeland to the Western Apache Indians” that is also “a venue for ongoing Apache participation in traditional social activities, and is associated with traditions rooted in the history” of the tribe.</p><p>Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit group, sued the federal government to block the transfer, arguing that the mine would lead to the “irreversible destruction of one of the most sacred Indigenous sites in the country.”</p><p>Justice Gorsuch wrote that “the government and a mining conglomerate want to turn Oak Flat into a massive hole in the ground,” adding that “they plan to blast tunnels that will result in a crater perhaps 1,000 feet deep and nearly two miles wide.”</p><p>“Before allowing the government to destroy the Apaches’ sacred site,” he wrote, “this court should at least have troubled itself to hear their case.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/sidebar">Sidebar,</a> a column on legal developments.
