	    <div><div><p>The Cost of Wooing Hollywood</p></div>  <div><div id="q-a-card-0"><div><h2>How much money have states been spending?</h2>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Over the last 20 years, states have given movie and television productions more than $25 billion in filming incentives. Thirty-eight states currently offer some form of incentive. Georgia’s lauded program has poured more than $5 billion into Hollywood since 2015. New York has spent at least $7 billion, and California has dedicated more than $3 billion to try to retain productions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </div><div id="q-a-card-1"><div><h2>Why do states want to encourage filming?</h2>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Supporters of film incentives see them as an engine for job creation. After all, when productions come to town, they need electricians, hair stylists and many other crew members to make movie magic. Productions also spend money while working — money that trickles through local economies to hotels, diners and dry cleaners.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </div><div id="q-a-card-2"><div><h2>Are there any downsides?</h2>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Incentives can be effective at luring projects. But economists warn that using them to do so is very expensive and offers minimal bang for your buck. Study after study has found that the tax revenue generated by film incentive programs is a quarter, or even a dime, of every dollar invested.  In some programs, each job that is directly created can cost taxpayers more than $100,000.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </div><div id="q-a-card-3"><div><h2>And yet states are handing out cash?</h2>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Incentives come in different forms. Many states do offer cash rebates or grants, which are paid out directly to production companies. Other states give some form of a tax credit. Depending on the state, tax credits can be used toward tax liability, converted into a refund or sold.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </div><div id="q-a-card-4"><div><h2>Wait, studios sell their tax credits?</h2>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Yes. Many states offer a transferable tax credit. Studios can then sell those credits to companies with high state-tax liabilities. By selling them, often at a slight discount, studios can cash out and buyers can receive modest tax relief. As a result, companies with minimal ties to the entertainment industry have become a hidden part of the incentive ecosystem.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </div><div id="q-a-card-5"><div><h2>Who’s buying these credits?</h2>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Companies like Best Buy, U.S. Bank and Dr Pepper buy these tax credits from productions. High-net-worth individuals also sometimes purchase them. Consider one example: The production company behind “The Trial of the Chicago 7” received a $5.2 million tax credit from New Jersey that it sold to Apple Inc. for $4.8 million.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </div><div id="q-a-card-6"><div><h2>Can we track where all this money is going?</h2>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s hard. This process involves vast sums of tax revenue that states are owed but never collect. Because the money does not come into the state treasury to begin with, it is less obvious that the revenue has been lost. And that can make transferable tax credits politically palatable.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </div></div>  </div>

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Officials in California, who have seen Hollywood productions flock to other states and last year witnessed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/wga-writers-strike-hollywood.html" title="">lengthy strikes by writers</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/media/actors-strike-deal.html" title="">actors</a>, have dedicated more than $3 billion to retain film productions in that time frame. But state officials say that the $330 million annual limit is reached quickly and that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/movies/rosemead-film-tax-credits.html" title="">productions have learned to look elsewhere</a>.</p><p>California’s budget <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/us/california-budget-explainer.html" title="">has been significantly stretched</a>, with state finance officials projecting a shortfall next year. But Mr. Newsom’s proposal is likely to receive significant backing from organized labor, a powerful state lobby, and from the governor’s fellow Democrats, who hold a supermajority of legislative seats. Legislators easily passed a five-year extension of the existing film tax credit program last year.</p><p>Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, who championed the tax credit program in 2009, when she was speaker of the California Assembly, said that expanding the incentive had been at the top of the priority list for entertainment industry leaders. Los Angeles, she said, “still has not recovered from the strike.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Colleen Bell, executive director of the California Film Commission, said she had experienced a wave of relief when she heard of the governor’s proposal.</p><p>“We’re losing our market share and there’s no reason,” she said in an interview. “Production companies are just seeking these tax credits. It’s not enough anymore just to be the state with the best crews and the best weather and the best locations.”</p><p>It is unclear how far tax incentives will go to address show business worries in California. Lost production has been only one disruption among many, including the aftermath of crippling shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/business/economy/artificial-intelligence-hollywood-unions.html" title="">threat of job losses</a> because of technological changes such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>Data released last week <a href="https://filmla.com/greater-los-angeles-film-industry-survives-its-second-slowest-summer/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by FilmLA</a>, the official film office of the City and County of Los Angeles, indicated that the 5,048 “shoot days” recorded in the Los Angeles area in the three-month period that ended on Sept. 30 lagged even the 5,311 figure from the same period in 2023, when a screenwriters strike contributed to a shutdown of many television and film productions.</p><p>Government officials say that tax incentives for film and television productions trickle down to local economies. Creating movie magic requires electricians, hair stylists and other types of skilled workers. Money is also spent on hotels, dry cleaning and dining out.</p><p>Economists have largely voiced skepticism, warning that states receive a poor return on such investments. Studies have shown that tax revenue generated by film incentive programs amounts to a quarter, or even a dime, of every dollar invested, and in some cases each job created can cost taxpayers more than $100,000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>A 2023 <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/research/economic-impact-of-tax-incentive-programs.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report from the New York State of Department of Taxation and Finance</a> found that the return on its incentive program, which has an annual cap of $700 million, was between 15 cents and 31 cents on the dollar. “The film production credit is at best a break-even proposition and more likely a net cost” to the state, the report said.</p><p>Joseph Chianese, a senior vice president and production incentives practice leader at Entertainment Partners, a Hollywood management firm, said in a statement that California’s existing $330 million annual cap could put it at a competitive disadvantage when other states and countries have higher limits.</p><p>“Producers prioritize stability in incentives, especially in terms of legislative consistency, transparent processes and reliable funding,” he said.</p><p>“Nonetheless,” he added, “California remains a vital hub with unmatched crew expertise, infrastructure and leadership in industry technology development, which remains an attractive option for many producers.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shawn Hubler is based in Sacramento and covers California news, policy trends and personalities.
