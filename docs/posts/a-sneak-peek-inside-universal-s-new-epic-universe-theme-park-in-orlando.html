    <h1>A Sneak Peek Inside Universal’s New Epic Universe Theme Park in Orlando</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Believe the hype: <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/tickets-packages/park-tickets/epic-products" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Epic Universe,</a> the first major new theme park to open in Central Florida in 26 years, lives up to its name and then some.</p><p>Honestly, I’m as shocked as you are.</p><p>But epic-ness was indeed my takeaway after recently spending two days inside Epic Universe as part of “technical rehearsals,” a type of soft opening. When it officially debuts on May 22, the estimated $7 billion-plus property should narrow the gap between the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/business/universal-theme-parks-expansion-disney.html" title="">Universal</a> Orlando Resort, long the challenger brand in Orlando’s <a href="https://www.visitorlando.org/about/corporate-blog/post/central-floridas-tourism-industry-hits-record-925-billion-in-economic-impact/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$92.5 billion</a> tourism market, and Walt Disney World, which has dominated since arriving in 1971.</p><p>Epic Universe, eight years in the making and sprawling across more than 100 acres, represents a dramatic evolution for Universal, and in some ways, the American theme park industry. It’s more interactive, a reflection of consumer obsession with instant gratification and personalization. It’s also more immersive, with layer upon layer of storytelling from the front gates to the furthest corner. The theming extends far beyond rides to include things like music, smells, landscaping, food, cutlery, staff uniforms and even toilets (they’re black in an area dedicated to movie monsters).</p><p>Epic Universe will use a facial recognition system at its entrance plaza: No more fumbling with tickets or digital fingerprinting. The aim is to speed entry. Facial recognition will also be used for lockers and at express lanes for rides.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Adult single-day tickets start at $139 and go up to $199 during peak holiday periods.

There are a few shops at the entrance. But visitors are not subjected to the usual avenue of stores hawking overpriced tchotchkes. Instead, you immediately enter a vast area of actual parkland: trees, flowers, grass, meandering paths, circular “tide pools.” This section, Celestial Park, also features <a href="https://bellagio.mgmresorts.com/en/entertainment/fountains-of-bellagio.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bellagio-style</a> dancing fountains, with some jets reaching 135 feet in the air; four walk-up bars; a smattering of restaurants; and concierge booths for phone charging, locker rental, information and perhaps an emergency Band-Aid.</p><p>“We wanted to put the park back in theme park,” Mark Woodbury, chairman of <a href="https://corporate.universaldestinationsandexperiences.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences</a>, told me as we stood on an overlook. Part of the goal is to slow you down and make Epic Universe feel like less of a mad dash from ride to ride.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Tunnels called portals connect Celestial Park with four areas — essentially mini theme parks with rides, shops, restaurants, costumed characters and interactive games. One area, Isle of Berk, is based on the “How to Train Your Dragon” movie franchise. Another, Dark Universe, is home to classic ogres like Frankenstein’s monster. “Harry Potter” gets a portal, as do characters from Nintendo games.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Burning Blade Tavern is themed as a corner bar for vampire hunters. Its food menu includes cheese balls disguised as charcoal briquettes.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Universal hopes that with the park’s addition, families will view the Universal Orlando Resort as a weeklong destination and not just a one- or two-day add-on to a Disney vacation. (Universal Orlando will consist of four parks and 11 hotels.)</p><p>But the magnetic poles in Orlando are not going to reverse: Disney, which attracts roughly 50 million guests annually to its Florida parks, has too powerful of a hold on childhoods. Also, Disney World remains comparatively colossal consisting of six parks and more than 25 hotels. Disney, which recently announced <a href="https://disneyparksblog.com/wdw/disney-world-announces-new-family-deals-for-summer-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summer deals</a>, also has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/disney-parks-new-rides.html" title="">new rides</a> on the way.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Toy wands get a major upgrade at Epic Universe, with lights and haptic effects like vibration.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Universal has a history of rocky openings.</p><p>Among theme park fans, the company is still remembered for its <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1990/06/08/opening-day-goes-bust/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">botched 1990 arrival</a> in Central Florida; major rides malfunctioned on opening day. And in 2010, when it opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a 20-acre addition to an older park, there was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/business/19potter.html" title="">six-hour wait</a> just to get inside the gate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Universal seems to be leaving nothing to chance this time around, hence the lengthy soft opening. I’m not sure about crowd control in those tunnels, though. They’re so cool that selfie traffic jams are bound to happen.</p><p>Here, a guide for what you can expect:</p><h2 id="link-456c2bdf">Celestial Park</h2><p>Celestial Park is conceived as the “cosmic heart” of the Epic Universe experience, and its ornamental architecture was inspired by <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/pavilions-from-world-expos-1851-2021-royal-institute-of-british-architects/8gXB5ZWjmuyElg?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Expo</a> designs from the 1800s. It includes an actual hotel, the luxury <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/places-to-stay/universal-helios-grand-hotel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Helios Grand,</a> which looms at one end. Rooms start at $490 and provide instant access: Just walk out the front door and start riding.</p><p>In the evenings, Celestial Park will feature fireworks and light shows. Universal says there are seven million individually programmable LED lights embedded in the area. (The evening displays were not running on the days I was there.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of the Helios Grand Hotel in Celestial Park, an area with dancing fountains that is accented by Greek and Roman mythology.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-14"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One restaurant tries to make you feel as if you’re inside an aquarium.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The décor inside Helios, a Loews hotel, is a reference to the heavens.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Stardust Racers is a classic roller coaster whose cars hit 62 miles an hour as it twists and turns you upside down. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Constellation Carousel, a new twist on a classic, sits between tide pools under a dome of blue glass. To one side sprawls Stardust Racers, a dual-launch roller coaster that hits 62 m.p.h. and aims to make you feel as if you’re riding a comet. (Perhaps don’t hop on it first thing in the morning as I did.)</p><h2 id="link-1aa8ca9f">Dark Universe</h2><p>Of all the portals, Universal was the most unsure of this one. Classic movie monsters? Like, from the 1930s?</p><p>Perhaps overcompensating, the company built an ultra-elaborate ride called Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment. After making your way through a foreboding Frankenstein Manor, which is rigged with bright blue electrical lines, you hop in vehicles connected to robotic arms and zoom through catacombs where experiments have gone terrifyingly awry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The entrance to the Frankenstein Experiment ride has a booming soundtrack and glowing cables that give the illusion of pulsing electricity.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-20"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A violinist adds to an anxiety-ridden atmosphere.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Invisible Man is among the themed characters who wander Dark Universe.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frankenstein Manor and other buildings in Dark Universe were inspired by old horror movies. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Cut to a revolt of enraged monsters like the Wolf Man, the Mummy and the Creature From the Black Lagoon. The ride blends digital effects with physical sets and animatronic figures, including a nine-foot-tall Frankenstein’s monster that weighs 800 pounds and can walk. There are also flying Draculas. (Yes, plural.) The ride is destined for the theme park hall of fame. It’s that good.</p><p>Dark Universe is populated with walk-around characters like the Invisible Man and Ygor, who carries a suitcase filled with bloody limbs. A beauty parlor offers monster makeovers ($45 for face paint, $169 if you want a full costume).</p><h2 id="link-75592df5">Super Nintendo World</h2><p>This colorful and kinetic area was mobbed, with families running maniacally through obstacle courses to collect digital coins using a Power-Up Band ($42) and the Universal app. It looked as if they were having the time of their lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-24"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/05trav-universal-epic-23311-cover/05trav-universal-epic-23311-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/05trav-universal-epic-23311-cover/05trav-universal-epic-23311-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/03/137027_1_05trav-universal-epic-23311_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">In Super Nintendo Word, giant coins twirl, piranha plants chomp, power-up mushrooms slide and the Super Mario Bros. theme song bah-bah-bumps.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>It was too much for me, but I’m not a gamer. It was also 90 degrees, and there are no trees for shade in the front section.

Gothi’s Hut from “How to Train Your Dragon” sits atop a towering faux mountain. Real wooden ships navigate an icy fjord. Shops sell dragon eggs that hatch. A tavern serves frosty Yaknog, which tastes like malted chocolate and cinnamon. One ride simulates dragon flight while a family-friendly coaster dips and glides around the landscape.</p><p>“Watch out for dragon drool,” a voice intones as you step off it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-31"><div><figcaption><span>Isle of Berk has a 1,200-seat theater that houses a Broadway-style musical in which Toothless the dragon flies over the audience, 27-foot wings flapping, with the character Hiccup aboard.</span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>There are 31 animatronic dragons on the prowl here, including free-roaming babies. Universal is working on two dragons that will fly overhead using drone technology, at least one of which may <em>breathe fire</em>.</p><h2 id="link-59e8da86">The Ministry of Magic</h2><p>This is the pièce de résistance. Universal already does Harry Potter exceptionally well at its older parks. But this addition, themed predominantly to 1920s Paris, is the only Wizarding World to feature characters from two sets of movies: the original “Harry Potter” blockbusters and the spinoff “Fantastic Beasts” series.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Ministry of Magic area takes its aesthetic from 1920s Paris.

Perhaps to offset her severe personality, the ride adds a new character, a house elf named Higgledy.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-36"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The tiled queue area for Battle at the Ministry is lavish to the point of extreme.
