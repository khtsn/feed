    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><div id="in-story-masthead"><div><div><p><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/briefing/the-connections-bot.html</span></p></div></div></div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>WordleBot, introduced in 2022, has become one of the The Times’s most popular features. Every month, it receives millions of visits from readers who want feedback on their attempt to solve each day’s five-letter word.</p><p>Now the designers of that bot have created a new one — for the Connections game. I know that The Morning’s audience includes many passionate game players, and I want to devote today’s holiday newsletter to a quick description of the new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/upshot/connections-bot.html" title="">Connections Bot</a>.</p><p>It also has a larger significance: It includes the first English text generated by A.I. that The Times newsroom will regularly publish.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-340070c6">The purple bonus</h2><p>I’ve had access to an internal version of the bot in recent weeks and have had fun playing with it. (If you don’t yet play Connections, a very brief description is: You must separate 16 terms into four categories, with four terms in each category, and there is only one solution that works. The trick is that one category — as you can see below with this “STADIUMS” category — often has five or more potential answers.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As with Wordle, you first play the game and then visit the bot for feedback. Once you do, you find out how your performance compared with that of other players, and you receive a skill score, up to 99. It’s based mostly on how many mistakes you made, but it also awards extra credit if you started by solving what the Times Games team considers to be the hardest categories — starting with the purple category and followed by blue.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>(Related: Connections die-hards may enjoy watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUnkW3fL0Io" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this video by Hank Green</a>, a writer who developed his own “hard mode” for Connections, which requires solving purple first.)</p><p>After the bot gives you a skill score and some other information, the A.I. feature comes next. It uses artificial intelligence to guess what players were thinking when they made incorrect guesses. I find it delightful:</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>I asked Eve Washington — a graphics editor with The Times’s Upshot section, who helped create the bot — what surprised her about the process, and she told me that it helped her feel better about the days when she doesn’t solve the puzzle. “Connections can be a hard game!” Eve said, pointing out that the solve rate is below 50 percent some days.</p><p>“But knowing that most people were feeling stuck reminded me I was not alone, and made the game more fun,” Eve added. “It took the pressure off of playing a perfect game and instead created joy in discovering all of the unique ways that people tried to reason through the puzzle.”</p><p>When I asked her what she hoped other people would get from the bot, Eve replied, “I hope that people feel seen by the bot.”</p><p><strong>Next steps: </strong>You can read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/upshot/connections-bot-faq.html" title="">a user guide’s to the bot</a>, written by my colleagues at The Upshot — or you can simply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections" title="">play Connections</a> and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/upshot/connections-bot.html" title="">visit the bot</a>.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-17445b95">Israel-Hamas War</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters in Israel. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Kyiv. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oksana Parafeniuk for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tim Walz</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Eden Bowen Montgomery, an interior designer. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andrea Morales for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Coco Gauff and Emma Navarro.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Squire/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p><strong>U.S. Open: </strong>The<strong> </strong>American Emma Navarro ousted defending champion Coco Gauff in front of a star-studded crowd. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5738443/2024/09/01/coco-gauff-us-open-result-emma-navarro/" title="">Read a recap</a>.</p><p><strong>W.N.B.A.: </strong>Chicago Sky star Angel Reese set the league’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5738326/2024/09/01/angel-reese-sky-wnba-rebound-record/" title="">single-season rebounding record</a>.</p><p><strong>College football:</strong> U.S.C. outlasted L.S.U. in the holiday weekend’s last premier game, 27-20.
