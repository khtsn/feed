Mr. Rhodes, who was serving an 18-year term on similar charges, had his sentence commuted to time served and was freed from a prison in Cumberland, Md.</p><p>Defense lawyers said that another member of the Proud Boys, Joseph Biggs, who was one of Mr. Tarrio’s co-defendants, was also released after Mr. Trump commuted his sentence. Mr. Biggs had been serving 17 years in prison after his own conviction on seditious conspiracy charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Additional members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were expected to be freed in the coming days.</p><p>Defendants have also started to be released from the local jail in Washington, where several rioters have been held in recent years in a special area nicknamed the “patriot wing.” On Monday night, two brothers from Pennsylvania, Matthew and Andrew Valentin, were set free, only days after being sentenced to two and a half years each on charges of assaulting the police.</p><p>“They helped break the police line by shoving a metal barricade into officers, and Matthew Valentin violently grabbed an officer’s neck,” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo for the men. “They followed that assault by stealing police batons and berating officers.”</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
