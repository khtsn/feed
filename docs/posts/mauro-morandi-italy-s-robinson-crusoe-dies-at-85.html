He was 85.</p><p>The cause was a brain hemorrhage, said Antonio Rinaldis, who wrote a <a href="https://www.diarkos.it/index.php?r=category%2Fpage&amp;id=4622" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2023 book</a> with Mr. Morandi about his life on the island.</p><p>Unlike Daniel Defoe’s hero, who was shipwrecked and fervently hoped to be rescued, Mr. Morandi chose his life of solitude.</p><p>He said he had fallen in love at first sight with Budelli, a pristine, undeveloped island off the northern tip of Sardinia. He arrived in 1989, somewhat by chance, he said in interviews. He left — against his will — in 2021, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mauro.dabudelli/posts/2826915494217724" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing on social media</a> that he was tired of “fighting against those who want to send me away.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Morandi’s singular choice to live in solitude spawned at least two books, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyyst2w5sBc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least one song</a>, short documentaries and countless interviews. As the world turned inward during the coronavirus pandemic, reporters sought Mr. Morandi’s <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-hermit-coronavirus/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insights on isolation</a>.</p><p>“I read a lot, and think,” he told CNN in 2020. “I think many people are scared of reading because if they do, they’ll start meditating and thinking about stuff, and that can be dangerous. If you start seeing things under a different light and be critical, you could end up seeing what a miserable life you lead.”</p><p>Budelli, one of the main islands that make up the Maddalena Archipelago, is a dab of paradise occupying less than two-thirds of a square mile. It is known for its pink sand beach surrounded by turquoise water. The island has no running water, is not connected to an electrical grid and is accessible only by boat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Budelli is known for its pink sand beach surrounded by turquoise water.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luca Picciau/REDA, via Universal Images Group, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Morandi <a href="https://www.photoandpano.com/wp-content/uploads/sferiche/custode-budelli/tour.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lived</a> in an abandoned World War II hut, tacking up canvas tarps in an open area in front. He created sculptures from branches, cooked on a propane stove and read voraciously, buying books and supplies on trips to La Maddalena, the largest town on the archipelago. Visitors also brought him food and water. He used car batteries and solar power to charge his cellphone and his tablet.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It was, he said, “a simple life made up of big and small pleasures. The most important thing is that I have a serene relationship with time.”</p><p>For years, he was the island’s designated guardian, hired by the Swiss-Italian real estate company that owned it.</p><p>His main task was to protect the island’s habitat from unruly tourists, who are allowed only on certain paths, part of an effort by Italy’s environment ministry to protect the rare pink sand. He told people about the marvels of the island, and how fragments of coral and shells had turned the sand pink. He picked up trash from the beach, cleared the island’s paths and carried out light maintenance.</p><p>He initially chose to live as a hermit, he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=3321135098165264" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in an interview</a> at Genoa’s maritime museum, but he ultimately welcomed select people as part of his mission to make them “understand why we need to love nature.”</p><p>He said he did not miss human contact. “He didn’t like what humanity had become in the 21st century, consumeristic and individualistic, especially with regard to nature,” Mr. Rinaldis said. That was why he cared about protecting Budelli.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>When he finally got an internet connection, he used social media to showcase the island’s untamed beauty.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“A simple life made up of big and small pleasures,” Mr. Morandi said. “The most important thing is that I have a serene relationship with time.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michele Ardu</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In 2016, after a protracted legal battle over the island’s ownership, it was turned over to the state and became part of <a href="http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.arcip.maddalena/Eindex.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maddalena Archipelago National Park</a>. Mr. Morandi was asked to leave.</p><p>The park’s president, Giuseppe Bonanno, acknowledged Mr. Morandi’s unique position. “Morandi symbolizes a man, enchanted by the elements, who decides to devote his life to contemplation and custody,” he told reporters. But there were other issues, including whether Mr. Morandi would be able to survive a medical emergency alone, not to mention his shack’s failure to meet code.</p><p>Mr. Morandi fought back. He campaigned against his eviction on social media. He gave interviews to the news media. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/ministro-dell-ambiente-sergio-costa-mauro-il-custode-di-budelli-ancora-sotto-attacco-di-chi-lo-vuole-cacciare?source_location=search" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An online petition</a> drew nearly 75,000 signatures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We do not want Mauro to leave the island because we think first of all that if Budelli has remained a wonder of nature it is also thanks to him,” the petition said. “And second, because we are convinced that the park has everything to gain from his presence: Mauro has lived on Budelli for a quarter of a century, he knows every plant and every rock, every tree and every animal species, he recognizes the colors and scents with the changing of the wind and the seasons.”</p><p>But after battling the authorities for five years, Mr. Morandi relented. He was 82 and no longer in great health. “Part of his resignation was tied to his fragility,” Mr. Rinaldis said, “but he was also disappointed because he had been forced to leave by the authorities.”</p><p>In March 2021, he left the island for good and moved to a small apartment in La Maddalena. “I’ll leave hoping that in the future Budelli will be safeguarded like I’ve been doing it for 32 years,” he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mauro.dabudelli/posts/2826915494217724" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>Mauro Morandi was born on Feb. 12, 1939, in Modena. His father, Mario Morandi, was a gymnast who won the national championship for artistic gymnastics in 1936, and later was the caretaker of a school. His mother, Enia Camellini, worked for a tobacco company.</p><p>Mauro studied to become a physical education teacher and taught at a middle school in Modena through the 1970s, when he was able to retire early. He had three daughters during a marriage that ended in divorce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>They survive him, as do a brother, Renzo, and six grandchildren.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.lastampa.it/mare/2016/07/05/news/una-firma-per-mauro-morandi-l-anarca-di-budelli-1.34830382/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2016 interview</a> with the Turin daily La Stampa, he said that after reading Richard Bach’s 1970 best seller “Jonathan Livingston Seagull” he “took flight,” discovering the sea. In 1989, he said, he decided that he was “tired of society, and seeking a different life.” He bought a catamaran with some friends, with the idea of sailing to Polynesia.</p><p>To raise money, they scouted locations for charter cruises and came across Budelli. There, they met Budelli’s caretaker, who had recently decided to leave. He offered them his job and Mr. Morandi took it. He was paid at first, but he stayed on even after he was no longer receiving a salary, and lived off his teacher’s pension. On rare occasions, he returned to Modena for short holidays to visit his family.</p><p>At one point, he read a study by the University of Sassari showing that Budelli’s flora and fauna were similar to those of the Polynesian islands he had once hoped to reach. “It was almost as though Budelli wanted me, made sure I got here, to the only beach in the whole Mediterranean Sea which is almost similar in composition to the islands where I wanted to go,” he said <a href="https://www.photoandpano.com/wp-content/uploads/sferiche/custode-budelli/tour.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a 2016 interview</a> with the photographer Claudio Muzzetto.</p><p>After his death, Margherita Guerra, one of his many thousands of followers on social media, wrote, “Safe travels. Finally no one will ever be able to send you away from your beloved island.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
