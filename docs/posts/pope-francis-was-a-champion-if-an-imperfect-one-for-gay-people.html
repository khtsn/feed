In doing so, he signaled a desire to cast his lot with the poor and those on the margins. Few could have predicted that he would do more for one globally marginalized group — L.G.B.T.Q. people — than all his modern predecessors combined.</p><p>An obvious example of his approach was the story of Sister Jeannine Gramick. Her saga began in 1999, during the papacy of St. John Paul II. That year, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later to become Pope Benedict XVI, barred Sister Gramick and the Rev. Robert Nugent, two Americans, from ministering to “homosexual persons.” Father Nugent died in 2014. But Pope Francis called Sister Gramick, who for years was under pressure by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, a “valiant woman” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/europe/pope-francis-lgbtq-blessings.html" title="">met with her</a> in 2022, as well as last year in the company of transgender Catholics.</p><p>Francis had compassion for L.G.B.T.Q. people for many reasons. As a Jesuit, he took a person’s conscience seriously, an emphasis in Jesuit spirituality, meaning that he was less likely to condemn people seen by many previous church leaders solely as “sinners.” Increasing numbers of Catholic families with openly L.G.B.T.Q. members made the church’s attitude toward them a more pressing pastoral issue. Finally, the pope’s desire that the church be a place for <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2023/08/03/pope-francis-world-youth-day-welcome-lisbon-245791" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“todos, todos, todos”</a> — “all, all, all” —<em> </em>meant reaching out to those who felt excluded. Even if he did not change the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/catechism/en/part_three/section_two/chapter_two/article_6/ii_the_vocation_to_chastity.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">church’s official teaching</a> that homosexuality is “intrinsically disordered” and “contrary to the natural law,” Francis’ drastically new approach was itself a kind of teaching.</p><p>Those who doubt the effectiveness of his approach need only to look at the increasing number of L.G.B.T.Q. groups and retreats in many parishes, as well as prominent church leaders who have grown more vocal in their support — though still mainly in the West. In January, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, <a href="https://www.newwaysministry.org/2025/01/30/cardinal-gregorys-apology-to-lgbtq-catholics-is-a-watershed-moment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued an apology</a> for the church’s mistreatment of L.G.B.T.Q. people. For the Catholic Church’s Jubilee celebration in Rome this year, a Mass for L.G.B.T.Q. people was added to the Vatican’s official list of events.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Francis’ pastoral outreach helped L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics feel more at home in their church. But it also meant that a far larger group — their families and friends — also felt more at home. It potentially forced Catholics around the world, even in cultures where homophobia is more entrenched, to ask themselves: If Pope Francis is so welcoming, why not me?</p><p>Consider a few of the gestures that Francis made during his papacy. I believe he was the first pope to use the word “gay” publicly in reference to L.G.B.T.Q. people. Perhaps his most famous words were, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/world/europe/pope-francis-gay-priests.html" title="">“Who am I to judge?”</a> in response to a question about gay (and celibate) priests.</p><p>In 2020, he urged parents to welcome their L.G.B.T.Q. children <a href="https://www.newwaysministry.org/2020/09/18/pope-francis-to-parents-of-lgbt-children-the-church-loves-your-children-as-they-are/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“as they are.”</a> He <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/247035/pope-francis-appoints-juan-carlos-cruz-to-pontifical-commission-for-protecting-minors" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appointed</a> a friend, Juan Carlos Cruz, an openly gay man, as a member of the pontifical commission on the abuse of minors. In addition to meeting with Sister Gramick, Francis met with several other people, including me, who ministered to L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics. At the end of our <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2019/09/30/pope-francis-meets-father-james-martin-private-audience" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first meeting</a> in 2019, when I asked what I could do for him, he said, “You can continue your ministry in peace.”</p><p>Francis also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-gay-rights-ap-interview-1359756ae22f27f87c1d4d6b9c8ce212" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly opposed</a> the criminalization of homosexuality, and <a href="https://outreach.faith/2023/01/pope-francis-clarifies-comments-on-homosexuality-one-must-consider-the-circumstances/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replying to written questions</a> from <a href="https://outreach.faith/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Outreach</a>, a website for L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics that I help run, he suggested that bishops who opposed his stance were “wrong.” For Outreach’s conferences for L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics, he sent <a href="https://outreach.faith/2023/06/pope-francis-sends-greetings-to-this-years-outreach-conference-for-lgbtq-catholics/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letters of welcome</a>. And toward the end of his papacy, in a practice that received scant media attention, <a href="https://outreach.faith/2023/01/pope-francis-meets-regularly-with-transgender-catholics-at-general-audience/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he met monthly</a> with transgender Catholics.</p><p>Sometimes his moves were greeted with shrugs in Western Europe and the United States. “Not enough,” some L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics said to me. But what is tepid in the West is often white-hot elsewhere. Francis faced intense pushback for approving “Fiducia Supplicans,” the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/world/europe/pope-gay-lesbian-same-sex-blessing.html" title="">document</a> published by the Vatican’s doctrinal department that allowed priests to bless same-sex couples under certain circumstances. Many African bishops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/07/world/africa/blessing-same-sex-couples-africa-catholics.html" title="">fiercely opposed</a> the statement and essentially declared that they would refuse to follow it. Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the former head of the same Vatican office that published the document, said the new guidance on the blessing of same-sex unions was “blasphemy.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Some L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics wanted even more from Francis, hoping that he might change the church’s position on homosexuality, which the future Pope Benedict in 1986 <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20051104_istruzione_en.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> tended toward an “intrinsic moral evil.” Others hoped that the church would recognize same-sex marriages as sacramental. He did neither but instead focused on the catechism’s call to show “respect, compassion and sensitivity” to L.G.B.T.Q. people.</p><p>He also opposed “gender ideology,” even as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/europe/pope-francis-transgender-people.html" title="">he made clear</a> that transgender Catholics could serve as witnesses at church weddings and as godparents. For Francis, ideologies of any kind were suspect. He preferred to minister to people as individuals, in a pastoral setting, something he always stressed in our meetings and the notes he sent to me.</p><p>Last year, in a gathering with Italian bishops, Francis used an Italian slur (“frociaggine<em>,” </em>meaning, more or less, “faggotry”) and said gay men had no place in the priesthood. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/world/europe/pope-apology-slang-gay-men.html" title="">Vatican apologized</a> for the pope’s use of the term, although he used it again two weeks later. I was surprised by this, since it was so out of character with the man I knew. I met with him in a previously planned meeting soon after in his residence at Casa Santa Marta and we discussed his comments.</p><p>Within a few minutes, I recall that he volunteered, “Of course I know many good, holy and faithful gay priests and seminarians.” When I suggested that he might say that publicly, he told me, “You can say that I said that.” “Really?” I recall asking. “Of course! Because I do!” he replied. It also became clear in our conversation that he hadn’t known how offensive the slur was, despite the Vatican apology, and he told me he would never use it again.</p><p>Being open to listening and learning, and his desire to make the church welcoming to everyone, lay at the heart of the pope’s pastoral approach to L.G.B.T.Q. people. So besides the name of “Francis,” he can claim another title: “ally.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>James Martin, a Jesuit priest, is the editor at large of the Catholic magazine America and consultor to the Vatican’s Dicastery for Communication.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
