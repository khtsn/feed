He’s trying to set <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-eggs.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">the price of eggs</a> and other goods.</p><p>Unable to curb Hungary’s inflation rate, the highest in the European Union, and facing a surge of support for a political rival, Mr. Orban last week ordered price controls on 30 basic foodstuffs. And he accused supermarkets of price gouging, particularly on eggs and butter.</p><p>Mr. Orban said the Hungarian government would starting this week force supermarkets to bring down their prices by ensuring that what they charge for essential foods does not exceed a 10 percent markup on what they cost wholesale. The current markup for eggs, he said, was an “unacceptable” 40 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Prices don’t rise, they are raised,” Mr. Orban thundered, blaming inflation on grocery stores, the biggest of which in Hungary are foreign companies like Britain’s Tesco and Austria’s Spar.</p><p>Hungary has been hailed by many American conservatives (and President Trump) as a beacon for how a country should be run. But the move by Mr. Orban underlines how he has struggled to manage the thing many Hungarians care about most: their country’s ailing economy.</p><p>Economic troubles have weakened Mr. Orban at home and abroad. The Hungarian Economic Research Institute, an independent body, <a href="https://gki.hu/language/en/2025/01/23/gki-economic-sentiment-index-at-a-nineteen-month-low/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported recently</a> that its business confidence index had “slipped to a 50-month low.”</p><p>Those troubles have badly dented Mr. Orban’s popularity ahead of an election next year that, according to some opinion polls, his governing Fidesz party could lose to an upstart opposition movement led by Peter Magyar, a former party loyalist.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Peter Magyar, chairman of the Tisza party, at a rally in Budapest on Saturday at which he denounced Mr. Orban’s handling of the economy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Attila Kisbenedek/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Magyar has rocketed to national fame as the leader of a mass movement built on denunciations of Mr. Orban over Hungary’s “staggering cost-of-living crisis,” its faltering public services and an economic playing field tilted in favor of businesses controlled by the prime minister’s relatives and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/world/europe/hungary-orban-corruption-eu.html" title="">political allies</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In Budapest on Saturday, Mr. Magyar drew tens of thousands of anti-government protesters to a rally commemorating Hungary’s failed 1848 revolution, far more than attended a similar event held earlier in the day by Mr. Orban.</p><p>Mr. Magyar mocked Marton Nagy, the economy minister, for trying to dictate the price of sour cream, a Hungarian staple, by “circling numbers with a ballpoint pen to see how much the price can be cut” while Mr. Orban, his family and friends “become rich stealing your money.” The crowd roared.</p><p>Erika Lapos, a retiree who traveled more than 100 miles with her husband from their home in northeastern Hungary to attend Mr. Magyar’s rally, blamed corruption for the weak economy. “Is not just a scandal, it is a crime,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Orban had until recently largely succeeded in deflecting criticism of his economic record and corruption by blaming high prices on the war in Ukraine. He also sought to focus public attention on issues like illegal immigration and his false accusations that the European Union was trying to turn Hungarian children transgender or gay.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But the Ukraine war and migration no longer dominate voters’ concerns, said Agoston Mraz, director of the Nezopont Institute, which conducts polls for Mr. Orban’s government.</p><p>“The inflation issue is now the most important by far,” he said.</p><p>Still, eager to change the topic and rev up Mr. Orban’s conservative base, his supporters in Parliament on Tuesday amended a law on public assembly to ban gay pride parades, the latest in a series of efforts to target the country’s L.G.B.T.Q. community.</p><p>But there’s no escaping the economic realities.</p><p>Overall, Hungarian food prices in February, according to official figures released last week, were 7.1 percent higher than a year earlier, meaning that food is now more than 80 percent dearer than five years ago, according to calculations by ING Bank.</p><p>Mr. Mraz said that, according to his institute’s polling, Fidesz still had a solid lead over Mr. Magyar’s Tisza party but was vulnerable on the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Shopping at a supermarket in Budapest on Monday.

But investment, a key driver of future growth, has plummeted, Mr. Pogatsa said. And the hole in the budget — a gap criticized by the European Union last month as an “excessive deficit situation” — is likely to balloon if, as he did before the last election in 2022, Mr. Orban offers handouts to voters before the one next year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Budapest at night.

He did not specify how this would be done, but Hungary’s state statistics office on Wednesday said that Mr. Orban’s intervention had already lowered egg prices by nearly 20 percent.</p><p>Geza Sebestyen, the head of the Center for Economic Policy at Mathias Corvinus Collegium, a conservative government-affiliated university, said Mr. Orban was unlikely to send inspectors to punish shopkeepers who hadn’t lowered prices. “Socialism obviously doesn’t work,” he said, “and Eastern Europe knows that better than anyone.”</p><p>But Peter Bod, a former governor of Hungary’s central bank, fears Mr. Orban is reaching for communist-era tools in what is supposed to be a free market.</p><p>“Instead of goulash communism,” he said, referring to the country’s idiosyncratic reworking of Soviet-imposed socialism in the 1960s and ’70s, “we got goulash capitalism.”</p><p>Barnabas Heincz contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
