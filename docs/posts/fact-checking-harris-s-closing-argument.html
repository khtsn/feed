In other posts, he called for the prosecution of former President Barack Obama, former Representative Liz Cheney and the special counsel Jack Smith.</p><p>Additionally, Mr. Trump has specifically referred to Ms. Pelosi and Representative Adam Schiff of California as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-democracy-threats.html" title="">“enemy within.”</a></p><p>Ms. Harris is also correct that Mr. Trump has promised to pardon rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In March, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112079753989223875" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he pledged</a> on social media that one of his first acts as president would be to “free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned.” In <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an April interview</a> with Time magazine, he said he would “absolutely” consider pardoning every person prosecuted for the attack, adding that “if somebody was evil and bad, I would look at that differently.” Asked in July if he would pardon those who attacked police, Mr. Trump again answered “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/trump-jan-6-pardons-nabj.html" title="">absolutely</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>What Was Said</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/us/elections/abortion-cover/abortion-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-harris-issues-election.html#abortion" title="">position on a federal abortion ban</a> is muddled and has shifted several times this campaign alone. And he has not said he would mandate states to monitor women’s pregnancies, but that it is their prerogative to do so.</p><p>In March, <a href="https://wabcradio.com/2024/03/19/332694/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump suggested</a> he would support a federal ban on abortions after 15 week — a cutoff, he said, that “people are agreeing on” — with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.</p><p>Then in April, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/us/politics/trump-arizona-abortion.html" title="">said he would not sign a federal abortion ban</a>. In the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presidential debate</a> in September, Mr. Trump again said he would not sign a ban because “this issue has now been taken over by the states.”</p><p>But when asked about a claim by his running mate, Senator JD Vance, that he would veto such a ban, Mr. Trump said he “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/us/politics/vance-trump-abortion-ban.html" title="">didn’t discuss it</a> with JD.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In October, Mr. Trump then <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-says-he-would-veto-federal-abortion-ban/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he would veto a federal ban.</a></p><p>In April, asked by Time magazine whether states should monitor women’s pregnancies and prosecute violators, Mr. Trump did not say that they should.

Mr. Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security or Medicare, though an independent analysis has found that his overall agenda would harm Social Security’s financial health. And it is unclear where Mr. Trump stands on the $35 monthly cap on insulin for Medicare beneficiaries, given that he started a pilot program that introduced the cap but has also indicated support for repealing the law that expanded that cap.</p><p>While the 2017 tax measure was disproportionately beneficial to the rich and corporations, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/business/economy/income-tax-cut.html" title="">majority of people received a tax cut.</a> The law’s reductions to the individual tax rate are set to expire in 2025, and Mr. Trump supports extending those cuts and further <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/five-questions-about-trumps-made-america-corporate-tax-rate" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reducing the corporate tax rate</a> from 21 percent to 15 percent for some companies. But several of his other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/politics/trump-harris-issues-election.html#economy" title="">tax proposals</a> would benefit middle- and lower-income Americans, including eliminating taxes on tips and Social Security benefits.</p><p>During his 2024 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/us/politics/trump-harris-fact-check-policies-records.html#link-3b6479de" title="">he would not cut Social Security or Medicare</a>, though he had previously shown brief and vague support for such proposals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>It is worth noting, though, that a <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/what-would-trump-campaign-plans-mean-social-security" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Mr. Trump’s policies would “dramatically worsen Social Security’s finances.” Those proposals, the think tank said, would hasten the depletion of Social Security’s trust funds from 2034 to 2031. In contrast, Ms. Harris’s proposals “would not have large effects on Social Security Trust Fund solvency.”</p><p>As for the insulin price cap, Mr. Trump has made no specific proposals to eliminate it.</p><p>In fact, the Trump administration started a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/health/insulin-drug-prices.html" title="">Medicare pilot program in 2020</a> that laid the groundwork for it. Under the voluntary program, insurers could cap the price of insulin at $35 a month for Medicare prescription drug coverage plans, known as Part D, covering an <a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/part-d-savings-model" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated 800,000 enrollees.</a></p><p>The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022, expanded that cap to all Medicare Part D plans, <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/insulin-out-of-pocket-costs-in-medicare-part-d/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">covering 3.3 million enrollees</a>, and also added a $35 cap to co-pays under Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits, lab tests and other medical services.</p><p>Ms. Harris has a point that Mr. Trump has said that he would “terminate” or “end the green new scam,” his derisive term for the Inflation Reduction Act. He has offered few specifics on what this would entail, and whether it would include repealing the expanded cap, and his campaign did not respond when asked. But on some occasions, he and his advisers have indicated that the repeal may be partial, and targeted to rescinding funding intended to combat climate change.</p><p>Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2024/harris-trump-election-issues.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview with the AARP,</a> said he would “continue my efforts to protect Americans from unaffordable drug prices.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He added, “I will keep any drug savings in Medicare, and I will finish what we started in my first term.”</p><p>What Was Said</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-17"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/us/elections/fentanyl-cover/fentanyl-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p><strong>False. </strong>Ms. Harris was referring to the amount of fentanyl seized by border officials, but those numbers are open to interpretation.</p><p>The amount of fentanyl <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seized by border officials</a> has doubled from 11,200 pounds in the 2021 fiscal year to nearly 22,000 pounds in the 2024 fiscal year.</p><p>Ultimately, the amount interdicted at the border is a proportion of all drugs illegally trafficked into the United States, but what proportion those seizures represent is unknowable. A greater amount seized does not necessarily mean a reduction in supply into the country, as Ms. Harris suggests. The data could also be interpreted as a proxy measure for the overall supply.
