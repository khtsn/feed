Gregg, the first African American Army officer to reach the rank of lieutenant general and the only person in modern history to have a military base named for him in his lifetime, died on Aug. 22.

Col. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/22/us/charity-adams-earley-black-pioneer-in-wacs-dies-at-83.html" title="">Charity Adams Earley</a>, who was the highest-ranking Black woman to serve as an Army officer in World War II.</p><p>The new name was <a href="https://cybercemetery.unt.edu/thenamingcommission/20220922214753/https:/www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwebarchive.library.unt.edu%2Fdocs%2FNaming_Commission_Final_Report_Part_I.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw1wbc50gjoHK2x8w0jvXHdC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommended</a> by a congressional commission charged with rechristening nine military bases named for Confederate officers, as part of a national self-examination around race set off by the murder of George Floyd in 2020.</p><p>Fort Lee was named for Robert E. Lee, one of eight Virginians at the outbreak of the Civil War who were West Point graduates and U.S. Army colonels. Among them, the renaming commission noted, only Lee chose to take up arms against the United States. “The main difference” separating Lee from the others “was that Lee and his family enslaved other humans,” the commission’s report stated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Fort Gregg-Adams, about 30 miles south of Richmond, has long been a hub of Army logistics, the field in which General Gregg made his 35-year military career. He commanded a 3,700-soldier logistics battalion in Vietnam, based in Cam Ranh Bay, and rose to be deputy chief of staff for logistics for the Army, overseeing support services around the world.</p><p>He was posted to Fort Lee as a young officer in 1950 to train in logistics. Although President Harry S. Truman had ordered the desegregation of the military two years earlier, the facts on the ground had changed little.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>General Gregg in 2022 at what was then Fort Lee.

Growing up in poverty in the rural South, one of nine children in a home without indoor plumbing or electricity, he had hoped to work as a technician in a medical lab.</p><p>At 17, he completed a training course at the Chicago College of Medical Technology and got a job in a city hospital. But he was told he could not visit the bedsides of white patients.</p><p>He quit and enlisted in the Army in 1946, hoping it would offer a path to a medical tech job. Sent to occupied Germany, he was told there were no jobs for Black soldiers in medical facilities; instead, he was assigned to an all-Black unit of the Quartermaster Corps.</p><p>It was a role he ended up embracing: He advanced to sergeant at 18 and, after completing officer candidate school, became an instructor at the Quartermaster Leadership School at Fort Lee.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>The commission that eventually recommended the renaming of Fort Lee in General Gregg’s honor noted that while Army support services, including the Quartermaster Corps, broadly known as “sustainment,” might not be the military’s most prestigious field, it had an illustrious history dating to the Civil War.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>General Gregg at Fort Gregg-Adams in 2023.

He was the youngest child of Robert and Ethel Gregg, subsistence farmers who grew cotton and tobacco and raised livestock on 100 acres.</p><p>Besides helping on the farm, Arthur walked three miles to a small, rudely built segregated school.</p><p>“The white children had a consolidated, very modern brick school and were provided with bus transportation from their homes,” General Gregg <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/263852/celebrating_the_career_of_retired_lt_gen_arthur_j_gregg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recalled</a> in an interview published on the Army’s website in 2023. “It was a different situation based on race at that time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>His mother died when he was 11, and he went to live with an older brother in Newport News, Va., where he attended Huntington High School.</p><p>He added to his academic credentials once in the Army, earning a degree in business administration from St. Benedict’s College (now part of Benedictine College) in Atchison, Kan., in 1965. He graduated from the Army War College in 1968.</p><p>His wife, Charlene (McDaniel) Gregg, died in 2006, and his daughter Sandra Gregg died in 2009. His survivors include another daughter, Alicia Collier, and three grandchildren.</p><p>General Gregg was awarded his first star in 1972, when he was promoted to brigadier general.
