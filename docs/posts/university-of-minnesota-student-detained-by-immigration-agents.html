University of Minnesota earlier this week, the school said Friday in a statement that called the situation “deeply concerning.”</p><p>The student was taken into custody on Thursday at an off-campus residence, the school’s president, Rebecca Cunningham, <a href="https://president.umn.edu/important-update-graduate-student-detained" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in the statement</a>.</p><p>“The university had no prior knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities before it occurred,” the statement said.</p><p>The university did not identify the student’s name, nationality or visa type. Jake Ricker, a university spokesman, said the student was enrolled in the Carlson School of Management.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for information about the case.</p><p>The arrest follows other incidents in which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/students-trump-ice-detention.html" title="">ICE targeted international students or scholars at American universities</a>. Three involved students at Columbia University.
