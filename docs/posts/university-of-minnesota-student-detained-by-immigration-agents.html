University of Minnesota earlier this week, the school said Friday in a statement that called the situation “deeply concerning.”</p><p>The student was taken into custody on Thursday at an off-campus residence, the school’s president, Rebecca Cunningham, <a href="https://president.umn.edu/important-update-graduate-student-detained" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in the
