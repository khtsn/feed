The attack on Wadee and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, was “brutal and heinous<strong>,” </strong>Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak said as she announced the sentence of the man, Joseph M. Czuba, on murder and hate crime charges.</p><p>The authorities quickly arrested and charged Mr. Czuba after the attack. Prosecutors said Mr. Czuba, 73, had rented rooms to Wadee’s mother in Plainfield Township, Ill., for two years with no significant problems. But, they said, he had grown paranoid and violent after listening to radio coverage of the unfolding conflict in the Middle East.</p><p>In court on Friday in Joliet, Ill., Mahmoud Yousef, an uncle of Wadee’s father, said no sentence would be satisfying to the family.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Yousef said that the family could not fathom what led to such an act. “That’s more than just hate, that went way beyond that,” Mr. Yousef said. “We’re talking about a 6-year-old kid whose father had plans for him.”</p><p>He asked Mr. Czuba to explain himself. </p><p>“For peace of mind, Joseph, say something,” Mr. Yousef said as he looked directly at Mr. Czuba.</p><p>Wearing a red jail jumpsuit, Mr. Czuba declined to speak at the hearing. His lawyer argued before the sentence was handed down that he had not received a fair trial.</p><p>The attack left many members of Illinois’s large Palestinian American and Muslim communities frightened and angry. Some leaders connected the attack to rhetoric used by some American politicians and media personalities that they said dehumanized Palestinians.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wadee Alfayoumi and his mother were targeted for the Muslim faith.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/palestinian-boy-stabbing-trial-czuba-al-fayoume.html" title="">Ms. Shaheen testified</a> during Mr. Czuba’s trial in February that he had started speaking hatefully about Muslims and asked her to move out of the home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I told him, ‘Pray for peace,’” said Ms. Shaheen, who is Muslim and Palestinian American. She did not appear to be in court on Friday.</p><p>A few days after that first tense conversation, Ms. Shaheen told jurors, Mr. Czuba forced his way into her room and began stabbing her with a knife, leaving her bleeding from the chest, back and head. After she retreated into a bathroom to call 911, she said Mr. Czuba fatally attacked Wadee, who had just celebrated his sixth birthday.</p><p>The boy, she said, cried out, “Stop, oh no.”</p><p>During the trial, prosecutors told jurors that the killing had been motivated by fear and hate.</p><p>“This happened because this defendant was afraid that a war that started on Oct. 7, 2023 — a half a world away in the Middle East — was going to come to his doorstep,” Michael Fitzgerald, a prosecutor, told jurors. “This happened because Hanan and Wadee were Muslim.”</p><p>The jury deliberated for about an hour before convicting Mr. Czuba on murder and hate crime charges.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mitch Smith is a Chicago-based national correspondent for The Times, covering the Midwest and Great Plains.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
