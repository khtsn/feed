Only a small portion of the gathering, which was scheduled to last four hours, was broadcast to the public. But it offered a vivid illustration of Mr. Trump’s recent embrace of crypto, a renegade industry that has spent years battling with U.S. regulators.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Several executives, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, offered words of gratitude to Mr. Trump. They called him “wonderful,” saying they were “overjoyed” with his approach.</p><p>“High I.Q. individuals around this table,” Mr. Trump responded.</p><p>Since he took office, Mr. Trump has orchestrated a complete transformation of federal policy on crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission has almost entirely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/technology/crypto-sec-trump.html" title="">reversed an aggressive campaign by the Biden administration</a> to crack down on the industry. The agency, moving with astonishing speed, has issued legal guidance to help crypto companies, ended investigations into major firms and dropped lawsuits against two of the largest exchanges, Coinbase and Kraken.</p><p>Leaders of both those companies attended the White House event on Friday. Brian Armstrong, the Coinbase chief executive, sat two seats away from the president.</p><p>“It signals the industry is finally a serious industry,” said JP Richardson, who runs the crypto firm Exodus and flew to Washington to participate in Mr. Trump’s summit. “We believe the technology can fundamentally change the world. And to actually have this administration take it seriously is really important.”</p><p>The meeting was also a reminder of Mr. Trump’s personal investment in crypto, which ethics experts have described as an alarming conflict of interest. The guest list included <a href="https://x.com/ZachWitkoff/status/1897021137173012797" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zach Witkoff</a>, the son of Steve Witkoff, a close friend of the president’s who serves as the administration’s special envoy to the Middle East. The younger Mr. Witkoff is a founder of World Liberty Financial, a crypto business that Mr. Trump heavily promoted last year — and from which he and his family profit directly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Once a crypto skeptic, Mr. Trump embraced digital currencies on the campaign trail last year, as crypto firms spent tens of millions of dollars to back him as well as congressional candidates who supported the technology.</p><p>Soon, Mr. Trump entered the market himself. Last fall, he and his sons worked with the Witkoffs to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/technology/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html" title="">start World Liberty Financial</a>, promoting it as a platform for borrowing and lending in crypto. World Liberty has its own digital currency, WLFI, and the Trump family receives a cut of the sales.</p><p>Just days before his inauguration, Mr. Trump also started selling a so-called memecoin, a type of cryptocurrency tied to an internet joke or a celebrity mascot. The coin, called $Trump, briefly surged and then crashed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html" title="">costing</a> investors a cumulative $2 billion.</p><p>Since winning the election, Mr. Trump has taken steps to boost the industry’s prospects, appointing crypto supporters to top administration posts and calling for federal agencies to develop a new approach to regulation.</p><p>On Thursday night, he signed an executive order to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/technology/trump-crypto-reserve-executive-order.html" title="">create a national reserve of Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto executives pitched the plan as a strategy to chip away at the national debt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Skeptics have attacked the proposal as a scheme to enrich a small number of crypto investors. Even some of Mr. Trump’s supporters in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/dealbook/trump-crypto-bitcoin-reserve.html#:~:text=Critics%20of%20all,crypto%20bro%20schemes.%E2%80%9D" title="">technology</a> world have joined in the criticism.</p><p>After Mr. Trump teased the reserve announcement on social media last weekend, Joe Lonsdale, a prominent tech investor, <a href="https://x.com/jtlonsdale/status/1896245689488920748" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X that the government shouldn’t waste money on “crypto bro schemes.”</p><p>None of that dissent was on display at the summit. The meeting was cordial, said Sergey Nazarov, a founder of the crypto company Chainlink, who attended the event. One by one, the executives shared their views on crypto policy, with little time for debate or disagreement.</p><p>“This wasn’t a meeting where things were being decided or disclosed,” Mr. Nazarov said. “This was more of a collaborative brainstorming type of session.”</p><p>In the public portion of the summit, Mr. Trump sat between David Sacks, the White House’s crypto policy czar, and Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump hailed the event as a turning point in the nation’s treatment of the crypto industry.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” he said. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.”</p><p>He said the new national Bitcoin stockpile would create a virtual Fort Knox for the nation’s holdings. “Never sell your Bitcoin,” Mr. Trump said.</p><p>In his own remarks, Mr. Sacks praised Mr. Trump’s leadership, saying the administration was “moving at tech speed.” The industry had been subject to “prosecution and persecution” under the Biden administration, he said.</p><p>“Nobody knows what that feels like better than you do,” Mr. Sacks said to the president.</p><p>Then he turned to the Winklevoss twins, sitting on the other side of the room.</p><p>“You said something earlier that I thought was really profound,” Mr. Sacks told them. “A year ago, you thought that it would be more likely that you’d end up in jail than at the White House.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
