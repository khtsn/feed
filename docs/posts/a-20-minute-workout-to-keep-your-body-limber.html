And while the most <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/low-back-pain" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">common place to feel</a> pain is the lower back, that pain can be caused by a lack of mobility in the upper spine.</p><p>Your upper, or thoracic, spine absorbs stress and distributes it to your other muscles and joints. Yet there are few opportunities to engage the spine’s full range of motion during daily life, which can cause problems. Sitting all day makes it worse, and walking or jogging do not challenge it enough.</p><p>“We’ve trained our brains and nerves to think midrange is the limit,” said Gene Shirokobrod, a physical therapist in Maryland. Sudden movements beyond that range, swinging an ax or a golf club, say, can cause spasms and pain as other parts of the body try to compensate.</p><p>A consistent exercise routine that extends the spine’s range of motion, especially twisting, can help prevent injuries from sudden movements. Whether you are hoping to avoid golf injuries or just want to be able to reach your kid’s car seat, try this workout to increase your range of rotational movement in your upper spine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-14f678c8">Overview</h2><p><strong>Time:</strong> 20 to 30 minutes</p><p><strong>Intensity:</strong> Low</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-46bf02ba">What you’ll need</h2><ul><li><p>A lightweight dumbbell or kettlebell</p></li><li><p>A chair or short stool</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-3ecf4e02">How often</h2><p>Doing this workout once should help you tune into your upper spine’s range of motion. If your goal is to significantly increase it, though, you will have to repeat these exercises often. A good program would be three to four times a week for six to eight weeks. Once you’re feeling improvements, switch to once per week.</p><h2 id="link-69df8e06">Adjust for you</h2><p>If you can’t manage the weights, start the routine without them.

Bending your elbows back and over your shoulders, place your palms (or fingertips, if you can’t reach) on your back. Holding this position, push your elbows into the seat and drive your chest toward the ground until you feel your natural stopping point. Hold for a count of five to 10 seconds, then release your hold.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-12a73931">Open books</h2><p><strong>Repetitions:</strong> Three sets, eight to 10 times per side</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/well/move/SPINE-ROTATION-02/SPINE-ROTATION-02-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/well/move/SPINE-ROTATION-02/SPINE-ROTATION-02-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/23/128476_1_SPINE-ROTATION-02_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>This is a two-part move: the first part loosens you up and the second challenges the mobility of your upper spine. Lie down on one side with your knees stacked and your bottom arm outstretched on the floor. Your top hip should be pointing up, and it should remain in this position throughout the movement. Wrap your top arm down around your ribs and tuck your elbow into your side. Rotate your torso as you hold on and pull on your rib cage.</p><p>When you’re ready, stack your top arm on top of the bottom one, then rotate it up and back toward the ground behind you. Your goal is to get your top arm and shoulder to touch the ground. If you can’t make it, go as far as you can without moving your hips. Hold that position for a few breaths and try to push farther into it.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-70b83442">Rotational high pull</h2><p><strong>Repetitions:</strong> Three sets, eight to 10 times per side</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-16"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/well/move/SPINE-ROTATION-03/SPINE-ROTATION-03-square640.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/well/move/SPINE-ROTATION-03/SPINE-ROTATION-03-square640.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/23/128477_1_SPINE-ROTATION-03_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Start in a deadlift/hinge position, leaning over in front of you with your knees slightly bent and your back straight.

Without bending your elbows, lift your head while allowing your lower back to sag down. Return to neutral, then lower your head while rounding your lower back. Keep the movement slow and controlled for 30 to 60 seconds.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-1a02802d">Where to go from here</h2><p>Exercises like these will help extend your range of motion, but within limits. The goal is to regain mobility you once had, and continually pushing yourself harder is unlikely to help past a certain point.</p><p>Also, you need to keep them up to maintain mobility over time. You should see small improvements after a few weeks and best results after six to eight. If you feel looser and notice that you can access wider twisting ranges — swinging that golf club farther back, for instance — aim to maintain it with one weekly session going forward.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><p>Amanda Loudin is a freelance writer covering health and science.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
