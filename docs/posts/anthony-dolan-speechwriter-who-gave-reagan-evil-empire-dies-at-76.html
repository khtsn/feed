Dolan, who as Ronald Reagan’s chief speechwriter deployed the phrase “evil empire” in 1983 to describe the Soviet Union and in another address consigned Marxism and Leninism to “the ash heap of history,” died on March 11 in Alexandria, Va. He was 76.</p><p>His death, in a hospital, was announced by Fred Ryan, the board chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation &amp; Institute, who said, “Tony’s ability to distill complex ideas into powerful, memorable speeches helped define the Reagan presidency and shaped the course of the Cold War.”</p><p>The cause was not specified.</p><p>Mr. Dolan was one of the youngest winners of a Pulitzer Prize in journalism. As a reporter for The Advocate in Stamford, Conn., he was 29 when he was awarded the prize in 1978 for local investigative specialized reporting, for a series of exposés of corruption in that city’s municipal government and organized crime’s infiltration of its police department.</p><p>After serving for eight years as a speechwriter in the Reagan White House, he was a special adviser to Defense Secretary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/us/politics/donald-rumsfeld-dead.html" title="">Donald H. Rumsfeld</a> and a senior adviser to Secretary of State <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/us/politics/colin-powell-dead.html" title="">Colin Powell</a> during the administration of President George W. Bush. He was a White House special assistant during Donald J. Trump’s first term, and in January was recruited as a special assistant by the president’s Domestic Policy Council.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Dolan began his political career as a teenage volunteer in Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign. He went on to take jobs in three Republican administrations and was for a time a singer and lyricist of conservative folk songs. (His “The New York Times Blues” parodies the paper as containing “all the news that’s fit to print, unless, of course, its anti-communist.”)</p><p>In the White House, he was a dogged defender of President Reagan’s blunt war of words against what Mr. Dolan saw as the ungodly Soviets. He resisted pressure from presidential advisers who, subscribing to realpolitik, wanted him to tone down his verbal assaults — including his hope that “the march of freedom and democracy” would “leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history.”</p><p>“Evil empire” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/09/world/president-urges-global-crusade-for-democracy-text-of-reagan-s-address-page-a16.html" title="">ash heap,</a>” both derived from earlier iterations (“Star Wars” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/magazine/on-language-dust-heaps-of-history.html" title="">Leon Trotsky</a> among them) survived into final drafts thanks to Mr. Dolan. He also oversaw the speech his assistant, <a href="https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/summer/berlin.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peter Robinson</a>, wrote in which Mr. Reagan, at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in 1987, challenged the Soviet leader: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/13/world/raze-berlin-wall-reagan-urges-soviet.html" title="">“Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”</a></p><p>In a video tribute to Mr. Dolan, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZt-fcS3pd0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Robinson recalled</a> a tug of war between “the true believers vs. the pragmatists — and the true believers were the speechwriters and Ronald Reagan.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Several mentions of “evil” were deleted from drafts of the “ash heap” speech that Mr. Dolan wrote for delivery to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm35tFTtsuc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">British Parliament in 1982</a>. But he persisted in using the word, and he triumphed the following year when, in March, Mr. Reagan addressed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7bUye1CpfE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Association of Evangelicals</a>, who were divided between antiwar Quakers and anti-communist conservatives.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Dolan and Mr. Reagan in October 1988 on Air Force One. “The leader of the free world had spoken the truth,” a Soviet dissident said of the “evil empire” speech Mr. Dolan wrote.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Dolan family</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Reagan urged his audience to “beware the temptation of pride, the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all,” which<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/reagan-denounces-ideology-of-soviet-as-focus-of-evil.html" title="">,</a> he warned, would be “to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire.”</p><p>“With some nifty footwork, Dolan finally managed to get Reagan to deliver the speech he wanted,” Simon Lancaster, a British speechwriter, recalled in “You Are Not Human: How Words Kill” (2018), “deploying that age-old speechwriter tactic of circulating the draft at the very last minute, so no one has any time to comment.”</p><p>Natan Sharansky, who was imprisoned at the time, later wrote that he and fellow Soviet dissidents were ecstatic. “Finally,” he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2000/10/12/afraid-of-the-truth/2b451b6f-e44a-4486-b6e9-7f22db6cd01e/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in The Washington Post in 2000</a>, “the leader of the free world had spoken the truth — a truth that burned inside the heart of each and every one of us.”</p><p>David Gergen, who was Mr. Reagan’s communications director, wrote in his book “Eyewitness to Power”: “I hate to admit it, but it’s true: History has shown that Tony Dolan was right and I was wrong. That phrase, the evil empire, allowed Reagan to speak truth to totalitarianism.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And Vince Haley, the director of Mr. Trump’s Domestic Policy Council, and several other speechwriters wrote in <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2025/03/17/keeper_of_the_flame_rest_in_peace_anthony_r_dolan_152516.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Clear Politics</a> this week, “Dolan channeled Reagan’s moral and intellectual arguments that framed the U.S.S.R. not simply as a competitor but as an aggressive force of evil in the world.”</p><p>Anthony Rossi Dolan was born on July 7, 1948, in Norwalk, Conn., to Joseph and Margaret (Kelley) Dolan. His father was a store manager.</p><p>Mr. Dolan was a Roman Catholic who attended Mass daily and a fierce anti-communist. In a eulogy for his sister, <a href="https://www.moneyandking.com/obits/mary-dolan-maiselle-shortley/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maiselle Shortley</a>, last year, he told a story from when he was 6 years old:</p><p>“My mother took a course on communism downtown at St Mary’s Church from Louis Budenz, former Soviet operative and editor of The Daily Worker, who had become a Catholic and Fordham professor. She took Budenz’s talks to heart about communism’s global menace. ‘I used to wonder if you kids would even have a country to grow up in,’ she would say.”</p><p>Mr. Dolan kept a book that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/28/archives/louis-budenz-mccarthy-witness-dies.html" title="">Mr. Budenz</a> had inscribed to his mother.</p><p>Mr. Haley said in an interview, “Tony didn’t just condemn communism in the speeches he helped craft; he rallied souls to a positive conception of freedom of God with man.”</p><p>After graduating from Fairfield College Preparatory School in Connecticut, where he was class president, Mr. Dolan majored in philosophy and history at Yale University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1970. He served in the U.S. Army as a specialist 4.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Mr. Dolan was the deputy press secretary in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/nyregion/james-buckley-dead.html" title="">James L.
