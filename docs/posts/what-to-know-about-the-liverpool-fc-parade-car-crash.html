Investigators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/europe/uk-liverpool-parade-police-suspect.html" title="">moved quickly to announce</a> that the driver of the car was a 53-year-old white man from Britain, in an effort to stop the spread of misinformation.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000010191264/liverpool-parade-car-plowing.html" title="">collision ripped through</a> what should have been a jubilant day for the city. Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered on Monday, a public holiday, to celebrate Liverpool F.C.’s title in the Premier League, which is the top tier of English soccer.</p><p>“Scenes of joy turned to utter horror and devastation,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn5xnlkegz0t?post=asset%3Aeffcc467-9ea4-48da-a6e5-fd2ebf382f87#post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told broadcast</a> journalists on Tuesday, adding, “The whole country stands with Liverpool.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-3fee16dc">What happened?</h2><p>The <a href="https://x.com/MerseyPolice/status/1927060788516127150" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Merseyside Police said</a> they were contacted at about 6 p.m. on Monday local time after reports that a car had hit crowds gathered for Liverpool F.C.’s victory parade.</p><p>The ramming happened along Water Street in the city center, near the end of the 10-mile parade route.</p><p>At a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said the route and surrounding roads had been shut as part of a “robust traffic management plan” for the event.</p><p>Water Street was among the roads closed to traffic. But she said that the driver of car — a dark gray Ford Galaxy minivan — is believed to have followed an ambulance that was allowed into the area to help someone with a possible heart attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Sims said the incident, which followed several vehicle attacks in Europe in recent years, was not being treated as terrorism. “An extensive investigation into the precise circumstances of the incident is ongoing, and we continue to ask people not to speculate,” she added.</p><p>Videos shared on social media showed the Ford Galaxy speeding up and slowing down at least twice during the incident as it drove through the crowd. Footage of the moments before the car came to a standstill showed it swerving and hitting pedestrians, leaving injured people on the ground. People rushed to help the victims, some of whom had been trapped beneath the vehicle, and surrounded the vehicle once it stopped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some people attempted to stop the vehicle, videos showed, with one person prying open the driver’s-side door before a man in the seat slammed the door shut and accelerated into the crowd.</p><h2 id="link-4df57769">Who is the suspect?</h2><p>The police described the suspected driver as a “53-year-old white British man” from Liverpool.</p><p>Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said Tuesday at a news conference that the man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs, adding: “He remains in custody, where he is being interviewed.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Merseyside Police, who have not identified the suspect — in line with normal British protocol before charges are brought — did not disclose what substance he may have taken.</p><p>The police first released information about the suspect less than two hours after the crash, as posts on social media were already erupting with alternative theories about what might have happened, and why.</p><p>The decision to quickly disclose the driver’s race and nationality appeared calculated to prevent misinformation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/europe/uk-liverpool-parade-police-suspect.html" title="">Rumors</a> have spread after other recent violent episodes in Britain.</p><p>Last summer, after a British-born man with parents from Rwanda fatally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/europe/southport-stabbing-uk-suspect.html" title="">stabbed three young girls</a> at a dance studio in Southport, a town north of Liverpool, false reports that the assailant was an undocumented Muslim migrant spread rapidly online. The next day, a riot broke out in Southport, the first of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/world/europe/southport-stabbing-uk-riots.html" title="">several in cities and towns across England</a>.</p><h2 id="link-76427d61">Who was injured?</h2><p>Sixty-five people were injured in the crash, including 50 who required hospital treatment, the police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The local ambulance service previously said that four children were among the victims, including one who was seriously injured.</p><p>As of Tuesday afternoon, 11 people remained in the hospital, Ms. Sims said, adding: “They are all in a stable condition, and I am pleased to say that they appear to be recovering well.”</p><p>Four people were temporarily trapped under the car, including one child, the fire and rescue service said.</p><p>Officials have not yet identified any of the victims.</p><h2 id="link-64f1d2d2">What have officials said?</h2><p>King Charles, who is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/canada/king-charles-canada-visit-trump.html" title="">visiting Canada</a>, said in a statement on Tuesday that he and Queen Camilla were “deeply shocked and saddened” to hear of the events in Liverpool.</p><p>“It is truly devastating to see that what should have been a joyous celebration for so many could end in such distressing circumstances,” he wrote. “At this heartbreaking time for the people of Liverpool, I know that the strength of community spirit for which your city is renowned will be a comfort and support to those in need.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Starmer said: “Liverpool stands together — and the whole country stands with Liverpool,” as he thanked emergency medical workers.</p><p>Liam Robinson, a member of the Liverpool City Council, <a href="https://liverpoolexpress.co.uk/statement-from-council-leader-following-incident-in-liverpool-city-centre/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement that the episode had “cast a very dark shadow on what’s been a joyous day for the city.”</p><p>Billy Hogan, the chief executive of Liverpool F.C., issued a message to club supporters offering support to all those affected by the “appalling incident.”</p><p>“This weekend was one of celebration, emotion and joy spread across the city in our entire fan base, and it ended in unimaginable scenes of distress,” he added.</p><p>Mark Landler<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chloe W.
