The police <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/europe/uk-liverpool-parade-police-suspect.html" title="">moved quickly to announce</a> that the driver of the car, who they arrested, was a 53-year-old white man from Britain, in an apparent move to stop the spread of misinformation.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000010191264/liverpool-parade-car-plowing.html" title="">collision ripped through</a> what should have been a jubilant day for the city. Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered on Monday, a public holiday, to celebrate Liverpool F.C.’s victory in the Premier League, which is the top tier of British soccer.</p><p>“Scenes of joy turned to utter horror and devastation,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn5xnlkegz0t?post=asset%3Aeffcc467-9ea4-48da-a6e5-fd2ebf382f87#post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told broadcast</a> journalists on Tuesday, adding, “The whole country stands with Liverpool.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-3fee16dc">What happened?</h2><p>The <a href="https://x.com/MerseyPolice/status/1927060788516127150" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Merseyside Police said</a> they were contacted at about 6 p.m. on Monday local time after reports that a car had hit the crowd.</p><p>Video shared on social media shows a dark-color vehicle with a broken rear window swerving into the crowd and hitting parade-goers, leaving bodies on the ground. The video shows people rushing to aid the victims, including some who were trapped beneath the vehicle, and surrounding the vehicle once it stopped.</p><p>The ramming happened along Water Street in the Liverpool city center, near the end of the 10-mile parade route.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Video also shows witnesses attempting to stop the vehicle, with one person prying open the driver’s-side door before a man in the seat slams the door shut and accelerates into the crowd.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At a news conference on Monday, Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims of the Merseyside Police said: “What I can tell you is that we believe this to be an isolated incident and we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with it. The incident is not being treated as terrorism.”</p><h2 id="link-4df57769">Who is the suspect?</h2><p>The police said that the car stopped at the scene and that a “53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area” had been arrested.</p><p>“We believe him to be the driver of the vehicle,” Ms. Sims confirmed at the news conference.</p><p>The police, who have not identified the man, released information about the suspect less than two hours after the episode occurred, as posts on social media were already erupting with alternative theories about what might have happened, and why.</p><p>The decision to disclose the driver’s race and nationality so quickly appeared calculated to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/europe/uk-liverpool-parade-police-suspect.html" title="">defuse the rumors and misinformation</a> that have spread after other recent violent episodes in Britain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last summer, after a British-born man with parents from Rwanda fatally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/world/europe/southport-stabbing-uk-suspect.html" title="">stabbed three young girls</a> at a dance studio in Southport, a town north of Liverpool, false reports that the assailant was an undocumented Muslim migrant spread rapidly online. The next day, a riot broke out in Southport, the first of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/world/europe/southport-stabbing-uk-riots.html" title="">several in cities and towns across England</a>.</p><h2 id="link-76427d61">Who was injured?</h2><p>Forty-seven people were injured in the crash, including four children, the ambulance service said on Monday night.</p><p>Twenty-seven of them were taken to hospitals, two of whom — including one child — had sustained serious injuries, the authorities said on Monday.</p><p>Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool City Region, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002cn8w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the BBC</a> on Tuesday morning that four people in the hospital were still “very, very ill.”</p><p>“We are hoping, of course, that they pull through,” he said.</p><p>Twenty others were treated at the scene with minor injuries. A paramedic on a cycle was also struck by the vehicle, but did not sustain any serious injuries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Four people were temporarily trapped under the vehicle, including one child, the fire and rescue service said.</p><p>Officials have not yet identified any of the victims.</p><h2 id="link-64f1d2d2">What have officials said?</h2><p>King Charles, who is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/world/canada/king-charles-canada-visit-trump.html" title="">visiting Canada</a>, said in a statement on Tuesday that he was “deeply shocked and saddened” to hear of the events in Liverpool.</p><p>“It is truly devastating to see that what should have been a joyous celebration for so many could end in such distressing circumstances,” he wrote. “At this heartbreaking time for the people of Liverpool, I know that the strength of community spirit for which your city is renowned will be a comfort and support to those in need.”</p><p>Mr. Starmer said: “Liverpool stands together — and the whole country stands with Liverpool,” as he thanked emergency medical workers and sent well wishes to the people who had been injured in the incident.</p><p>Liam Robinson, a member of the Liverpool City Council, <a href="https://liverpoolexpress.co.uk/statement-from-council-leader-following-incident-in-liverpool-city-centre/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement that the episode had “cast a very dark shadow on what’s been a joyous day for the city.”</p><p>Liverpool F.C. wrote on X that it was in direct contact with the police. “We will continue to offer our full support to the emergency services and local authorities who are dealing with this incident,” it said.</p><p>Mark Landler<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Chloe W.
