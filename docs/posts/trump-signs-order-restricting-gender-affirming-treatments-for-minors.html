It also gave the department 90 days to release a new set of best practices, meant to revise <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/magazine/gender-therapy.html" title="">guidance</a> from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which was written to set standards for transgender medical care, and which the order called “junk science.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It tasked agencies providing federal research or education grants to medical institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, with ensuring that those institutions were not carrying out any gender-related procedures.</p><p>And it directed the Federal Employees Health Benefits and Postal Service Health Benefits programs to exclude similar types of coverage starting in 2026.</p><p>Civil rights groups have issued increasingly dire statements criticizing the administration for a stance they say widely demonizes and marginalizes transgender people.</p><p>“Access to gender-affirming care enables trans youth to live authentically and is often life-saving,” Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women’s Law Center, said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s continued assault on the rights and dignity of trans people is deplorable.”</p><p>Demand for gender-affirming medications and hormone therapy among transgender youth has not been studied extensively, but only a small fraction of minors who identify as transgender currently receive gender-transition treatments, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/04/us/supreme-court-transgender-care/bans-on-medical-care-affect-thousands-of-young-trans-people-one-estimate-says?" title="">according to researchers</a> at the Williams Institute at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, which conducts demographic studies about the L.G.B.T.Q. population.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The language from the White House surrounding gender-affirming medical treatments and their effects on the body has grown increasingly severe and disdainful since Mr. Trump took office.</p><p>On his first day, Mr. Trump signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an order</a> describing transgender identity as an “ideology” from which women required institutional protection and restricted single-sex spaces.</p><p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The order</a> directing the Pentagon to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-military-transgender-dei-orders.html" title="">evaluate whether transgender troops could serve in the military</a> cast aspersions on the mental and physical health of anyone who has experienced gender dysphoria or has had a gender-related medical procedure. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-transgender-troops.html" title="">civil rights groups filed a lawsuit</a> in federal court challenging any ban on transgender service members as unconstitutional.</p><p>The order on care for minors, which referred to procedures as “chemical and surgical mutilation,” predicted that “countless children” who received gender-affirming procedures would soon regret the “horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding.”</p><p>Gender-affirming surgeries on minors are exceedingly rare in the United States, a <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/gender-affirming-surgeries-rarely-performed-on-transgender-youth/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard Chan School of Public Health Study found</a> last year. The study’s lead author, Dannie Dai, said legislation banning gender-affirming care among youth “is not about protecting children, but is rooted in bias and stigma” and “seeks to address a perceived problem that does not actually exist.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>More than two-dozen states have passed some form of restriction on gender-affirming medical procedures, according to <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/attacks-on-gender-affirming-care-by-state-map#:~:text=39.4%25%20of%20transgender%20youth%20live,public%20sector%2C%20or%20are%20incarcerated." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> compiled by the Human Rights Campaign. And many states already have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/republicans-state-limits-transgender-identity.html" title="">laws on their books</a> prohibiting public funds from covering gender-transition treatments for state employees and Medicaid recipients.</p><p>While Mr. Trump campaigned on promises to do away with some programs supporting transgender people, he tended to home in on specific cases, such as U.S. prisons offering gender-affirming care to prisoners — something many prisons did, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/politics/trump-prisons-transgender-care-harris.html" title="">as required by federal law</a>, during Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>But in excluding transgender people from certain jobs and facilities, and officially recognizing only two genders — male and female — the Trump administration has gone much further in recent days by essentially placing the federal government in opposition to a wide variety of gender-related therapies and to anyone who seeks them. And it has justified those moves with progressively dark — and factually disputed — descriptions of what those procedures entail.</p><p>Amy Harmon<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The First 100 Days of the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Military Changes:</strong> President Trump moved toward pushing openly transgender people out of the military and directed the Pentagon to end diversity programs as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-military-transgender-dei-orders.html">sought to reshape America’s armed forces</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Firing Prosecutors:</strong> The acting attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/justice-department-firings-trump-jack-smith.html">fired more than a dozen prosecutors</a> who worked on the investigations into Trump for the special counsel Jack Smith, saying they could not be trusted to “faithfully implement” the president’s agenda.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> When Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, refused military planes carrying deportees, infuriating Trump, he revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/americas/colombia-trump-deportation-flights-migrants.html">how heated the question of deportations has become</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health:</strong> Conservative Christian moms believe in home-schooling and distrust food and drug companies.
