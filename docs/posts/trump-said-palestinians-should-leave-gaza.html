Trump suggested that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-israel-gaza.html" title="">Jordan and Egypt should take in the Palestinians</a>.</p><p>“I don’t know how they could want to stay,” the president said. “It’s a demolition site. It’s a pure demolition site.”</p><p>Trump tried to frame the matter as a humanitarian imperative. But neither Egypt nor Jordan wants large numbers of Palestinians, nor is it clear that Gazans would willingly abandon the enclave they have spent years defending.</p><p>The president suggested the U.S. could help Palestinians “find the right piece of land” and “build them some really nice places.” He said he envisions it being a permanent relocation: “I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza,” Trump said. “Gaza is not a place for people to be living.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Trump made the comments shortly before a White House meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — the president’s first in-person meeting with another world leader since returning to power two weeks ago. The two leaders were expected to talk about the next stage of a cease-fire in the Gaza war, Iran’s efforts to build a nuclear weapon and hopes for a deal to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Trump and Netanyahu are set to hold a joint news conference. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/04/us/trump-administration-rfk-jr-gabbard" title="">Follow for updates</a>.</p><p><strong>In the West Bank, </strong>two Israeli soldiers were killed in a shooting attack as Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-raid.html" title="">pressed ahead with a military operation there</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yangshan Port in Shanghai.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Trade experts suggested that China’s response was carefully calibrated to do little short-term damage while hinting at the full range of actions it could take against the U.S. should the trade dispute intensify. China’s tariffs will not take effect until Feb. 10, leaving a week for the two sides to strike a deal — similar to what Canada and Mexico achieved yesterday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/canada/mexico-canada-trump-tariff-deals.html" title="">through different routes</a>.</p><p>The White House said again today that a call between Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, was being scheduled. The president has suggested that he is using the tariffs as leverage to provoke China to do more in the fight against fentanyl.</p><h2 id="link-45b6d1ea">In other politics news:</h2><ul><li><p>A Senate panel approved one of Trump’s most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-confirmation-senate.html" title="">contentious nominees, Tulsi Gabbard</a>, as his director of national intelligence, setting up a full Senate vote.</p></li><li><p>Earlier in the day, a separate Senate committee voted along party lines to advance the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/rfk-jr-senate-vote-finance-committee.html" title="">nomination of Robert F.

What’s next?</h2><p>After winning all five of the Grammy Awards it was nominated for, Kendrick Lamar’s single “Not Like Us” could be the centerpiece of this weekend’s Super Bowl halftime show. That would be a career-defining moment for any artist. But for Lamar, it presents a choice.</p><p>His high-minded lyrics made him a Pulitzer winner and a revered M.C. But “Not Like Us,” a diss track accusing the rapper Drake of serious allegations, could become the signature track of Lamar’s career. He could cement that at the Super Bowl — or, as a fellow rapper told my colleague Joe Coscarelli, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-not-like-us.html" title="">decide that ignoring Drake would be the bigger diss</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-685cd888">25 years ago, The Sims turned players into gods</h2><p>Video game executives did not expect The Sims to be a hit when it was released on this day in 2000.
