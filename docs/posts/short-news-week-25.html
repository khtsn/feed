<p>Most thought that today would be the end of the line for the miraculous Wolves run, as Gen.G had emerged as the tournament favorites following the first round of playoffs. They swept through the Swiss stage with ease, and with the likes of <span data-ref-id="2">

<p>On the other hand, Wolves came into the tournament as one of the lowest rated teams. They themselves hardly expected to win even one match. However, after getting acclimated to the international stage, they have been on a tear. With their fourth consecutive 2-0 victory today, Wolves are now on an eight map win streak.</p>

<p>On Split, Gen.G continued to be the sole representative of the nerfed Tejo, using the same composition they used against <span data-ref-id="3">

</span>. While they let <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498624/fnatic-vs-gen-g-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubqf/?game=221157&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">that map</a> slip away from them, they seemed unfazed, as they took a dominant start to the map. The score quickly became 6-0 in Gen.G&#39;s favor, and by round seven, both of Wolves&#39; timeouts were already expended. <span data-ref-id="4">

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/11600/foxy9">

</span>&#39;s anchoring on Deadlock let Gen.G rack up a 9-3 lead on their defense half.</p>


<p><em>Foxy9 makes it look easy with this spraydown.</em></p>

<p>However, Gen.G were not out of the woods yet. Echoing their loss to FNATIC, they struggled to close out their lead. Wolves began clawing back into the map, finally getting some momentum with a pistol round win. Still, Gen.G were able to push their lead up to 11-6. From there though, Wolves truly came alive. Their site anchors were consistently shutting down Gen.G&#39;s attack, constantly leaving them with nothing to do but bunker down and save their weapons. <span data-ref-id="6">

</span> in particular was a force to be reckoned with on site, racking up five double kills in the second half. For seven rounds in a row, Wolves were untouchable, stealing away Split in a 13-11 victory.</p>

<p>The second map of Sunset was almost a carbon copy of the first. Wolves once again got off to a slow start, letting Gen.G build up a mighty lead. t3xture was feasting on Neon, getting Gen.G up to an 8-4 lead at the half.</p>


<p><em>Mr. 4k adds another one to his portfolio.</em></p>

<p>Once Wolves were on their attack side, however, it was their time to pounce. Save for their second round anti-eco that went awry, they were completely dominant on the second half. The Wolves IGL <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/7849/siufatbb">
		SiuFatBB	</a>
</span> was infallible, finding a way to clutch out every situation he was put in.</p>


<p><em>The SEN Classic is all SiuFatBB needs to clutch the round.</em></p>

<p>Gen.G had no answers to Wolves&#39; momentum, as the wolf pack steamrolled eight rounds in a row to a 13-9 victory.</p>


<p><em>The man can do no wrong.</em></p>

<p>While not as flashy and boisterous as SiuFatBB, <span data-ref-id="8">

</span>&#39;s impact cannot be understated. He was the highest rated player of the match with a 1.33 rating, and has been a consistent rock for the team throughout Wolves&#39; entire run through Toronto. He currently sits as a top five rated player in the tournament.</p>

<p>With their win, Wolves moves on to the upper bracket final to face the winner of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/498625/sentinels-vs-paper-rex-valorant-masters-toronto-2025-ubsf" target="_blank">Sentinels vs. Paper Rex</a>. Gen.G falls down to the lower bracket, where they will have to take down G2 in order to continue their tournament run.</p>
