Hamas appeared to rule out the possibility of a limited cease-fire in order to exchange hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners, according to a statement released through the group’s official media.</p><p>The Biden administration had sent key envoys including the C.I.A. director to the region this week, in a push to at least generate some momentum in talks to end Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and its spiraling conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>But the envoys departed the region on both fronts without any apparent or immediate results in either conflict.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese armed group backed by Iran, continued to fire scores of rockets and drones at Israel, setting off air-raid sirens across the country’s north. The Israeli strikes in Lebanon caused “massive destruction” and flattened buildings, according to Lebanese state media.</p><p>The strikes near Beirut hit the southern outskirts of Lebanon’s capital, a cluster of neighborhoods known as the Dahiya, where Hezbollah largely holds sway. In central Lebanon, Israeli jets bombarded targets in several villages, killing at least 52 people and wounding 26, according to the Lebanese health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.</p><p>The Israeli military has widened its campaign against Hezbollah in recent days, expanding beyond Lebanon’s border villages and the militant group’s strongholds to port towns and cities where the group has supporters, including Baalbek, Tyre and Sidon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vehicles damaged at the site of an Israeli airstrike that killed five people and injured seven in the Baalbek district of the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Israel’s fight with Hezbollah began after Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Hezbollah then began firing on Israeli positions in solidarity, leading to months of cross-border exchanges, until Israel dramatically escalated its attacks into Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">killing the group’s longtime leader</a> in late September and starting a ground invasion on Oct. 1.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Neither Israel nor Hezbollah, despite the heavy blows the group has been dealt, has indicated a willingness to back down.</p><p>The militant group’s new leader, Naim Qassem, suggested on Wednesday he was open to finding terms for a truce only “with the conditions that we see as appropriate and suitable.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in turn, may be waiting for the results of the U.S. presidential election next week before deciding what approach to take in the war, analysts say.</p><p>Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s lead envoy on the Lebanon talks, left Israel after meeting with Mr. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders alongside Brett McGurk, another senior U.S. official. Political analysts said his swift return to Washington — rather than heading to Beirut for further diplomacy — suggested that the negotiators were not close to an imminent deal.</p><p>Najib Mikati, the caretaker prime minister of Lebanon, said Friday that the renewed Israeli airstrikes in Beirut indicated that Israel had rejected “all efforts being expended for a cease-fire.” He pledged again to implement the long moribund United Nations resolution that ended the previous war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>On Thursday, Mr. Netanyahu had told graduating officers at the Israeli military’s command school that Israel was determined to “enforce security, thwart attacks against us, and act against the arming of our enemies.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At the site of an Israeli airstrike that targeted a house in the village of Douris in eastern Lebanon on Friday, a man reconnects a wire that held up a poster of two men that were killed in 2015.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Hezbollah will not sit on our northern border, at positions a few meters from our border, from which it could invade. This will not happen anymore,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised address.</p><p>Deadlock has similarly prevailed in cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas, which have been fighting now for over a year. In Gaza, more than 42,000 people have been killed since then, according to local health officials, and hundreds of thousands of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/middleeast/gaza-displaced-winter-tents.html" title="">have fled their homes</a>, many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/world/middleeast/gaza-farms-famine.html" title="">facing the prospect of famine</a>.</p><p>On Friday, the Israeli military asserted that it had killed Izz al-Din Kassab, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, in a strike in the area of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Hamas did not immediately confirm whether he had been killed.</p><p>Negotiators had sought to jump-start talks over the past few weeks to reach at least a temporary truce in the wake of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-dead.html" title="">Israel’s killing of Yahya Sinwar</a>, the leader of Hamas, in October.
