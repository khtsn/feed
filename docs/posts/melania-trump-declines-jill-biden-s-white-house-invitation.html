Trump to the White House for his meeting on Wednesday with President Biden, a longtime ritual between the current and future presidents that the wives normally attend as well.</p><p>“In this instance, several unnamed sources in the media continue to provide false, misleading and inaccurate information,” Mrs. Trump’s office said in a statement, an apparent explanation for her absence. It was unclear who in the media her office was referring to and what information it objected to.</p><p>Her office did, however, sound a note of congratulations to Mr. Trump on behalf of his wife. “Her husband’s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is unclear if Mrs. Trump will move back into the White House with her husband when he takes office in January. During the first term, it took Mrs. Trump months to move to Washington from Trump Tower in New York. Once she did, she had a fraught relationship with the media, as well as with a number of first lady traditions in the White House, including presiding over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/elections/a-recording-of-melania-trump-captures-her-complaining-in-vulgar-terms-about-christmas-decorations-and-mocking-detained-migrant-c.html" title="">annual Christmas decorations</a>, which she complained about in profane terms.</p><p>White House officials said that the current first lady, Dr. Biden, gave Mr. Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for Mrs. Trump, which also expressed her team’s readiness to assist with the transition.</p><p>Mrs. Trump’s snub of Dr. Biden was a first in modern memory, and was particularly striking because the two husbands were meeting after exchanging ugly insults in a bitter campaign.</p><p>However, Anita McBride, an expert on first ladies at American University who served as chief of staff to Laura Bush during former President George W. Bush’s second term, gave Mrs. Trump a pass.</p><p>“It’s different this time,” Ms. McBride said. “She knows what she’s walking into — doesn’t need a tour. I like to see the tradition upheld, but Mrs. Trump has shown us for years she will do things her way and not be burdened by others’ expectations of her. ”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While Mrs. Trump has not said why she did not attend tea with Dr. Biden, she has been vocal about her anger over the F.B.I. search of her home at the couple’s private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, in August 2022 in search of classified documents from Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>When Mr. Trump was first elected president in 2016, Michelle Obama, then the first lady, hosted her for an awkward tea and a tour at the White House.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/transition-briefing-passing-the-presidency-to-donald-trump.html" title="">The two women</a> stepped out on the Truman Balcony, with sweeping views of the grounds and the Washington Monument, strolled through the State Floor with the resident curator, and even talked about raising children at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/melania-trump-michelle-obama-white-house/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A photo released</a> by the White House showed them sitting next to each other in gold chairs speaking in the Yellow Oval Room, at the White House residence.</p><p>But when she and her husband left the White House in 2020, Mrs. Trump did not reach out to Dr. Biden about transition matters. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/melania-trump.html" title="">she and Mr. Trump did not invite</a> the Bidens into the White House on Inauguration Day, as has long been the custom.</p><p>A person familiar with Dr. Biden’s thinking said at the time that since Mr. Trump had not conceded to Mr. Biden it would not make sense for the two to meet. That person added that Dr. Biden knew her way around, anyway. Now the tables are turned. It is Mrs. Trump who knows her way around.</p><p>Mrs. Trump has not yet outlined how she plans to go about the role in the next administration. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sheryl Gay Stolberg covers health policy for The Times from Washington.
