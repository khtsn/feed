As the critic Joel Selvin said, “There was Black music before Sly Stone, and Black music after Sly Stone.”</p><p>His musical legacy was fortified and refreshed in recent years, a push led by the musician and music historian Questlove, who directed the Academy Award-winning documentary “Summer of Soul,” from 2021, which included a performance by Sly and the Family Stone during a Harlem cultural festival in 1969. That film was followed in 2023 by a memoir by Mr. Stone, “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” and last year Questlove released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/movies/sly-lives-aka-the-burden-of-black-genius-review.html" title="">documentar</a>y devoted entirely to him, “Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius).”</p><p>From 1968 to 1971, Sly and the Family Stone released a defining string of albums — “A Whole New Thing,” “Dance to the Music,” “Life,” “Stand!” and “There’s a Riot Goin’ On” — that were celebratory but also knowing about the fragile state of the world, complicating the Summer of Love’s themes of unity and sounds of euphoria with a street savvy that presaged the end of the party, even as the band played on.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The group stomped, grooved and shouted its way into the national consciousness with a medley of songs now regarded as classics on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in 1968. Sly and the Family Stone soon dominated the charts and further established itself as an era-defining act with similarly jarring, joyous appearances at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Woodstock festival in 1969.</p><p>The band’s most recognizable songs from that era, which would go on to be sampled frequently, included “Everyday People,” “Dance to the Music,” “I Want to Take You Higher,” “Family Affair,” “Hot Fun in the Summertime” and “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).”</p><p><em>A complete obituary will appear shortly.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Coscarelli is a culture reporter for The Times who focuses on popular music and a co-host of the Times podcast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/popcast-pop-music-podcast">“Popcast (Deluxe).”</a></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
