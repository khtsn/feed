Huge stretches of communities across the Midwest and South were reduced to rubble. A governor lost a farmhouse to fire.

Long-lasting tornadoes, which are rarer, had been forecast this past week, and on Sunday, meteorologists were assessing the recent series of them. Emily Thornton, a meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center called it “a high-end severe event.” But it wasn’t totally out of the realm for what happens in March and April.</p><p>In terms of the number of tornadoes, this outbreak was not an outlier. The most recent outbreak in the United States was on March 31 and April 1, 2023, when 146 tornadoes caused 26 deaths, according to William Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-63145d01">The winds accelerated wildfires across the Plains.</h2><p>Hurricane-force winds fanned wildfires that spread rapidly in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas. The worst damage was in Oklahoma, where more than 400 homes and other structures were destroyed. At least four people have died in the state from the fires or high winds, and 142 people have been injured, the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/oem/news/newsroom/wildfire-situation-update-3---march-16-2025.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Sunday</a>.</p><p>In Stillwater, a city of about 50,000 that is home to Oklahoma State University, dozens of homes burned. Gov. Kevin Stitt was among the victims — he shared video of a farmhouse he owned in Luther, outside of Oklahoma City, in ruins.</p><p>Oklahoma residents deal with the threat of tornadoes all the time. But for many, encountering wildfires was a whole new experience.</p><p>J. Bryson Baker, 39, has spent his entire life in Stillwater. He had never fled a fire, until Friday. His family evacuated from their home in southwestern Stillwater to stay with relatives in Oklahoma City.</p><p>When he returned at nightfall, he said he saw flames 60 feet tall, emitting so much heat that he didn’t know how firefighters could stand it. The blaze destroyed his backyard fence and part of his backyard. His one-story brick home was untouched. But other homes were in rubble.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Stillwater, Okla., a city of about 50,000 that is home to Oklahoma State University, dozens of homes burned.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nick Oxford/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Homes destroyed by fires in Mannford, Okla.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott Olson/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alecia Dresslaer holds her 3-month-old baby while surveying damage to her home in Mannford.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Scott Olson/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We’re tornado alley,” said Mr. Baker, whose home was destroyed by a twister when he was about 8 years old. “We’re typically not built or warned or necessarily prepared for wildfires.”</p><h2 id="link-5722101d">Dust storms led to deaths on the roads in two states.</h2><p>The fierce winds also produced dust storms in Texas and Kansas that killed at least 12 people. In the region around Lubbock and Amarillo in Texas, officials reported more than three dozen car crashes, killing at least four people. Images on social media showed a dystopian view of the area, featuring a thick, brownish-gray haze. A man making a video could be heard saying: “You want to go to Mars? This is Mars.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In western Kansas, eight people were killed in a vehicle pileup during a dust storm that created near-zero visibility conditions on Interstate 70 near the Colorado border, the Kansas Highway Patrol said. Forty-six people were taken to hospitals.</p><h2 id="link-4f35e02f">As the storm system subsides, a new one is rolling in.</h2><p>On Monday, the storm system, which also brought hail to parts of Indiana and Kentucky over the weekend, is expected to move offshore. But as a separate storm system rolls in, critical fire conditions are expected to return on Monday and Tuesday, with strong winds predicted across eastern New Mexico, central and western Texas, western Oklahoma and southeastern Colorado.</p><p>As of early Monday morning, more than 36 million people in the United States, mostly in the Plains, were under a red flag warning, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/images/crh/dhs/wwa_population.png" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the National Weather Service</a>.
