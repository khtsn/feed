Over the weekend, Mr. Tran went ahead by 36 votes. And on Tuesday, he extended his lead to 314 votes. Nearly 310,000 ballots have been cast overall.</p><p>While Republicans have already secured control of the House, the race will determine just how slim the party’s majority will be come January, when the new class of lawmakers is sworn in. If Mr. Tran wins, it would be the second California seat picked up this election by Democrats, a small victory amid a sea of national losses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>California is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/california-ballot-count-house-election.html" title="">notoriously slow at counting</a> because the vast majority of voters submit mail-in ballots and the state has a lengthy verification process along with laws that afford various protections to residents.</p><p>With thousands of ballots still to be counted in the district, both campaigns are focusing their efforts to “cure” ballots, or to fix rejected submissions on which a voter’s signature is missing or does not match the one on file.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19trump-news-ca-45-2-qbfz/19trump-news-ca-45-2-qbfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19trump-news-ca-45-2-qbfz/19trump-news-ca-45-2-qbfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/19/multimedia/19trump-news-ca-45-2-qbfz/19trump-news-ca-45-2-qbfz-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Campaign signs for Derek Tran and Michelle Steel in front of a Buddhist temple.

Some ballots cast by older people had also been rejected because of shaky penmanship, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In California, voters can fix their uncounted ballots until Dec. 1, when counties in the state are required to finalize their tallies. In California, recounts can be requested within five days of an election being certified.</p><p>“Elections do not end on Election Day,” Ms. Levenson said. “They end when we finish the election curing process.”</p><p>While leaders in California have been defending their deliberate methods as critical to ensuring accuracy and inclusivity, the delays have also made the process vulnerable to disinformation. When Mr. Tran took the lead last weekend, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia accused Democrats on X of “stealing a House seat right out from under us” without providing evidence.</p><p>Republicans in California, however, said they had prepared for such delays and had their own network of volunteers working in the 45th District until the count becomes final.</p><p>Jessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the California Republican Party, said in a statement last week that her organization had “the largest Republican ballot curing operation underway in state history as we work to pull several too-close-to-call races over the finish line for our candidates.”</p><p>She added later that the 45th District remained a “primary focus” for the party.</p><p>“This race is still far too close to call,” Ms. Patterson said, vowing to keep pressing on until the “last legal vote is cured and counted.”</p><p>Soumya Karlamangla<!-- --> contributed reporting from San Francisco.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Qin writes about Asian American communities for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/amy-qin">More about Amy Qin</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-house-of-representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
