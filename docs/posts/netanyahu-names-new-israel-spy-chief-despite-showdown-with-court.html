The court temporarily suspended the dismissal of the current spy chief earlier this month, though it allowed Mr. Netanyahu to interview candidates to replace him.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office announced that Eli Sharvit, a former head of the Israeli Navy, would succeed Ronen Bar, the current head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic spy agency. Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet decided earlier in March that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-ronen-bar.html" title="">Mr. Bar would be dismissed early</a> from his post, as soon as a successor was installed — leading the Supreme Court to intervene.</p><p>For now, the prime minister has stopped just short of creating a constitutional crisis. His spokesman, Omer Dostri, said that Mr. Sharvit’s installation in the role would be delayed until after the Supreme Court holds a hearing on April 8 about the legality of Mr. Bar’s dismissal.</p><p>But the decision to nominate a new chief before the court hearing has raised concerns about whether Mr. Netanyahu will abide by the judges’ decisions, potentially creating a clash between the judicial and executive arms of government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The standoff over Mr. Bar is at the heart of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/world/middleeast/israel-judicial-reform-netanyahu.html" title="">a bitter dispute among Israelis</a> about how the country should be governed. Mr. Netanyahu’s attempt to fire Mr. Bar is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-firing.html" title="">the latest in a sequence of moves</a> by the prime minister to expand his executive power and diminish the influence and independence of the judiciary and law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Last week, Israel’s governing coalition passed a law in Parliament that gives politicians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-judges.html" title="">more control over the selection of Supreme Court justices</a>. And earlier in March, the cabinet began the process of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/israel-attorney-general.html" title="">firing the government’s top lawyer</a>, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has angered Mr. Netanyahu by questioning the legality of government decisions — including the dismissal of Mr. Bar.</p><p>To Mr. Netanyahu and his supporters, the moves are an attempt to enhance Israel’s democracy by giving elected lawmakers greater control over the country’s direction. To his opponents, they are an attempt to shield politicians from scrutiny and accountability, edging Israel toward autocracy.</p><p>Critics also say that the move against Ms. Baharav-Miara, who oversees the ongoing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/the-netanyahu-corruption-trial-explained.html" title="">prosecution of Mr. Netanyahu for corruption</a>, is an attempt to undermine the trial. Mr. Netanyahu denies both the corruption charges and the claim that he is trying to undermine the proceedings.</p><p>The dispute over Mr. Bar is seen as emblematic of this rift because he was fired after starting criminal investigations against the prime minister’s aides. Since last fall, the Shin Bet has been assessing whether members of the prime minister’s office had leaked classified information to a foreign newspaper and received payments for people connected to the Qatari government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Monday, the Israeli police announced two people had been arrested in connection with the case. The police did not name the two people, citing a gag order, but the Israeli news media reported that they were members of the prime minister’s bureau. The prime minister has long denied the allegations, as has the Qatari government. Asked for comment, a Qatari government official said the claims were a “smear campaign” aimed at derailing Qatar’s efforts to mediate an end to the war in Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s critics have accused him of firing Mr. Bar for failing to end the investigation.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has denied the charge, saying that Mr. Bar was dismissed because of a breakdown of trust between the two men. Mr. Netanyahu has also blamed Mr. Bar for lapses early on the morning of Oct. 7, 2023, that allowed Hamas to launch its attack on Israel that day and ignite the war in Gaza.</p><p>In announcing Mr. Sharvit’s nomination, Mr. Netanyahu emphasized his chosen candidate’s long career in the Israeli military.</p><p>“Vice Admiral Sharvit served in the I.D.F. for 36 years, including five years as commander of the Israel Navy,” Mr. Netanyahu’s announcement said, using an abbreviation for Israel Defense Forces. He added that Mr. Sharvit helped build the “maritime defense of the territorial waters and conducted complex operations against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.”</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s allies even wondered if Mr. Sharvit might prove too independent, following reports that he had protested in 2023 against the government’s efforts to reduce judicial power.</p><p>But opposition leaders, while acknowledging Mr. Sharvit’s leadership qualities, complained that he had been appointed without due process.</p><p>Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Rehovot, Israel, and <!-- -->Myra Noveck<!-- --> from Jerusalem.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Driving in Singapore: </strong>The city-state, where it costs up to $84,000 just for the right to own a car, is one of the most expensive places to drive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/car-certificate-singapore-luxury.html">That is by design</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Radio Martí Goes Off the Air: </strong>For four decades, a U.S.-financed broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/americas/radio-marti-cuba-trump-castro.html">provoked the ire of the communist government</a> in Cuba.
