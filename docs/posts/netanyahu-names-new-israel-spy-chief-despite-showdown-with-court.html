Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet decided earlier in March that Mr. Bar would be dismissed early from his post, as soon as a successor was installed.</p><p>The prime minister’s move on Monday narrowly averted a constitutional crisis. Officials clarified that Mr. Sharvit’s installation in the role would be delayed until the Supreme Court holds a hearing on April 8 about the legality of Mr. Bar’s dismissal.</p><p>But the episode has already heightened fears among Mr. Netanyahu’s critics that he is trying to expand his power beyond constitutional norms.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s critics have accused him of firing Mr. Bar for investigating the prime minister’s aides, accused of leaking state secrets to a foreign newspaper and working for people connected to a foreign government.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has said Mr. Bar was fired because of a breakdown of trust between the two men. Mr. Netanyahu’s office has also blamed Mr. Bar for lapses early on the morning of Oct. 7, 2023, that allowed Hamas to launch its attack on Israel that day and ignite the war in Gaza.</p><p>The dismissal of Mr. Bar came amid a wider effort by Mr. Netanyahu to diminish the influence of state watchdogs.</p><p>Last week, Israel’s governing coalition passed a law in Parliament that gives politicians more control over the selection of Supreme Court justices. And, earlier in March, the cabinet began the process of firing the government’s top lawyer, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has angered Mr. Netanyahu by questioning the legality of government decisions and overruling them.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Driving in Singapore: </strong>The city-state, where it costs up to $84,000 just for the right to own a car, is one of the most expensive places to drive. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/asia/car-certificate-singapore-luxury.html">That is by design</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Radio Martí Goes Off the Air: </strong>For four decades, a U.S.-financed broadcaster <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/americas/radio-marti-cuba-trump-castro.html">provoked the ire of the communist government</a> in Cuba.
