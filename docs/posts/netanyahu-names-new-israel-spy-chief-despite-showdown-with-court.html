    <h1>Netanyahu Names New Israel Spy Chief Despite Showdown With Court</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s critics have accused him of firing Mr. Bar for investigating the prime minister’s aides, accused of leaking state secrets to a foreign newspaper and working for people connected to a foreign government.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu has said Mr. Bar was fired because of a breakdown of trust between the two men. Mr. Netanyahu’s office has also blamed Mr. Bar for lapses early on the morning of Oct. 7, 2023, that allowed Hamas to launch its attack on Israel that day and ignite the war in Gaza.</p><p>The dismissal of Mr. Bar came amid a wider effort by Mr. Netanyahu to diminish the influence of state watchdogs.</p><p>Last week, Israel’s governing coalition passed a law in Parliament that gives politicians more control over the selection of Supreme Court justices. And, earlier in March, the cabinet began the process of firing the government’s top lawyer, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has angered Mr. Netanyahu by questioning the legality of government decisions and overruling them.</p></div></div>
