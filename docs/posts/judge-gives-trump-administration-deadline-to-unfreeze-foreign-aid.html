    <h1>Judge Gives Trump Administration Deadline to Unfreeze Foreign Aid</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Defendants shall take no actions to impede the prompt payments of appropriated foreign assistance funds, and shall take all necessary actions to ensure the prompt payments of appropriated foreign assistance funds,” he said.</p><p>The order on Tuesday was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/trump-unfreezing-federal-grants-judge-ruling.html" title="">the second time</a> a federal judge had granted a request for a “motion to enforce,” prodding the government to act following signs that it was not obeying an earlier ruling. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Rhode Island granted a similar request after finding that the Trump administration had continued to stall on releasing billions of dollars in federal grants that he had ordered be released.</p><p>Last week, Judge Ali <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333.30.0.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declined</a> to hold the government in contempt of court for defying the earlier order, but continued to press for details. On Tuesday, he also ordered the government to detail what steps it was taking to make payments in a status report due at noon on Wednesday.</p><p>The ruling also came as the Trump administration has attempted to slow-walk its compliance by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/trump-foreign-aid-freeze.html" title="">invoking other legal authorities</a> to effectuate the intended blanket freeze on foreign aid, including carrying out a comprehensive, line-by-line review process for foreign assistance grants.</p><p>When asked on Tuesday whether the government had taken any steps to resume payments, Mr. Sur brought up some of those statutes and regulations, apparently to justify why the government may not have done so.</p><p>“I assume you know it’s not enough to just come up with a legal authority,” Judge Ali said.</p><p>“I hope you understand why this is important, as the attorney advising your client,” he added.</p></div></div>
