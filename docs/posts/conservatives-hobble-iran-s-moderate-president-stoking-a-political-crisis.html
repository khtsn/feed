In Iran’s theocratic system, while there is an elected government, appointed bodies dominated by clerics disqualify candidates they deem unacceptable, which contributed to very low turnout in recent parliamentary elections, and they can block legislation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Pezeshkian reacted to the ouster of two of his top allies by delivering an unusually scathing public speech in Parliament on Sunday. He appeared flabbergasted and angry, at times raising his voice and waving his hands, and said Iran was engaged in “a full-fledged war” with external enemies.</p><p>“From the day we took over the government, we were confronted with deficiencies in energy, water and power, and on the other hand extreme debts on payments to the agriculture sector for wheat, the health and medical sector, and retirement salaries and so on,” Mr. Pezeshkian said, according to videos and texts of his speech.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Finance Minister Abdolnasser Hemmati arrives at the podium to speak during Sunday’s open session of Parliament in which he was impeached.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vahid Salemi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He said the government had a massive budget deficit. It couldn’t make its payments to its workers, contractors or retirees, he said, and withdrew $1 billion from an emergency fund just to stay afloat.</p><p>Wars with Israel have devastated Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinian group Hamas, both backed by Iran, and have killed the leaders of both groups. Rebels have toppled the government of Syria, Iran’s closest regional ally. And President Trump has returned to office, along with his policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, through economic sanctions, to curb its nuclear program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Those external events, Mr. Pezeshkian said, “have added one problem after another to our problems.”</p><p>He revealed that as a result of Mr. Trump’s enforcement of tough sanctions, Iran was struggling to sell its crude oil, leaving its tankers lingering idly at sea, and that even friendly nations like Iraq, Qatar and Turkey were not letting Iran access and transfer its cash revenues.</p><p>The president was also remarkably frank about his disagreement with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on nuclear talks with the West and Mr. Trump. Mr. Pezeshkian said he favored negotiations, but the ayatollah rejected them, so “it’s over and done.”</p><p>“My position has been and will remain that I believe in negotiations, but now we have to follow the parameters set by the supreme leader,” he said, adding that Mr. Khamenei set the policies and the president merely executed them.</p><p>Analysts said that Mr. Pezeshkian wanted to shift the blame for the standoff with the United States and its consequences — more sanctions, further deterioration of the economy and even possible Israeli strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. Both the United States and Israel have accused Iran of working toward developing nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, insisting its program is strictly for civilian purposes. The U.N.’s atomic agency, which monitors Iran’s nuclear sites, has said Iran has not yet militarized its program.</p><p>“Without being able to push forward economic reforms at home, which is interlinked to reaching out to the West and sanctions being removed, his presidency will be an absolute failure,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran director for the International Crisis Group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Pezeshkian, who took office in August, has emphasized a policy of unity with domestic rivals in the name of smoother governance. He even picked cabinet members from across the political aisle, including the minister of justice, defying the advice of members of his own party who warned against trusting conservatives.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A currency exchange store in Tehran, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But for weeks conservatives have battered his government over the currency, the rial, <a href="https://alanchand.com/en/currencies-price/usd-hav" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">losing nearly 50 percent of its value</a> against the dollar on the unofficial market since the new government took office. (The official exchange rate, far more favorable to the rial, is available only to a select few.) Prices on consumer goods respond to the fluctuating currency and have spiked astronomically. Iranian media reported the price of rice, a staple of Persian cooking, has increased 100 percent, legumes 200 percent and potatoes 300 percent.</p><p>In Tehran, the recent government chaos dominates the front pages of the major daily newspapers with some calling the ousters “political score settling,” and one asking, “strategic mistake or victory of opponents?”</p><p>The topic of negotiations with Washington has been a major flashpoint between the conservatives and Mr. Pezeshkian, who campaigned on the promise to improve the economy by negotiating to remove sanctions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In the weeks following Mr. Trump’s election and his comments about preferring a deal with Iran over military strikes against nuclear sites, Iranian officials from the president to the foreign minister said they were open to talks with Washington. Many pundits wrote front-page essays in Iranian media calling on the government to seize the opportunity of an opening with Mr. Trump.</p><p>But hard-liners bent on defeating any compromise with Mr. Trump began a fierce campaign to oust Mr. Zarif, suspecting he would become a facilitator once again in diplomacy with America. As foreign minister, Mr. Zarif spearheaded negotiations for the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, including the United States, that placed limits on Iran’s nuclear program.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mohammad Javad Zarif, second from left, with Mr. Pezeshkian after voting in the presidential election in Tehran in July.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">Mr. Trump abandoned the deal</a> in 2018, during his first term and tightened sanctions, saying it would lead to lead to a better deal with tougher restrictions on Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

Mr. Zarif’s two children were born in the United States and have dual citizenship.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In a statement posted on his account <a href="https://x.com/JZarif/status/1896382003911458984" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on X announcing his departure,</a> Mr. Zarif said “in the past six months my family and I have faced vicious insults, smears and threats and I experienced the most bitter days of my 40-year career in government, but I persevered with the intent to serve.” The tide in Tehran turned against negotiations with the United States when Mr. Trump signed an executive order tightening sanctions to make it difficult for Iran to evade them, with the aim of reducing Iran’s oil sales to zero.</p><p>Mr. Khamenei, who had reluctantly acquiesced to the 2015 deal, and other conservatives saw Mr. Trump’s reversal as proof that the United States could not be trusted.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s blowup with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House last week is being presented in Iran as further validation of that view.</p><p>Large banners have gone up <a href="https://khabaronline.ir/news/2032268/%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%BE-%D9%88-%D8%B2%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B3%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%B7%D8%AD-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around Tehran showing Mr. Trump lecturing Mr. Zelensky</a>, with messages that read, “the end of a delusion,” and “the result of relying on the wind.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“We will not negotiate with America under a maximum pressure policy,” a government spokeswoman, Fatemeh Mohajerai, said on Tuesday. “We don’t want to experience humiliation like Zelensky.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A banner on the side of an overpass in Tehran showing pictures of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine with President Joseph Biden, left, and President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mohamad Hossein Ebrahimi, an analyst in Tehran who is close to the government, said in a telephone interview that after the fiasco with Mr. Zelensky, “everyone is wondering if Trump does this with allies, what will he do with the enemy?”</p><p>The political upheaval of the past few days has been costly for Mr. Pezeshkian.
