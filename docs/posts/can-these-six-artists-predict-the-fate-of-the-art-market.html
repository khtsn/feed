It is a season of conventional offerings with very few headline-grabbing estates or deals at a time when these companies are suffering from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d9b5daf-254b-477e-b18e-c9e33a3d299d" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">layoffs</a>; seeking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/arts/design/christies-sothebys-luxury-goods.html" title="">outside investments</a>; and weathering a 20 percent decline in sales within the industry’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/arts/design/art-basel-ubs-art-market-report.html" title="">broader downturn</a> that has seen global sales fall to $57.5 billion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The upper reaches of the market over $5 million are very quiet right now,” said Jacob King, an art adviser in New York. “Material you would have seen in the day sale is now in the evening sale.”</p><p>Despite those challenges, the auction houses are still betting on themselves to raise mountains of money within a single week at Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips in New York. Their combined estimate is $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion.</p><p>“Last season was a tough one because we had to put together the sales brick by brick,” Lisa Dennison, a top executive at Sotheby’s, said of the November auctions. “Going into the May sales, we did feel the pipeline flowing a bit more.”</p><p>Drew Watson, head of art services at Bank of America Private Bank, pointed out that some of the largest consignments of the season were announced in April, after President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — giving some reason for optimism. “You would expect that if people were really bearish about the art market right now that a lot of those high-end lots would not be coming to the market,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But the market remains soft, and new ultrawealthy collectors scarce, increasing the pressure on auction houses to perform. Here are six bellwether artworks in the evening sales that may indicate the health of the art market.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Alberto Giacometti, “Grande tête mince (Grande tête de Diego),” a tribute in bronze to his brother, is estimated to sell for over $70 million at Sotheby’s Tuesday evening.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Succession Alberto Giacometti/Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY; via Sotheby&#39;s</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-6363475c">Alberto Giacometti</h2><p><strong>“Grande tête mince (Grande tête de Diego)” (1955), in excess of $70 million, Sotheby’s Modern Evening Auction, Tuesday</strong></p><p>Giacometti was toward the end of his career when he created this bronze bust of his brother Diego, the artist’s studio assistant and muse. The sculpture has the highest estimate in New York’s spring sales and comes without a minimum financial guarantee from either Sotheby’s or a third party to ensure the artwork sells, as is typical with expensive lots. The seller, the Soloviev Foundation, a nonprofit founded by the real estate tycoon Sheldon Solow, stands to receive a bigger payout if the work sells for its estimate.</p><p>Solow, who died in 2020, acquired the work in 1980 from the Maeght family, which established the first private art foundation in France, the Fondation Maeght. The foundation is offloading the bust to support its philanthropies, which include the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Henry Street Settlement, according to its <a href="https://solovievfoundation.org/philanthropy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>“This one has always been the mother lode,” Simon Shaw, a Sotheby’s executive who helped arrange the sale, said of the Giacometti, which was cast during the artist’s lifetime. He described it as a “great sculpture in the season where it would be the most exciting thing available by some significant margin.”</p><p>Another cast of the artwork sold at <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5313326?ldp_breadcrumb=back" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christie’s in 2010</a> for $53.3 million; adjusted for inflation, the price today would be $78.1 million, suggesting the artwork has appreciated very little in the last 15 years. Experts said the one being offered at Sotheby’s could sell for more because it is the only painted cast in the series.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Piet Mondrian, “Composition with Large Red Plane, Bluish Gray, Yellow, Black and Blue,” estimated at about $50 million, come up for sale Monday at Christie’s.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Christie&#39;s</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-721749ac">Piet Mondrian</h2><p><strong>“Composition With Large Red Plane, Bluish Gray, Yellow, Black and Blue” (1922), about $50 million, Christie’s, Leonard &amp; Louise Riggio: Collected Works, Monday</strong></p><p>When the Barnes &amp; Noble founder Leonard Riggio died last year, he and his widow, Louise, had acquired an immense art collection, championing blue-chip minimalist art and donating to nonprofits like the Dia Foundation, as well as modern paintings by masters like Pablo Picasso, Rene Magritte and Fernand Léger that hung in their Park Avenue apartment.</p><p>Louise decided to sell the apartment and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/arts/design/barnes-noble-riggio-auction-art-mondrian.html" title="">consign nearly 40 artworks</a> to Christie’s, including a Mondrian painting that will be the auction house’s most expensive artwork this season, with an estimate around $50 million.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/18/arts/design/mondrian-flowers.html" title="">Mondrian</a> is considered a pioneer of European abstraction, thanks to his early experiments in color and geometry in the 1920s. These days, the financial value of his paintings is tied to the proportion of red covering the canvas, making the Riggio example a potential record-breaker. (A previous benchmark was set in 2022 at Sotheby’s, when a similar artwork sold to an anonymous buyer for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/arts/design/sothebys-auction-mondrian.html" title="">$51 million</a>.)</p><p>But that Mondrian was sold during the market’s height, leading industry analysts to debate whether the prestige of the Riggio name can overcome the economic uncertainty at play today. The auction house has also taken a large risk in providing a guarantee for all artworks, meaning that Christie’s will need to buy in whatever fails to sell.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“They did a big house guarantee and are having trouble selling it off,” said King, the art adviser. “It’s good material, but these are big estimates and there is a lot of stuff to sell.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olga de Amaral’s “Imagen perdida 27 (Lost Image 27)” will be auctioned Tuesday at Phillips -- marking her move, at age 93, to the upper echelon of the marketplace.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Olga de Amaral; via Phillips, New York</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-6674ca4f">Olga de Amaral</h2><p><strong>“Imagen perdida 27 (Lost Image 27)” (1996), $300,000 to $500,000, Phillips Modern and Contemporary Art evening auction, Tuesday</strong></p><p>A tapestry by the 93-year-old Colombian artist Olga de Amaral marks her first appearance in a major New York evening auction — the latest symbol that yet another under-known female artist has moved from the fringes of the marketplace to its upper echelon.</p><p>“She’s really a rediscovery, and finally coming out of the pigeonhole,” said Jean-Paul Engelen, a Phillips executive. “She’s no longer a craft artist or a Latin artist. She’s just an artist.”</p><p>Many of the other female artists featured this season are either bona fide auction stars whose work reliably sells for millions of dollars (like Agnes Martin, Georgia O’Keeffe and Cecily Brown), or rising talents with low estimates of $100,000 or less (like Danielle Mckinney, Emma McIntyre and Ilana Savdie). De Amaral stands somewhere between them, as an established artist whose value is still climbing after the opening of her first major European museum survey at the <a href="https://www.fondationcartier.com/en/exhibitions/olga-de-amaral" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fondation Cartier</a> in Paris last October.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olga de Amaral’s 2006 tapestry “Imagen Paisaje I (Landscape Image I)” has a high estimate of $1.5 million at Sotheby’s day sale.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Sotheby&#39;s</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The seller of the tapestry bought the artwork directly from de Amaral in 1996. The artist has woven grids of linen covered in gold leaf to create shimmering abstractions. Three more of her artworks are in New York’s crowded day sales, including the 2006 tapestry “Imagen Paisaje I (Landscape Image I),” which has a high estimate of <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/contemporary-day-auction/imagen-paisaje-i" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1.5 million</a> at Sotheby’s.</p><p>That Phillips has chosen a lower-priced work for its evening sales is a sign that the auction house struggled this season to pull significant consignments from sellers, according to experts. The company’s total estimate for the evening sales is far below its competitors and its top lot — a 1984 Basquiat painting with a high estimate of <a href="https://www.phillips.com/detail/jean-michel-basquiat/219475" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$6.5 million</a> — is almost 90 percent less than the <a href="https://www.phillips.com/detail/jeanmichel-basquiat/NY010324/5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top lot offered</a> in last year’s equivalent sale.</p><p>“In this market, what we have, we feel we can sell well,” Engelen said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A tri-panel work, “Baby Boom,” by Jean-Michel Basquiat, incorporates elements of graffiti art and Neo-Expressionism.

Four decades later, Basquiat has knocked out all competitors — including the former champion Warhol — to become a bellwether in the art market, according to Christie’s global president Alex Rotter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“If you asked me to name one artist, it’s Basquiat,” Rotter said. “Over the past five years, he has the broadest attraction to people at different price levels.”</p><p>After a prolonged buying frenzy for Warhol paintings, most prime examples now reside in museums and private collections that are reluctant to sell. His absence in the market allowed Basquiat to become a standard-bearer because his paintings and drawings still frequently circulate.</p><p>The appearance of Warhol’s “Big Electric Chair” will test if the ultrawealthy’s appetite for the artist has shifted. It is the lone Warhol piece estimated to sell for more than $10 million this season and shows Warhol’s fascination with America’s dark underbelly. <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6534259?ldp_breadcrumb=back" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Big Electric Chair”</a> was featured in the artist’s first European and U.S. museum surveys. In 2019, a <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6236048" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multicolored version</a> of the piece sold at a Christie’s auction just above its low estimate at $19 million.</p><p>The screen print is also competing in the same price range as <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6534763" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Basquiat’s “Baby Boom”</a> painting — one of the artist’s most accessible works from 1982, widely considered the best year of his career. The painting is an art historical sendup of religious iconography, reinterpreting the holy family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph as the artist and his parents.</p><p>Rotter said the Basquiat painting showed the evolution of the artist’s style. “It’s ’81 where the radical Basquiat comes out. It’s ’82 where he has confidence with the radicality.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Carroll Dunham’s vividly-colored “Bathers Seventeen (Black Hole),” will be auctioned at Sotheby’s New York Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Sotheby&#39;s</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><h2 id="link-1ff0a125">Carroll Dunham</h2><p><strong>“Bathers Seventeen (Black Hole)” (2011-12), $250,000 to $350,000, Collection of Barbara Gladstone, Sotheby’s, Thursday</strong></p><p>Sotheby’s is holding dedicated auctions of artwork owned by two respected gallerists on the same night, a collection from the London gallerist <a href="https://luxembourgco.com/press/113/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniella Luxembourg</a> with a high estimate of $41.1 million and a more modest group once held by Barbara Gladstone, with a high estimate of $17.2 million.</p><p>Gladstone, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/arts/barbara-gladstone-dead.html" title="">who died last year at 89</a>, was a generational force in the art world responsible for boosting artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray into the limelight.
