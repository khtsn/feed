    <h1>Justices Seemed Open to Allowing a Religious Charter School</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Supreme Court appeared open today to allowing Oklahoma to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/supreme-court-charter-school.html" title="">use government money to run the nation’s first religious charter school</a>. A decision in favor of the school could lead to the opening of similar institutions across the country and lower the wall separating church and state.</p><p>The main question in the case is whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor and finance religious charter schools. In other words, the Supreme Court is deciding whether charter schools, which are publicly funded and privately run, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/charter-schools-public-private-supreme-court.html" title="">fundamentally public or private</a>.</p><p>During arguments today, the court’s conservative justices were largely sympathetic to the school, while the liberal ones were quite wary. However, Justice Amy Coney Barrett <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/amy-coney-barrett-recuse.html" title="">recused herself from the case</a> without explanation. That left the court’s chief justice, John Roberts, with the likely deciding vote. He was less pointed than the other Republican appointees but still expressed doubt that religious charter schools were different from other groups the court had protected from discrimination.</p><p>The case is one of the most significant of the term, so the court will probably not issue a decision until late June or early July.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The prison in Tecoluca, El Salvador, where Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia is being held.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jose Cabezas/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6601d2bb">A look behind Trump’s migrant deal with El Salvador</h2><p>The Trump administration recently sent a letter to officials in El Salvador requesting the return of a migrant who had been wrongly deported.

Underlying economic growth remained solid, and the G.D.P. drop was driven almost entirely by a huge increase in imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods and materials before Trump’s tariffs took effect. But tariffs and uncertainty have increased in the last month, prompting economists to warn that growth could continue to slow.</p><p><strong>In related news, </strong>stocks performed worse in Trump’s first 100 days compared with how they did at the start of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/trump-stocks-tariffs.html" title="">every presidential term since 1974</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Students left school in McDonald, Pa., during the storm yesterday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lucy Schaly/The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-53e3117">A deadly storm tore through Pennsylvania</h2><p>Hundreds of thousands of people in Pennsylvania were still without power this afternoon after a powerful storm plowed through the area yesterday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/weather/northeast-storms-outages-deaths-pennsylvania.html" title="">At least four people were killed</a>, including a 22-year-old man who was electrocuted while trying to put out a mulch fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-55bd377a">More top news</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Immigration: </strong>Mohsen Mahdawi<strong>, </strong>a Columbia student who was arrested at a citizenship interview, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/nyregion/columbia-student-mohsen-mahdawi-freed.html" title="">was released on bail</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Syria:</strong> Israel, which has a substantial Druse community, said that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/syria-sectarian-fighting-druse.html" title="">struck a group of “operatives” south of Damascus</a> and accused them of having “attacked Druse civilians.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Europe: </strong>A Spanish official said that the cause of Monday’s blackout <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/power-outage-spain-portugal-cause.html" title="">was still unknown</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>India: </strong>After last week’s terrorist attack in Kashmir, officials and right-wing Hindu groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/india-muslims-detentions-demolitions.html" title="">intensified harassment of Muslims</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trade: </strong>In an early sign of the toll of Trump’s tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/business/china-pmi-factory-manufacturing.html" title="">manufacturing in China slowed down</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Research: </strong>Data from more than 200,000 people shows that young people aren’t as happy as they used to be — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/well/mind/happiness-flourishing-young-adult-study.html" title="">and that the happiness curve is collapsing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vatican: </strong>About a fifth of all Catholics are African. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/africa/next-pope-francis.html" title="">The next pope could be, too</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Court: </strong>Next month, the music mogul Sean Combs will face federal charges of sex trafficking.
