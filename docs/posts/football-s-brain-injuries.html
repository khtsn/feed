    <h1>Football’s Brain Injuries</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The gunman who opened fire in a Manhattan office building had a note in his wallet claiming that years of playing football had left him with a brain disease known as C.T.E. He inveighed against the N.F.L., which has an office in the building, though none of the four people he killed worked there.</p><p>In the end, the gunman, Shane Tamura, shot himself in the chest. “Study my brain please,” the note said. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>We won’t know until experts examine his brain whether Tamura had C.T.E. But we know he played football, the sport most associated with the disease, through high school.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Today’s newsletter explores what we know about C.T.E. and its connections to football and violence.</p><h2 id="link-19e17391">What causes C.T.E.?</h2><p>C.T.E., or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is caused by an accumulation of blows to the head. There have been cases linked to hockey, rugby, wrestling and soccer. The blows needn’t be violent collisions that cause concussions. Rather, the disease seems to progress with both the number of hits and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/sports/football/cte-study-concussions-brain-tackle.html" title="">cumulative impact of all those hits</a>, as the chart below shows:</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Daneshvar, D.H., Nair, E.S., Baucom, Z.H. et al. (2023) | By The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a 2017 study, a neuropathologist examined the brains of 111 dead N.F.L. players. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/sports/football/nfl-cte.html" title="">All but one had C.T.E.</a></p><p>Tamura never made it to the N.F.L. But studies have also found C.T.E. in people who played contact sports in their youth. A 2023 study of 152 athletes who died before age 30 showed that more than 40 percent had C.T.E.</p><h2 id="link-14c71bf5">What about the N.F.L.?</h2><p>Tamura’s note accused the N.F.L. of concealing the danger of football in favor of profits.</p><p>Indeed, the league spent years denying the link between football and brain trauma, and it presented flawed research to bolster its claims, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/sports/football/nfl-concussion-research-tobacco.html" title="">a Times investigation found in 2016</a>. Some former players compared the N.F.L. to Big Tobacco, which had for years used bad science to cover up the harm cigarettes cause.</p><p>Over the past decade, the N.F.L. has changed its stance and added rules to reduce the risk of severe head injuries. Last season, concussions were at a record low. Still, the disease may be the unavoidable result of a game in which players slam into one another on every snap.</p><h2 id="link-3ed4b59f">C.T.E. and violence</h2><p>Doctors can diagnose C.T.E. in someone only after they have died. Because of that, identifying symptoms is difficult. But athletes who were later found to have the disease had displayed similar traits, including impulsive behavior, depression, cognitive impairment and suicidal thoughts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>My colleague Ken Belson, who has covered the disease for years, wrote about notable instances of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/business/nyc-shooting-note-cte-explained.html?smid=url-share" title="">violence by former football players with C.T.E</a>. For instance, Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, shot and killed an acquaintance and later killed himself in prison. Like Tamura, the former N.F.L. players Dave Duerson and Junior Seau shot themselves in the chest, which allowed researchers to study their brains.</p><p>Experts said it would take several weeks or months to determine whether Tamura had C.T.E. They said that, while Tamura’s death fits a pattern, they were hesitant to attribute his attack solely to C.T.E., because violence is a complicated matter that resists simple explanations.</p><p>“Mental health issues come from a lot of different places, not just from brain injuries or C.T.E.,” said Chris Nowinski, co-founder of a nonprofit that supports athletes affected by the disease. “But I also know the history of this issue,<em> </em>and it’s something that keeps me up at night.”</p><h2 id="link-3883a40d">More on the shooting</h2><ul><li><p>Friends and family <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/nyregion/park-avenue-shooting-victims.html" title="">spoke about the four victims</a>: a police officer devoted to his children and his mosque; a gregarious security guard known for his warm smile; a financial executive who mentored women in her workplace and her synagogue; and a former athlete with a “heart of gold.”</p></li><li><p>An N.F.L. employee was seriously injured in the shooting and was in stable condition, the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, said.</p></li><li><p>The shooting was the deadliest in New York City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/nyregion/mass-shooting-midtown-death-toll.html?smid=url-share" title="">in 25 years</a>.</p></li><li><p>Tamura bought a gun legally in his home state of Nevada last month, despite twice being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/nyregion/park-avenue-gunman-mental-health-history.html" title="">held involuntarily after mental health crises</a>, according to law enforcement officials.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-351e780f">Tsunami</h2><p>Tsunami waves are radiating across the Pacific after a major earthquake (8.8 magnitude) struck off Russia’s coast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The epicenter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">US Geological Survey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Damage:</strong> The waves have reached Alaska, California, Hawaii and Washington. So far most have been small, causing minor flooding. Forecasters had warned that waves could reach up to 10 feet in some places; they were about 6 feet above normal in Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Evacuations:</strong> Millions of people along the Pacific Coast evacuated. In Japan, officials shut an airport and told about two million people to move to higher ground. In Hawaii, the governor declared an emergency and traffic filled mountain roads as people fled the sea, but officials there said the threat of widespread destruction had passed. Beaches are closed in parts of California.</p><p><strong>The science:</strong> Tsunamis can travel more than 500 miles per hour in deep water, crossing an ocean in less than a day. Despite their portrayals in Hollywood films, tsunamis are not a single tall, curling wave. They’re actually a series of long waves that look more like sudden floods, crashing ashore in and building up in height. They can also cause powerful currents that last for hours or days. These waves could reach as far as South America.</p><p><strong>The earthquake:</strong> It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/world/asia/earthquake-russia-record.html" title="">one of the largest on record</a> (tied for the sixth biggest, if scientists don’t revise its scale).
