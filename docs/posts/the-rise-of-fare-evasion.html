</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This evasion has become a major financial problem for the transit system, which depends on fares for revenue. The trend has also created a sense of chaos and unfairness. “Something should be done about it,” Mary Parrish, a frustrated 85-year-old retired teacher, told The Times while waiting for a bus in Brooklyn.</p><p>Janno Lieber, chief executive of the transit system, which is known as the M.T.A., has called fare evasion “the No. 1 existential threat” because it creates a sense of lawlessness. “It says at the doorway: This is not an orderly place,” Lieber said. The subways have indeed become less orderly. Violent crime, per subway rider, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/nyc-subway-safety-criminal-justice.html" title="">has risen</a> sharply since 2019, as Nicole Gelinas wrote for Times Opinion. In a survey last year, only 49 percent of daytime subway riders said they felt safe, down from 82 percent in 2017.</p><h2 id="link-7d0e0579">Two big reasons</h2><p>Covid is part of the explanation. The transit system suspended some fare collection in 2020, which fed the notion that paying was optional. Society’s long pandemic shutdowns also seem to have contributed to a malaise from which the country has still not recovered.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But M.T.A. data makes clear that Covid isn’t the only cause of growing fare evasion — because <a href="http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/docs/TAC%202019-03%20Fare%20Evasion%20v6.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it began rising sharply in 2017</a>, not 2020.</p><p>The second big cause is also part of a larger story. In the late 2010s, calls began growing for a more relaxed approach to law enforcement. Crime had fallen so low that it didn’t always seem like a threat. And more people had understandably grown concerned about mass incarceration, given that the U.S. was a global outlier and disproportionately locked up people of color.</p><p>These concerns helped lead to several policy changes. In Oregon, citizens voted to decriminalize all drugs. In Washington D.C., Democratic politicians questioned the importance of immigration enforcement. In New York, the Manhattan district attorney in 2017 stopped pursuing most fare evasion cases, and Brooklyn took similar steps.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Times Square subway station.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chang W. Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>These policies haven’t aged very well. Fare evasion in New York has surged. Oregon, faced with neighborhoods coping with sick addicts and public defecation, recently restored some penalties for drug use. On immigration, the Biden administration’s loosening of border policy has frustrated even many Democratic voters, mayors and governors — and the administration has since reversed itself.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The subway systems in New York and other cities have also made changes. Washington and Philadelphia have installed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/03/23/dc-metro-fare-evasion-gates/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taller barriers</a> to stop people from jumping over fare gates. New York and Chicago have placed more police officers inside the transit system.</p><h2 id="link-3e599115">City life, damaged</h2><p>None of this necessarily means that the old status quo on subways and buses was ideal. Some activists argue that public transit should be free and that higher taxes should cover the system’s costs; critics of this idea reply it would cause transit systems to be underfunded and unreliable.</p><p>There are also thorny questions about what the consequences for fare evasion should be. Few legal experts favor jail. Drug use may offer a useful analogy: As my colleague German Lopez has pointed out, even modest penalties <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/briefing/portugal-portland-decriminalization-overdoses.html" title="">can have a big effect</a> on behavior.</p><p>Whatever the answer, New York’s glorious transit system, a signature part of the city, is struggling. The projected budget deficit is growing, and many regular riders say that today’s chaotic atmosphere has damaged the quality of everyday life.</p><p><strong>For more: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/nyregion/nyc-bus-subway-fare-evasion.html" title="">I recommend reading Ana’s story</a>.
