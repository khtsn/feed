                  <p><a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/12394/betboom" data-tooltip-id="uid801800921">BetBoom</a> are through to the semi-final stage of the Roman Imperium Cup V following a 2-1 victory against <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/8474/100-thieves" data-tooltip-id="uid483551432">100 Thieves</a>. The Russian side came back from 12-4 on Nuke, only to lose the map in overtime, before seeing the match off on Ancient.</p>
                  <p>It was a performance decorated by a world-class performance from <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/20357/d1ledez" data-tooltip-id="uid1637890672">Daniil <span>&#34;⁠d1Ledez⁠&#34;</span> Kustov</a>, who is averaging a 1.50 rating in Vila Nova de Gaia. Like the rest of the team, the 19-year-old is still trying to adapt to the new system implemented by head coach <a href="https://www.hltv.org/coach/1084/fierce" data-tooltip-id="uid567308087">Artem <span>&#34;⁠Fierce⁠&#34;</span> Ivanov</a>, who took charge of the squad last month.</p>
                  <p>&#34;A new coach, new structure, and we&#39;re trying to find our game as a team,&#34; <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/11840/boombl4" data-tooltip-id="uid1463982235">Kirill <span>&#34;⁠Boombl4⁠&#34;</span> Mikhailov</a> told HLTV after the match.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I think he [d1Ledez] is trying to think more and more. That&#39;s why maybe sometimes he can&#39;t kill a lot, but in the future it will be great for everyone.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The win puts <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/12394/betboom" data-tooltip-id="uid801800921">BetBoom</a> on a collision course with <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/13404/gentle-mates" data-tooltip-id="uid421173758">Gentle Mates</a> in the semi-finals, with the Russian team keen to avoid a third straight loss to the Spaniards.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to think about revenge, but still, in my mind it should be,&#34; <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/11840/boombl4" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1463982235">Boombl4</a> said. &#34;And of course, we will prepare, and now it&#39;s again a LAN match. So we will see what happens.</p>
                  <p>&#34;Our team wants to win the tournament right now, because VRS points are really important, and there&#39;s not a lot of time until the Major invites.&#34;</p>

                  <p><strong>A 2-1 against 100 Thieves, victory and you&#39;re through to the semis. Give me your thoughts on the match. You came back from 12-4 down on Nuke and lost the game in overtime, and then you closed it out on Ancient.</strong></p>
                  <p>I&#39;m happy with our performance on the first and third maps. The second map was stupid mistakes, and it snowballed after this. We did a great comeback on the CT side. We were really focused, but in overtime I think we got a bit nervous and lost it. But still, we won the match.</p>
                  <p><strong>Back at PGL Bucharest, Artfr0st said that the team had really high expectations for the tournament but there were bad vibes inside the team, with a lot of arguments. Have you managed to address that? Are things better now?</strong></p>
                  <p>I don&#39;t think we have these issues right now. I think the main problem is a little bit of nerves, and then something goes wrong. But, you know, new coach, new structure, and we&#39;re trying to find our game as a team.</p>
<a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/43057/artfr0st-we-couldve-gone-really-deep-into-the-tournament-but-bad-vibes-affected-us-too-much">
                    <p><img alt="" src="https://img-cdn.hltv.org/gallerypicture/67UUgJMQn_Vjh63SlhZM0N.jpg?auto=compress&amp;ixlib=java-2.1.0&amp;m=%2Fm.png&amp;mw=107&amp;mx=20&amp;my=473&amp;q=75&amp;w=800&amp;s=c3ef402f5dc65cf90b1d2bccbabaf4ac" itemprop="image" loading="lazy"/></p>

                      <p>ArtFr0st: &#34;We could&#39;ve gone really deep into the tournament, but bad vibes affected us too much&#34;</p>
                    </div>
                  </a>
                  <p><strong>In Bucharest, Artfr0st also said that d1Ledez is a very talented player but that since he doesn&#39;t have an academy background, he still makes a lot of mistakes. Has he improved in that regard?</strong></p>
                  <p>He is studying new things. He was, I think, like a star player, and he&#39;s great at shooting. Right now, as I said, we are trying to build a new structure, and I think he&#39;s trying to think more and more. That&#39;s why maybe sometimes he can&#39;t kill a lot, but in the future it will be great for everyone.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>You&#39;re now going to face Gentle Mates in the semis. You lost to them in the IEM Rio closed qualifier last month. What is your opinion of them? Are you looking for revenge?</strong></p>
                  <p>Oh, of course. We also faced them in Bucharest in the 1-2 pool, they beat us and we were out of the tournament. So it&#39;s two matches, and now revenge. I don&#39;t want to think about revenge, but still, in my mind it should be. And of course, we will prepare, and now it&#39;s again a LAN match. So we will see what happens. Our team wants to win the tournament right now, because VRS points are really important, and there&#39;s not a lot of time until the Major invites.</p>
                  <p><strong>After this, you have Journey Spring in Stockholm, BCG Masters Championship in Bucharest, and Roman Imperium Cup VII here again. You are in a good position to make the Major. Is that the main goal now, after you missed Budapest?</strong></p>
                  <p>If we&#39;re talking about results, of course the Major is the main goal. But if we&#39;re talking about the game, like I said, the structure, the new coach, and trying to be a team. Like, a real team. I hope we get visas to go to every LAN you mentioned.</p>
                  <p><strong>When it comes to the new coach, what has changed in the team compared to before?</strong></p>
                  <p>The main thing is that he&#39;s trying to make it so every player can think and do something without my call. That&#39;s all.</p>
