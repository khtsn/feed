Those included disassembled AR-15-style guns, cocaine and ketamine, lingerie and seven-inch platform high heels — and bottles and bottles of baby oil.</p><p>Federal agents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/arts/music/diddy-sean-combs-home-raided.html" title="">descended on Mr. Combs’s homes</a>, one in Miami Beach, Fla., and another in Los Angeles, in March 2024, events that were partly captured on live television and made public the criminal investigation into the music mogul.</p><p>The prosecution detailed the Miami Beach raid on the eighth day of the trial in an attempt to illustrate their accusations that Mr. Combs ran a violent criminal enterprise that facilitated sex trafficking and drug violations, among other crimes.</p><p>The sex-related supplies are not themselves illegal, but prosecutors have described baby oil and a lubricant called Astroglide as frequent tools in voyeuristic sexual encounters between women and male prostitutes that they say amounted to sex trafficking. Casandra Ventura, who testified about participating in “hundreds” of the sex marathons known as “freak-offs,” said that Mr. Combs made specific requests about her appearance during those encounters and told her to apply and reapply copious amounts of oil to keep her skin “glistening.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. His lawyers have argued that the sexual encounters were fully consensual, and they deny the existence of any criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Gerard Gannon, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations who oversaw the Miami Beach search, testified that to gain access to Mr. Combs’s home — which is on a man-made island known for large celebrity estates — the government used an armored vehicle to break through the front gate.</p><p>“They deemed that was the quickest and safest option to be able to get onto the property,” Mr. Gannon testified.</p><p>At the time of the searches, Mr. Combs’s lawyers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/arts/music/diddy-sean-combs-raid-statement.html" title="">called them “a gross overuse of military-level force.”</a></p><p>Between 80 and 90 agents were involved in the Miami Beach search, Mr. Gannon said. Once inside, agents discovered parts from two AR-15-style guns with their serial numbers removed, as well as magazines with ammunition, inside a large closet of the home’s primary bedroom. They also found sex toys, condoms and boxes of stilettos. In one hallway closet, they found 25 bottles of baby oil and 31 bottles of lubricant. (Prosecutors have said that agents found more than 1,000 bottles of those substances during the searches of the two homes.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Gannon held up some of the evidence for the jury, including a Gucci bag found in the home that was found to have contained white powder that tested positive for cocaine and ketamine, along with pink MDMA tablets and different types of benzodiazepine pills. Ms. Ventura testified that drugs were a fixture of freak-offs.</p><p>As the special agent walked jurors through some of the drugs found in the bag, Mr. Combs, wearing a cream-colored sweater and gray slacks, yawned from the defendant’s chair.</p><p>On cross-examination, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, pointed out that the AR-15-style guns were found disassembled — and thus were inoperable — and asked the federal agent, Mr. Gannon, if he kept guns in his own home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bottles of baby oil and Astroglide lubricant that were found in Mr. Combs’s Miami Beach home.

She testified in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/arts/amber-heard-johnny-depp-settlement.html" title="">the civil case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard</a>, as well as criminal cases against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/arts/music/r-kelly-sentenced-federal-child-sex-crimes.html" title="">R. Kelly</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/nyregion/nxivm-cult-keith-raniere-sentenced.html" title="">Keith Raniere.</a></p><p>Prosecutors used Dr. Hughes’s testimony to add psychological context to why Ms. Ventura might have stayed with Mr. Combs on and off for 11 years despite what they said was rampant physical abuse of her and sexual coercion. Dr. Hughes said that victims often do not leave abusive relationships when their partner maintains financial or other types of control over them.</p><p>“If you don’t have access to tangible resources — money or an apartment — you are left with the feeling of, ‘Where am I going to go?’” testified Dr. Hughes, who said she had not interviewed Mr. Combs, Ms. Ventura or any of the other people the government has identified as victims.</p><p>During cross-examination, the defense pointed repeatedly to the fact that Dr. Hughes had not reviewed any evidence in the case. The defense also highlighted the history of her testimony in dozens of court cases, noting that she had never testified “in defense of a man accused of a sex crime.”</p><p>“That’s correct — I don’t evaluate offenders,” Dr. Hughes replied.</p><p>On Thursday, prosecutors are expected to call to the stand Kid Cudi, the rapper whose romance with Ms. Ventura is said to have sent Mr. Combs into a jealous, threat-filled rage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ms. Ventura, who is known as the singer Cassie, testified last week that after Mr. Combs discovered her relationship with Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, in 2011, Mr. Combs made a series of threats to her, including that Mr. Mescudi’s car would be “blown up” in his driveway.</p><p>Ms. Geragos said in the defense’s opening statement that Mr. Combs was “simply not involved” in the allegations of arson put forward by prosecutors.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/arts/music/diddy-trial-takeaways.html" title="">four days of searing testimony by Ms. Ventura</a> about a pattern of physical abuse and drug-fueled sex marathons, the government has lined up a series of witnesses they hope will help corroborate her account for jurors.</p><p>Several witnesses, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial-assistant-cassie-mother.html" title="">Ms. Ventura’s mother</a>, testified <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-trial.html" title="">to directly witnessing</a> Mr. Combs abusing her or to seeing the resulting bruising and swelling. Two men testified that they were paid to have sex with Ms. Ventura while Mr. Combs watched, describing for the jury the sexual choreography in hotel rooms that they said Mr. Combs directed.</p><p>The dispute between Mr. Combs and Ms. Ventura over her relationship with Mr. Mescudi has become one of the central events of the trial.</p><p>Ms. Ventura testified that Mr. Combs discovered evidence of the budding romance while looking through her phone during a freak-off. She said he lunged at her with a wine bottle opener between his fingers, and then threatened to release sexually explicit videos of her and “hurt” both her and Mr. Mescudi.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“He mentioned that when we were out of the country, that Scott’s car would be blown up,” Ms. Ventura testified. “He wanted his friends to be there to see it.”</p><p>Anusha Bayya<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julia Jacobs is an arts and culture reporter who often covers legal issues for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Ben Sisario, a reporter covering music and the music industry, has been writing for The Times for more than 20 years.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>21</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>At Combs Trial, Details of Raid That Found Guns and Baby Oil<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
