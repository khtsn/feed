Doug Burgum) and oddball (Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.) — reflecting the heterodox coalition that brought him back to power.</p><p>While never a traditional Republican, Mr. Trump, in a second term, looks likely to go further than in his first in dumping many traditional Republican policies. In particular, Mr. Trump seems willing, even eager, to embrace vice.</p><p>In his recent campaign, Mr. Trump embraced a strategy of <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/americas-cities-want-to-be-great-again" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social moderation</a>. Not only did he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/opinion/trump-abortion-pro-life.html" title="">loudly signal</a> his opposition to hard-line anti-abortion policies, but he also endorsed marijuana legalization in Florida and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/11/18/what-can-we-expect-from-trump-on-cannabis-reform/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was aligned</a> with the Biden administration’s move to give pot a less restrictive legal status. And he embraced the crypto craze, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-crypto-company-world-liberty-financial-is-a-disaster.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">starting</a> his own cryptocurrency company.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s moderation on pot, crypto — which some social conservatives see as closer to gambling than a serious investment — and other vices appears to have been part of a calculated effort to turn out young men, who, surveys <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggest</a>, helped propel him to victory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Pushing forward with liberalization in these areas could help establish vice voters as part of the new, post-Trump Republican coalition.</p><p>But it would also have dangerous social consequences — consequences that could help fuel an already growing backlash against both Mr. Trump and addictive, harmful goods of all kinds.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks indicate he could give these voters what they want. Take the issue of drugs. Mr. Kennedy, chosen to be the nation’s top health official, has <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/rfk-jr-could-advance-marijuana-and-psychedelics-reform-agenda-as-trumps-top-health-official/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported</a> federally legalizing marijuana. So has Matt Gaetz, Mr. Trump’s first, failed pick to be attorney general — and even with Mr. Gaetz’s name withdrawn, it signaled something striking, given that the attorney general can, after consulting with the health and human services secretary, reclassify controlled substances. That process could still run through Sheriff Chad Chronister, Mr. Trump’s pick to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, who <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/trump-dea-pick-a-florida-sheriff-who-supported-marijuana-decriminalization/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">celebrated</a> the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana in his county.</p><p>Mr. Gaetz has also expressed support for <a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org/public-statement/1252357/congressman-matt-gaetz-issues-statement-on-supreme-court-decision-in-murphy-v-ncaa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relaxing regulations</a> on sports gambling. Ms. Gabbard has said that she <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/tulsi-gabbard-says-country-should-move-to-legalize-drugs-like-cocaine-and-heroin/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wants to</a> decriminalize all drugs, though that’s less relevant to her designated role in the new administration as director of national intelligence. Howard Lutnick, proposed to head the Commerce Department, is also a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-crypto" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto fan</a>.</p><p>Mr. Trump himself is no stranger to vice. But he most likely played it up in the campaign in large part because young men <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/gen-z-voters-donald-trump-election-ab7b40b4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became</a> in 2024 an unexpected swing constituency. Historically a left-leaning group, they appear to have been, at least in part, drawn to Mr. Trump for his perceived machismo and repelled by what some saw as scolding feminism in the Democratic Party.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But most important, young men are disproportionately more likely to be consumers of the many legal or semilegal vices that have exploded over the past decade. A vast majority of both <a href="https://magazine.tcu.edu/summer-2024/crypto-cryptocurrency-demographics-political-science/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto owners</a> and <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/sports-betting-everywhere-how-do-americans-feel-about-it" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sports bettors</a> are male. Men are more likely than women to <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt42728/NSDUHDetailedTabs2022/NSDUHDetailedTabs2022/NSDUHDetTabsSect1pe2022.htm?s=male&amp;#tab1.28b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smoke marijuana</a> and <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt42728/NSDUHDetailedTabs2022/NSDUHDetailedTabs2022/NSDUHDetTabsSect2pe2022.htm?s=cigarette&amp;#tab2.11b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cigarettes</a>. These habits are common: In 2022 an estimated <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16519" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">17.7 million</a> Americans used marijuana daily or almost daily, and the <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/why-us-sports-betting-could-become-a-45-billion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sports gambling</a> and <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/community/united-states-of-crypto" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto</a> markets have expanded. It makes sense that some of these consumers would vote based on their habits.</p><p>Not only Mr. Trump but also Vice President Kamala Harris seemed to believe in the existence of the vice voter. When she proclaimed an “opportunity agenda” for Black men, it <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/agenda/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">included</a> protecting crypto assets and getting them jobs in a legal marijuana industry. In the waning days of the election, her campaign <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-courts-male-voters-fantasy-sports-sports-betting-video-game-pla-rcna176128" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">placed ads</a> on sports betting and video game websites.</p><p>That Mr. Trump appears to have won many of these voters cements an important part of the broader political realignment. Once the proud party of the Moral Majority and “Just say no,” the G.O.P. is now also trying to be the party of gamblers and gamers — of what the writer (and Times Opinion contributing writer) Matthew Walther, thinking of a popular sports website, <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/964006/rise-barstool-conservatives" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labeled</a> “Barstool conservatives.” This awkward coalition is reflected in a cabinet that combines Mr. Kennedy with Vice President-elect JD Vance, a <a href="https://www.wosu.org/politics-government/2024-08-09/jd-vances-stance-on-recreational-marijuana-is-at-odds-with-donald-trumps-view" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staunch opponent</a> of marijuana. And it may well be reflected in how the Trump administration treats vice.</p><p>This coalition is being shaped, though, just as the national mood on vice has started to sour. Amid rising reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/cannabis-marijuana-risks-addiction.html" title="">dangerous side effects</a>, a majority of Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648821/americans-views-marijuana-effects-worsen.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now say</a> pot is harmful to most of its users and society. <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/no-to-drugs-marijuana-mushrooms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Legalization</a> efforts failed in three states, including Florida, on Election Day. Voters in Massachusetts resoundingly defeated a psychedelics liberalization initiative there. Sports gambling legalization in Missouri is on a knife’s edge as a thin margin <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/sports-betting/missouri-sports-betting-question/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could send it</a> to a recount. And this year Oregon <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/kotek-signs-bill-overhaul-measure-110-recriminalize-drugs/283-041a6791-4441-4e30-a435-14707256544b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ended</a> its controversial drug decriminalization policy.</p><p>At the moment the Republican Party is embracing vice voters, Americans might be starting to understand the argument social reformers have long made: Vice is bad for society. An emerging body of research suggests that recreational marijuana legalization could cause enormous harms, including <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/84/3/1210/3091869" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worse academic performance</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095539592300049X" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more fatal car accidents</a>, <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/research-working-papers/economic-benefits-and-social-costs-of-legalizing-recreational-marijuana/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more homelessness</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350623002019" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more hospitalization</a>. Crypto speculation <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/year-crypto-broke-customers-investors-lost-millions/story?id=96662010" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has cost</a> everyday Americans millions of dollars. Sports gambling legalization has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/legal-sports-gambling-was-mistake/679925/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been linked to</a> increased rates of bankruptcy and ruined credit — particularly among young men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Nothing about this is surprising. Pot and gambling are addictive. A subset of users will use them compulsively, in spite of harm to themselves or others. Combine that quality with the free market, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html" title="">you get</a> addiction for profit, as big businesses not only make money off hooked consumers but also encourage them to do more of the thing that’s hurting them and others. Legal vice doesn’t just let individuals do what they want; it also creates industries — as Big Tobacco did in decades past — to sell people things that are bad for them.</p><p>If anything, the incorporation of vice voters into the Trump coalition could help accelerate the still nascent backlash. Democrats, historically the party more sympathetic to personal license, might look with fresh eyes at the public health harms of vice industries. Republican courting of vice voters might yield liberalization in the short run, but in the longer term, negative polarization could turn once-sympathetic opponents hostile.</p><p>A decade ago, no one would have guessed that a Republican president might be the one to legalize marijuana. Mr. Trump, though, might just get it done. That would have profoundly negative consequences for public health. But it would also confirm a political shift that could, eventually, see the nation finally turn back against vice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Charles Fain Lehman is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of City Journal.</p><p>Source photographs by Doug Mills/The New York Times.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
