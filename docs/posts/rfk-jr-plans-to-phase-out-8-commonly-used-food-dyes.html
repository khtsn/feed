    <h1>RFK Jr. Plans to Phase Out 8 Commonly Used Food Dyes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In his first attempt to significantly change the nation’s food supply, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, will direct food manufacturers to phase out eight petroleum-based food dyes that are found in hundreds of thousands of grocery-store staples, the department said on Monday.</p><p>The plan, expected to be described in detail at an event in Washington on Tuesday, targets dyes that used in cereals, sports drinks and a host of other foods. The Department of Health and Human Services has not outlined a regulatory path to enforce the changes, but wants them to be made by the end of 2026.</p><p>Health advocates have long criticized food dyes, citing a limited <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/press-release/report-links-synthetic-food-dyes-hyperactivity-and-other-neurobehavioral-effects-children" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">body of research</a> connecting them to hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in children. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates about 80 percent of the nation’s food supply, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/health/fda-red-dye-3-cancer-rats.html" title="">banned Red Dye No. 3</a> shortly before Mr. Trump took office, after studies connected it to cancer in laboratory animals. That followed a 2023 California law that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/health/california-ban-red-dye-food.html" title="">banned the dye</a>.</p><p>The eight dyes Mr. Kennedy is targeting are widely used within the United States, but products made for the European and Canadian markets — where companies are required to use warning labels if they add them — already use natural color substitutes. The secretary is expected to announce the approval of additional natural dyes at Tuesday’s event.</p></div></div>
