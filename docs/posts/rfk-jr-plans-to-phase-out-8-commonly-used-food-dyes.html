Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, will direct food manufacturers to phase out eight petroleum-based food dyes that are found in hundreds of thousands of grocery-store staples, the department said on Monday.</p><p>The plan, expected to be described in detail at an event in Washington on Tuesday, targets dyes that used in cereals, sports drinks and a host of other foods. The Department of Health and Human Services has not outlined a regulatory path to enforce the changes, but wants them to be made by the end of 2026.</p><p>Health advocates have long criticized food dyes, citing a limited <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/press-release/report-links-synthetic-food-dyes-hyperactivity-and-other-neurobehavioral-effects-children" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">body of research</a> connecting them to hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in children. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates about 80 percent of the nation’s food supply, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/health/fda-red-dye-3-cancer-rats.html" title="">banned Red Dye No. 3</a> shortly before Mr. Trump took office, after studies connected it to cancer in laboratory animals. That followed a 2023 California law that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/health/california-ban-red-dye-food.html" title="">banned the dye</a>.</p><p>The eight dyes Mr. Kennedy is targeting are widely used within the United States, but products made for the European and Canadian markets — where companies are required to use warning labels if they add them — already use natural color substitutes. The secretary is expected to announce the approval of additional natural dyes at Tuesday’s event.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Kennedy, long a champion of removing certain chemicals from the food supply, made food dyes an issue as soon as he was selected to head the health department, pointing out that the Canadian version of Froot Loops gets its bright colors from blueberries and carrots instead of Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and Blue No. 1.</p><p>In a March meeting in Washington, Mr. Kennedy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/health/rfk-jr-food-safety-artificial-dyes.html#:~:text=Kennedy%20Jr.%2C%20the%20health%20secretary,food%20system%20of%20artificial%20colorings." title="">warned top executives</a> from PepsiCo, W.K. Kellogg, General Mills and other large companies that eliminating food dyes was a top priority and that more changes would be coming.</p><p>Sarah Gallo, a senior vice president of product policy for the <a href="https://consumerbrandsassociation.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer Brands Association</a>, a lobbying group for the food and beverage industry, has previously cautioned that policies based on ideology and not science could undermine trust in food safety and “cause consumers, particularly those in vulnerable populations, to lose access to safe, nutrient-dense foods.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kim Severson is an Atlanta-based reporter who covers the nation’s food culture and contributes to <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/ourcooks/kim-severson/my-recipes">NYT Cooking</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>The Revolving Restaurant</strong>: Long considered a midcentury novelty, rotating restaurants are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/dining/revolving-restaurant.html">spinning back to life in cities across the United States</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Story of the Stroopwafel:</strong> Once considered “poor man cookies,” these Dutch sweets have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/dining/stroopwafel-cookie.html">found a global audience of loyal fans</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why Is Dining Alone So Difficult?</strong>: With solo reservations on the rise but many restaurants still restricting tables to two or more, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/dining/solo-dining-restaurants.html">solitary Americans often feel left out</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Eating in New York City</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Inspired Mexican American Food at a Queens Bar</strong>: Like the big cat that presides over this Ridgewood restaurant, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/dining/hellbender-nyc-restaurant-review.html">Hellbender knows how to stretch</a> — mixing late-night vibes with polished cooking.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Irish Pub Draws a Martini Crowd</strong>: T.J.
