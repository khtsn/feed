Many supporters of the bill said they believed that sex was determined at birth and that they worried about transgender women using women’s restrooms. Several speakers on both sides of the issue cited their Christian faith.</p><p>“I’m outraged that biological males have a legal right in Iowa to force themselves into my wife’s, daughters’ and granddaughters’ private spaces,” Chuck Hurley of The FAMiLY Leader, a group based in Iowa that describes itself as a Christian ministry to government, told a legislative committee on Thursday.</p><p>Minutes later, the Rev. Debbie Griffin, who pastors a church in Des Moines, urged lawmakers to reject the bill, warning that it “would endanger people who are already vulnerable to bullying and discrimination.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>On the federal level, the Supreme Court ruled several years ago that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protected gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination.
