Advocates for L.G.B.T.Q. rights said that Iowa would become the first state to remove such broad and explicit protections for trans people if the Republican-backed measure was signed into law.</p><p>The bill, which now goes to the desk of the Republican governor, passed 18 years after the state, then led by Democrats, enshrined those discrimination protections into Iowa code. </p><p>The debate this week in Des Moines, where protesters and Democrats tried without success this week to persuade Republican lawmakers to reconsider, reflected how much the discourse over transgender issues has shifted in the country, and how much Iowa has changed.</p><p>“The purpose of this bill, the purpose of every anti-trans bill, is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,” said State Representative Aime Wichtendahl, a Democrat who is transgender.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But Republicans said they were concerned that maintaining civil rights protections for gender identity would make other state laws — like those restricting gender-transition treatments for minors and sports participation by transgender women — vulnerable to legal challenges.</p><p>“All of these common-sense policies are at risk so long as gender identity remains in the Iowa civil rights code,” State Representative Steven Holt, a Republican supporter of the bill, said on the House floor.</p><p>The passage of the Iowa legislation comes as the Trump administration has tried to limit official recognition of transgender identity.</p><p>The administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/seattle-judge-trump-trans-youth-hospitals.html" title="">sought to end funding</a> for hospitals that provide gender-transition treatments to minors, to bar transgender women and girls from competing in women’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/trump-order-transgender-athletes-womens-sports.html" title="">sports</a>, to bar openly transgender people from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-transgender-troops.html" title="">serving in the military</a>, to house transgender women in federal prisons with men, and to no longer reflect the gender identities of transgender people on passports.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The bill in Iowa defines sex based on a person’s anatomy at birth and removes gender identity from a list of protected groups that employers, businesses and landlords may not discriminate against. The bill leaves in place discrimination protections for gay and lesbian people, which were passed as part of the same measure as the protections for gender identity.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Iowa House floor in 2023.

Many supporters of the bill said they believed that sex was determined at birth and that they worried about transgender women using women’s restrooms. Several speakers on both sides of the issue cited their Christian faith.</p><p>“I’m outraged that biological males have a legal right in Iowa to force themselves into my wife’s, daughters’ and granddaughters’ private spaces,” Chuck Hurley of The FAMiLY Leader, a group based in Iowa that describes itself as a Christian ministry to government, told a legislative committee on Thursday.</p><p>Minutes later, the Rev. Debbie Griffin, who pastors a church in Des Moines, urged lawmakers to reject the bill, warning that it “would endanger people who are already vulnerable to bullying and discrimination.”</p><p>On the federal level, the Supreme Court ruled several years ago that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protected gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination. Efforts by Democrats in Congress to expand the scope of those protections beyond the workplace have failed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>More than 20 states, most of them led by Democrats, have explicit employment discrimination protections for transgender people, according to information compiled by the Movement Advancement Project, a think tank that supports L.G.B.T.Q. rights.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 2022, Gov.

Kim Reynolds, a Republican did not immediately respond to questions on Thursday about whether she had a position on the legislation or planned to sign it. She has previously signed laws that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/22/politics/iowa-gender-affirming-care-ban/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned gender-transition treatments</a> for minors and that kept transgender girls and women from competing in <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/03/trans-transgender-girls-banned-womens-sports-kim-reynolds-lgbtq-iowa-signs-bill/9349887002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">women’s sports</a>.</p><p>Those measures have been part of a broader push by Iowa Republicans into social issues that voters have so far rewarded at the ballot box. In recent years, Ms. Reynolds and legislative Republicans have passed laws to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/us/iowa-republicans-special-session.html" title="">restrict abortion</a>, ban <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/us/iowa-book-ban-blocked.html" title="">school library books</a> deemed sexually explicit and allow for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/us/iowa-deportation-bill-immigration.html" title="">state-level immigration enforcement</a>.</p><p>Democrats have struggled to push back. Former President Barack Obama carried Iowa twice, but Republicans have seen their support surge since President Trump became the party’s leader. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-iowa.html" title="">Mr. Trump carried Iowa</a> last year by about 13 percentage points, winning 94 of its 99 counties, and Republicans retained large state legislative majorities.
