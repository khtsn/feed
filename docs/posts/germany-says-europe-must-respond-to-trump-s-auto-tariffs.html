    <h1>Germany Says Europe Must Respond to Trump’s Auto Tariffs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Automakers have the choice of absorbing the cost of the tariffs or passing them on to consumers, the analysts noted. Prices could rise up to $12,000 per car, and “the resulting inflation could pressure the Trump administration into backing down,” they wrote.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s tariffs are hitting the European auto industry at a time when it is facing a transformation and increased international competition, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said in a statement.</p><p>“European automakers have been investing in the U.S. for decades, creating jobs, fostering economic growth in local communities, and generating massive tax revenue for the U.S. government,” said the group’s director general, Sigrid de Vries. “We urge President Trump to consider the negative impact of tariffs not only on global automakers but on U.S. domestic manufacturing as well.”</p><p>Hildegard Müller, the president of Germany’s main lobby group for the automobile industry, VDA, called the tariffs “a fatal signal for free and rules-based trade.”</p><p>The tariffs “represent a considerable burden for both companies and the closely interwoven global supply chains of the automotive industry — with negative consequences for consumers in particular, including in North America,” Ms. Müller said in a statement.</p><p>“The risk of a global trade war, with negative consequences for the world economy and growth, prosperity, jobs and consumer prices, is very high,” she added.</p><p>Melissa Eddy<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
