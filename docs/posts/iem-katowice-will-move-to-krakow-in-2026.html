Paul Walczak expressed “so much shame” for his tax fraud. Daniel Rodriguez wrote a letter to “apologize from the heart” to a police officer he assaulted with a stun gun.</p><p>But when they or their allies pushed for pardons from President Trump, they argued that they — like him — had been unfairly targeted by prosecutors because of their politics.</p><p>It is an argument that has resonated with Mr. Trump, who issued full and unconditional pardons to all three of the men, as well as hundreds of other supporters convicted of an array of crimes.</p><p>About four months into his second stint in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/politics/trump-pardons-clemency.html" title="">redefined the exercise of presidential clemency</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced a raft of pardons, which wipe away convictions, and commutations, which cut sentences short. Not all had obvious political ties. Recipients included a rapper who was sentenced to nearly two years in prison in a federal gun case and the co-founder of a Chicago gang who was serving multiple life sentences for crimes including murder.</p><p>But several beneficiaries had ties to Mr. Trump or to conservative groups, including Michael G. Grimm, a former Republican representative from Staten Island who served seven months in prison <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/nyregion/rep-michael-grimm-pleads-guilty-to-tax-fraud.html" title="">for tax fraud a decade ago</a>.</p><p>The president has focused on rewarding allies and supporters who make arguments that echo his own claims that he was prosecuted by a Justice Department that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/us/politics/trump-justice-system-weaponized.html" title="">weaponized for political ends</a> by the administration of his predecessor, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>Mr. Trump has largely forsaken a more formal Justice Department process intended to identify and vet deserving clemency applicants who have served their time and expressed remorse.</p><p>His approach has created an incentive for pardon seekers, or their allies, to demonstrate their fealty to him and to accuse the Biden Justice Department of singling them out because of that support. And it has created a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/us/politics/trump-pardons.html" title="">cottage industry of clemency lobbyists and lawyers</a> offering to help shape such appeals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It worked in the case of Mr. Kelsey, a former Republican state senator from Tennessee, who had pleaded guilty in 2022 to illegally funneling money to his failed campaign for Congress in 2016. He tried unsuccessfully to withdraw the plea, then after Mr. Trump was elected, he filed a pardon application with the White House, claiming that prosecutors had gone after him to get to a close ally of Mr. Trump, according to a person familiar with the application.</p><p>Mr. Kelsey reported to prison in February for a 21-month sentence, but was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/tennessee-senator-kelsey-trump-pardon.html" title="">pardoned by Mr. Trump</a> about two weeks later.</p><p>In <a href="https://tennesseestar.com/commentary/commentary-trumps-pardon-rescued-me-from-a-weaponized-justice-system/admin/2025/05/28/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an essay published on Wednesday</a>, Mr. Kelsey claimed that “the Biden administration waged unprecedented lawfare against President Trump” and that “it also waged lawfare against Trump supporters, including me.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brian Kelsey, a former Tennessee state senator, pleaded guilty in 2022 to illegally funneling money to his failed campaign for Congress in 2016.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Humphrey/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. Walczak, a former nursing home executive who last year pleaded guilty to tax offenses, sounded similar notes in his pardon application.

Willis, the Georgia state prosecutor who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/14/us/trump-indictment-georgia-election" title="">charged Mr. Trump in 2023</a> in connection with his efforts to cling to power after the 2020 election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On Monday, in announcing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/politics/trump-scott-jenkins-pardon-virginia-sheriff.html" title="">pardon for a​ former Virginia county sheriff</a> who was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for bribery, Mr. Trump declared that the sheriff was “a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn’t deserve to spend a single day in jail.”</p><p>The former sheriff, Scott Jenkins, is a prominent local supporter for Mr. Trump.</p><p>After the pardon was announced, Ed Martin, a close Trump ally who was recently appointed as the Justice Department’s pardon attorney, signaled that there would be more pardons coming for Trump supporters.</p><p>“No MAGA left behind,” he wrote on <a href="https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1927092000848855360" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a>, adding “<a href="https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1927821985859482038" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Freedom for Captives!</a>” after a ceremonial swearing-in for his new position on Wednesday.</p><p>The appointment of Mr. Martin, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/ed-martin-us-attorneys-office-trump.html" title="">supported the defenses of Capitol rioters</a> and has emerged as a leading advocate for using the power of the Justice Department to punish Mr. Trump’s foes, underscores the administration’s political approach to clemency.</p><p>The first political appointee to serve as pardon attorney in recent memory, Mr. Martin stepped into the role after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/justice-department-mel-gibson.html" title="">firing of a career Justice Department official</a> who had refused to recommend the restoration of gun rights for the actor Mel Gibson, a prominent Trump supporter. (Mr. Gibson had his gun rights restored soon thereafter.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Martin had previously been tapped as the head of the powerful U.S. attorney’s office in Washington. His <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/ed-martin-justice-department-republicans.html" title="">nomination was withdrawn</a> amid rising concerns that he was using the office to advance Mr. Trump’s political causes and target his enemies, including by seeking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-prosecutor-biden-pardons.html" title="">undermine the pardons that Mr. Biden had issued</a> to his family members and others during his final days in office.</p><p>Mr. Martin also heads a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/justice-department-weaponization-group.html" title="">Weaponization Working Group</a>” inside the Justice Department that is seen as pursuing Mr. Trump’s grievances with the Biden administration’s investigations into him and his supporters.</p><p>Neil McCabe, a senior adviser to Mr. Martin, cast the positions as two sides of the same coin.</p><p>“As weaponization czar, he is going to find out what happened and hold people accountable,” Mr. McCabe said. “But then as pardon attorney, he can unwind the damage.”</p><p>Alan Feuer<!-- --> and <!-- -->Neil Vigdor<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth P.
