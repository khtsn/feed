                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid613919228">Passion UA</a> have announced the addition of sniper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19869/try" data-tooltip-id="uid509195885">Santino <span>&#34;⁠try⁠&#34;</span> Rigal</a> from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/9455/imperial" data-tooltip-id="uid1415309668">Imperial</a> to take over the AWPing duties on the team. Whilst <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid613919228">Passion UA</a> have not stated who will step back from the starting lineup, it will presumably be previous AWPer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/12840/hallzerk" data-tooltip-id="uid1742207099">Håkon <span>&#34;⁠hallzerk⁠&#34;</span> Fjærli</a>.</p>
                  <p>The news comes amidst a largely disappointing start to the year for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid613919228">Passion UA</a> who failed to win a series in either of their two international LAN outings thus far, BLAST Bounty Season 1 and IEM Katowice Stage 1.</p>

                  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19869/try" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid509195885">try</a> arrives having long been touted as one of the most talented AWPers hailing from the South American region, serving as one of the best-rated players on each team he has been a part of during his career.</p>
                  <p>The 21-year-old spent the last 18 months turning out for Brazilian side <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/9455/imperial" data-tooltip-id="uid1415309668">Imperial</a>, with whom he has attended three Majors and produced multiple top placings in regional competitions, like Circuito FERJEE de Esports 2025 and FiReLEAGUE Buenos Aires 2025. Throughout his tenure <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19869/try" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid509195885">try</a> has been by far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/9455/imperial" data-tooltip-id="uid1415309668">Imperial</a>&#39;s top-rated player, posting a 1.19 average rating.</p>
                  <p>The team largely struggled to make headway in international competition, however, barring a surprise run to Stage 3 of the last Major, StarLadder Budapest Major. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19869/try" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid509195885">try</a> was a pillar of his team&#39;s success in Hungary, and the only player to acquit himself well individually against the stiffer competition in Stage 3.</p>
                  <p>It is expected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19869/try" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid509195885">try</a> will replace <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/12840/hallzerk" rel="nofollow" data-tooltip-id="uid1742207099">hallzerk</a>, who had served as a member of the core of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5005/complexity" data-tooltip-id="uid1918061910">Complexity</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid613919228">Passion UA</a> across three-and-a-half years. The Norwegian was regularly one of the better-rated players during his tenure in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/5005/complexity" data-tooltip-id="uid1918061910">Complexity</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/team/12426/passion-ua" data-tooltip-id="uid613919228">Passion UA</a>, but regularly saw his level dip significantly when playing against teams higher up the world ranking.</p>
