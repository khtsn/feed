She promised to fight big corporations and bring down the costs of food, housing and raising children. A centerpiece of her economic pitch <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/business/economy/kamala-harris-inflation-price-gouging.html" title="">is a new federal ban on price gouging on groceries</a>.</p><p>Her newly unveiled economic plan mostly builds on policies embraced by President Biden, and wasn’t super-detailed, outside of a few policies.</p><p>The economy, and especially inflation, remain a top concern among voters, and polls suggest Donald Trump holds an edge on the issue. But Harris’s speech demonstrated her ease at explaining policy matters, especially compared to President Biden.</p><p>Harris delivered the speech in North Carolina, a state that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-north-carolina.html" title="">Democrats believe she could potentially win</a>, despite it not voting for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2008.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pokrovsk is one of several cities that protect the part of Donetsk that is still held by Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tyler Hicks/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-36ee67be">Russia closed in on a key city in eastern Ukraine</h2><p>Russian troops are advancing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-pokrovsk-kursk.html" title="">toward the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk</a>, according to combat footage and satellite images. The push brought Russia a step closer to its goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region. It also cast doubt on Ukraine’s hopes that its incursion into Russian territory would prompt Moscow to scale back its attacks elsewhere on the battlefield.</p><p>Ukraine’s military push into Russia, which began 11 days ago, has continued. Its troops have advanced through Russian villages with little resistance, rattling Moscow.</p><p>It’s not clear whether the Ukrainians will push farther into Russia, dig in, or pull back and return to the front line. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-incursion.html" title="">There are arguments for each option</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haitham Imad/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-484cb2f6">Mediators raced to bridge gaps between Israel and Hamas</h2><p>High-level negotiations to halt the war in Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/16/world/israel-iran-hamas-gaza-war" title="">ended today without a breakthrough</a>. But mediators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar said they would continue trying to resolve remaining disagreements between Israel and Hamas at talks next week in Cairo.</p><p>U.S. officials hope that movement in the negotiations will blunt or prevent a widely anticipated Iranian-led retaliation against Israel for the killing of senior leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. For now, Iran is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/world/middleeast/iran-israel-hamas-cease-fire.html?smid=url-share" title="">expected to delay its reprisal</a> to allow the cease-fire talks to continue.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kathleen Fu</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The actor Blake Lively at a London screening of “It Ends With Us.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Justin Tallis/AFP — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-7ba77297">A surprisingly buzzy summer flick</h2><p>“It Ends With Us,” a romantic drama based on a best-selling novel and starring Blake Lively, has exceeded expectations at the box office.

They include a reported rift between Lively and Justin Baldoni, her co-star and director, and criticism of its marketing campaign for downplaying the issue of domestic violence, a central theme in the film. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/movies/it-ends-with-us-controversy-blake-lively-justin-baldoni.html" title="">Here’s what we know about the drama</a>.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Illustration by Nicolás Ortega; Photograph by Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-50ea6a1">Life is more fun with close friendships</h2><p>Two weeks ago, my colleague Jancee Dunn brought you tips on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/well/live/friends-community-connections.html" title="">how to make friends</a> and explored the health benefits of friendships.

The game, which trains users to pay attention for sustained periods, is also a medical device approved by the F.D.A. to help treat A.D.H.D. symptoms.</p><p>That might sound too good to be true. So my colleague Thom Dunn at Wirecutter tested it out. He found that it helped improve some of his A.D.H.D. symptoms.
