    <h1>Deporting Americans?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Over the past week, President Trump has shown us what mass deportations look like.</p><p>His administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/us/politics/us-citizen-children-deported.html" title="">sent three American children</a> from two different families to Honduras along with their undocumented mothers on Friday. One of the kids, a 4-year-old boy, is in the fourth stage of a rare form of cancer.</p><p>As Trump ramps up deportations, more sympathetic cases like these are likely to pop up. Trump wants to deport <em>all</em> undocumented immigrants. Some of them are genuine criminals who have done awful things while staying in the United States illegally. Most of them are not. They are people who came to this country looking for work or fleeing horrible conditions back home. They might be pregnant, as one of the deported moms is, or ill or parents of U.S. citizens. Still, they are undocumented, so they’re on Trump’s deportation list.</p><p>The administration says that it has a mandate to carry out campaign promises and restore law and order. Most Americans, however, believe that only some unauthorized migrants should be deported, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2025/03/26/americans-views-of-deportations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polling suggests</a>.</p><p>In the cases of the three American children, the courts may get a say.</p><h2 id="link-61e9186c">Avoiding separation</h2><p>Officials detained the families during routine check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The authorities took the mothers and their children — 2, 4 and 7 years old — hours away from the site of their appointments in New Orleans, the families’ lawyers said. Within days, they were gone. The lawyers couldn’t reach the mothers until after they arrived in Honduras.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A Trump-appointed federal judge, Terry Doughty, issued a brief order in the case of the 2-year-old on Friday, setting a hearing to get more information. The 2-year-old’s father reportedly said that he wanted his daughter to remain in the United States. Doughty said that he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”</p><p>The administration insists that it didn’t deport U.S. citizens. Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, said that officials gave the mother of the 2-year-old a choice to leave her child in the United States or take the girl to Honduras. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the kids, but not the mom, could come back if their father or someone else took them.</p><p>The administration is seemingly trying to avoid the kinds of family separations that drew widespread criticism during Trump’s first term, but it also doesn’t want to show mercy to unauthorized migrants. It criticizes migrants for using birthright citizenship to enter the United States and “anchor” themselves through a child born here. “Having a U.S. citizen child after you enter this country illegally is not a get-out-of-jail-free card,” Homan said.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>Trump signed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-immigration.html" title="">new executive orders</a> related to his immigration crackdown, including one targeting “sanctuary cities.”</p></li><li><p>Immigrant rights advocates sued the Trump administration, challenging a policy that allows ICE agents to operate in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/us/politics/trump-immigration-churches-schools.html" title="">schools and churches</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Srinagar, India.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yawar Nazir/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-79bea586">Border battle</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anupreeta-das"><img alt="Anupreeta Das" title="Anupreeta Das" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/22/reader-center/author-anupreeta-das/author-anupreeta-das-thumbLarge.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p>After a terrorist attack last week, India has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/asia/kashmir-attack-india-pakistan.html?searchResultPosition=22" title="">unleashed a salvo of punitive measures</a> against Pakistan. Most important, it pulled out of a water-sharing treaty. Pakistan quickly retaliated, closing off airspace to India.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>These two nuclear-armed countries are often at loggerheads, and it’s usually because of Kashmir, a picturesque Himalayan region that both claim but neither fully controls. They’ve fought three wars over the territory, and low-grade hostility simmers in perpetuity.</p><p>Things got much worse recently, though, when the terrorist attack killed 26 people, most of them tourists, in the Indian-administered part of Kashmir on April 22. I wrote about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/asia/kashmir-pahalgam-attack-victims.html" title="">what happened that day</a>. India hasn’t blamed any group for the attack yet, but it implies that the perpetrators were linked to Pakistan. Experts believe that Pakistan has long sponsored terrorism in Kashmir. Pakistan denies any role in the attack.</p><p>In addition to the water and airspace moves, both nations canceled visas for each other’s citizens. That separated family members at the border. (The Times told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/asia/india-pakistan-visas-kashmir.html" title="">some of their stories here</a>.) And Pakistan suspended its participation in the agreement that divides up Kashmir.</p><p>Analysts worry things could get much worse. The attack last week caught the Indian government off guard, exposing a security and intelligence lapse. That’s embarrassing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government in 2019 took control of Kashmir, which had been guaranteed autonomy in the Indian Constitution. Now domestic pressure could push the Indian government to go further, according to analysts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>India’s last major conflict with Pakistan happened in 2019, when a Pakistani militant used a van filled with explosives as a suicide weapon and killed at least 40 troops in Indian-controlled Kashmir. In response, India carried out airstrikes against Pakistan. Back then, the Trump administration worked to moderate tensions. This time, Trump said, “They’ll get it figured out.”</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/world/asia/kashmir-terrorist-attack-explainer.html" title="">what you need to know about Kashmir</a>.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-2f8296a1">Canadian Election</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mark Carney</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cole Burston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>Mark Carney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/28/world/canada-election/heres-the-latest?smid=url-share" title="">won a new term</a> as Canada’s prime minister.

In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/crosswords/kids-crossword.html" title="">an interview with Christina Iverson</a>, a Times puzzle editor, they explained:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Kaela:</strong> Our mom and dad were doing it, so I wanted to do it, too.</p><p><strong>Nate:</strong> Same. And I like solving puzzles.</p></blockquote><p>The puzzle is a bit more direct and simple than a typical Times puzzle, so it’s a great entry point for crossword-curious adults. But it will resonate with kid solvers, with clues that evoke the best of childhood (“‘I think ___, I think ___, I think ___’ — words repeated in ‘The Little Engine that Could’”) and the worst (“Finish your dinner, ___ you may have dessert”).</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/paid/kids-crossword" title="">Play their crossword here</a> and get our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/gameplay" title="">Gameplay newsletter delivered to your inbox</a>.</p><p>Today’s Games</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anupreeta Das covers India and South Asia for The Times.
