Within days, NYU Langone, a leading New York City hospital, began canceling appointments for some children, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/nyregion/nyu-langone-hospital-trans-care-youth.html" title="">two families who spoke to The New York Times</a>.</p><p>But the attorney general’s letter warns hospitals that they may risk violating anti-discrimination laws in New York by denying care to pediatric transgender patients.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,” the letter states. It went on, “Electing to refuse services to a class of individuals based on their protected status, such as withholding the availability of services from transgender individuals based on their gender identity or their diagnosis of gender dysphoria, while offering such services to cisgender individuals, is discrimination under New York law.”</p><p>NYU Langone has made no announcement about the canceled appointments. A hospital spokesman said he had no immediate comment on the letter.</p><p>On Monday evening, several hundred people gathered in a park near NYU Langone’s Tisch Hospital in Manhattan before marching to the hospital’s main entrance to protest the cancellations, some carrying signs with messages like “NYU Langone: Whose side are you on?” or waving transgender pride flags.</p><p>Speakers at the rally, organized by local chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America, included Tiffany Cabán, a City Council member, and Cynthia Nixon, a former candidate for governor whose transgender son received treatment at NYU Langone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Leaving transgender patients without care is “the definition of harm,” Ms. Cabán said to the crowd.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators supporting gender-affirming care for minors marched from St. Vartan Park to the NYU Langone hospital in Manhattan on Monday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers prevented protesters from reaching the NYU Langone hospital on Monday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The executive order last week left many families uncertain about whether their transgender children would be able to receive the medical care and procedures they had anticipated. In interviews, two different families said their 12-year-olds had been scheduled for a procedure in which a small device that would release Supprelin LA, a puberty-blocking medication, would be implanted in the upper arm. But those appointments were abruptly canceled following the executive order.</p><p>In interviews, several parents with transgender children expressed dismay not only at the executive order but also that hospitals in New York City failed to act as bulwarks. They said they had hoped that transgender children in New York would be somewhat insulated from changes in federal policy.</p><p>Across the country, more than two dozen states have put restrictions or bans on gender-affirming care for children, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-trans-gender-affirming-care.html" title="">according to the Human Rights Campaign</a>. But in New York, some hospitals not only had thriving practices providing gender-affirming care to transgender children but also advertised <a href="https://nyulangone.org/locations/transgender-youth-health-program" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it prominently online</a>.</p><p>The executive order, however, showed just how much leverage the federal government has over hospitals. “It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another,” the order began. The order threatened to cut federal research funding to force hospitals to stop “the chemical and surgical mutilation of children,” which is how the order describes “gender-affirming care” for young people.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The financial implications are enormous, even for a hospital system as prominent as NYU Langone Health. In one recent year, NYU Langone Health and its researchers at N.Y.U.’s medical school <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received $815 million in awards</a> from the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>The executive order also instructed the federal government to examine whether Medicare or Medicaid could be used to force hospitals to comply.</p><p>In a recent 12-month period, NYU Langone made more than $9 billion from patient care. Nearly half that amount — $4.4 billion — was paid through government insurance programs.</p><p>The executive order takes specific aim at prescribing puberty blockers, hormone treatment and various surgical procedures for children who experience gender dysphoria, the condition that describes a patient’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/health/puberty-blockers-transgender.html" title="">distress over the mismatch</a> between gender identity and sex at birth.</p><p>Broader questions about medical treatment for young people who are seeking to transition have been the subject of debate in the United States and Europe.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Europe there has been a pronounced shift that has made some gender-affirming treatments less available to children. Britain <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/world/europe/uk-bans-puberty-blockers-under-18.html#:~:text=Britain%20is%20to%20ban%20indefinitely,in%20place%20earlier%20this%20year." title="">recently banned the use of puberty blockers</a> in children under 18 for gender dysphoria, outside of clinical trials.</p><p>Puberty blockers have been approved by the F.D.A. for treatment of unusually early onset of puberty, and ailments including prostate cancer and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/18/well/live/endometriosis-symptoms-treatment.html" title="">endometriosis</a>. Their use for children with gender dysphoria is considered off-label, although off-label prescriptions of medication are common.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of gender affirming care, including parents and their children, rallied at St. Vartan Park in Manhattan on Monday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Graham Dickie/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The precise number of children on puberty blockers for gender dysphoria in New York is not clear.</p><p>A state senator, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, said that restricting gender-affirming care to young people posed a danger to their health.</p><p>“Simply put, this decision could put lives at risk,” the state senator, who represents part of Manhattan, said in a statement. “It is imperative that all New Yorkers, including those under the age of 19, are able to receive necessary and life-preserving gender-affirming care to which they are legally entitled to in the State of New York.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Among the attendees at the rally in Manhattan on Monday, many were parents with children who are transgender or nonbinary. Eric Davenport, who traveled from Upper Manhattan with his 12-year-old, Alex, who identifies as gender-fluid, said his family had begun seeking out doctors to discuss whether hormone therapy might be appropriate for Alex. Now, they are unsure of their options.</p><p>“This is the last thing that we need to be worried about,” he said, “a political system attacking our family.”</p><p>Wesley Parnell<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joseph Goldstein covers health care in New York for The Times, following years of criminal justice and police reporting.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joseph-goldstein">More about Joseph Goldstein</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>19</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>James Tells  Hospitals To Maintain   Trans Care<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/new-york-university-langone-medical-center">New York University Langone Medical Center</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>​​A Prosecutor’s ‘Sovereign’ Status: </strong>If the Southern District of New York’s interim U.S. attorney agrees to drop the prosecution of Mayor Eric Adams, the decision could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/nyregion/eric-adams-charges-southern-district.html">threaten the reputation of a famously independent office</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>​​A Survivor’s Story: </strong>Joseph Lynskey was waiting for the subway in Manhattan when he was pushed in front of a train, but somehow he survived. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/nyregion/new-york-subway-shove-survivor.html">The random act of violence has transformed his life</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>​​Lonely at the Top: </strong>In New York City, private restaurants in luxury towers are a popular amenity.
