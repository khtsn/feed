Trump</a>. Those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/media/kamala-harris-press-interviews.html" title="">appearances tend to be tightly scripted</a>, leaving little room for error.</p><p>Ms. Harris’s remarks largely stick close to the facts, but her comments sometimes omit context that may give voters a different impression.</p><p>Here’s a look.</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“Donald Trump’s plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year.”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Ms. Harris was referring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-imports.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s proposals to place a 10 to 20 percent tariff</a> on most imports, and a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods.</p><p><a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/former-president-trump-proposes-an-up-to-3900-tax-increase-for-a-typical-family/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund</a>, a liberal think tank, found that tariffs at those levels would cost the average family $3,900 annually, as Ms. Harris said.</p><p>Estimates from other researchers vary. And Mr. Trump has also suggested that he would replace income taxes with tariffs to minimize their impact, though tax policy experts say this is impossible.</p><p>The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that the proposals would <a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/2024/why-trumps-tariff-proposals-would-harm-working-americans" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost the average middle-class household $1,700 annually</a>. The institute <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/can-trump-replace-income-taxes-tariffs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has also noted</a> that for tariffs to replace income tax, the tariffs would have to be implausibly high because Mr. Trump’s proposal would generate about $225 billion annually in revenue, compared with the $2 trillion that income taxes generate.</p><p>The Tax Policy Center <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tpc-trump-tariffs-would-raise-household-taxes-and-slow-imports" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated the costs at $320 more annually</a> for the lowest-income households and $1,350 more for middle-class households.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The right-leaning American Action Forum <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/trumps-10-percent-tariffs-projected-impacts-on-u-s-households-and-allies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pinned the cost of the broad tariff</a> at $1,700 to $2,350 annually, and the Chinese-specific ones at $1,950.</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on Day 1 if re-elected.”</em></p><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Ms. Harris was referring to comments Mr. Trump made on Fox News. He later said he was joking, as he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-claims-trump-joking-ordered-covid-testing/story?id=71389171" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often</a> <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/860891/trump-says-just-joking-when-called-himself-chosen" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">does</a> after making a controversial statement. Given the ambiguity and contradictory nature of his comments, readers can decide for themselves what to make of Mr. Trump’s remarks.</p><p>During a <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-town-hall-with-hannity-12-5-23-transcript" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">December town hall on Fox News</a>, the host Sean Hannity gave Mr. Trump a chance to clarify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/trump-2024-president.html" title="">his remarks</a> vowing “retribution” during his second term.</p><p>“Under no circumstances, you are promising America tonight, you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody,” Mr. Hannity said.</p><p>“Except for Day 1,” Mr. Trump responded, adding, “I want to close the border and I want to drill, drill, drill.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>When Mr. Hannity pointed out that was not retribution, Mr. Trump said: “We love this guy. He says you’re not going to be a dictator, are you? I said, no, no, no. Other than Day 1. We’re closing the border and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator. OK?”</p><p>Pressed again on Fox News in January about his remarks, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0TfaIpr9s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repeated his comment</a> that he would be a dictator for one day to close the border and to “drill, baby, drill” and “after that, I’m not going to be a dictator.”</p><p>In February, Mr. Trump <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCillizza/status/1754584637584642427" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Fox News</a> that his comment was “in jest” and that he was “having fun” with Mr. Hannity, noting that he had said he would be a dictator “for one day,” not from the first day on.</p><p>“That was said sarcastically. That was meant as a joke,” he <a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">again told Time magazine in April</a>.</p><p>When the magazine noted that some voters may see language like that as contradictory to democratic values, Mr. Trump said the comment was similar to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/trump-russia-clinton-emails.html" title="">his remark in July 2016 inviting Russia to hack Hillary Clinton</a>, because “everybody knows that was said sarcastically.”</p><p>What Was Said</p><p><em>“And be sure if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state.”</em></p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>This needs context. </strong>Mr. Trump has in the past supported a nationwide ban on abortion, but his recent statements have been contradictory or vague or signaled opposition.</p><p>In 2018, his administration supported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/us/politics/senate-abortion-ban-20-weeks.html" title="">a failed bill</a> to ban most abortions in the country after 20 weeks of pregnancy. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump <a href="https://sbaprolife.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-Letter-on-ProLife-Coalition.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said he would sign an earlier version of that bill</a>.</p><p>But in 2024, Mr. Trump’s position has been less clear. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/us/politics/trump-abortion-ban.html" title="">The New York Times reported in February</a> that Mr. Trump had privately supported a 16-week national ban.</p><p>He said during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/us/politics/trump-15-week-federal-abortion-ban.html" title="">a March radio interview</a> that “people are agreeing on 15,” but added that abortion should be a state issue.</p><p>But pressed by Time magazine on the issue, Mr. Trump did not commit to vetoing a bill if it contained a national abortion, but said that “you don’t need a federal ban” and that “it’s not going to happen” because it would never muster the 60 votes needed in the Senate.</p><p>In April, asked by reporters whether he would sign a federal ban, <a href="https://x.com/LaleeIbssa/status/1778096064853168414" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said no</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/us/politics/trump-abortion-gop.html" title="">The Times reported</a> that the Republican Party softened its position on abortion in its 2024 platform at Mr. Trump’s behest, and unlike the <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2016-republican-party-platform" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/resolution-regarding-the-republican-party-platform" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2020</a> platforms, it does not specifically call for a federal ban on abortions after 20 weeks. Some legal scholars <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/13/national-abortion-ban-hidden-in-plain-sight-in-revised-rnc-agenda-legal-experts-say/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have argued</a>, though, that this year’s platform advances a legal theory that would, in effect, ban abortion nationally.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Linda Qiu is a reporter who specializes in fact-checking statements made by politicians and public figures.
