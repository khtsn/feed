    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mayor Eric Adams of New York has chosen Kaz Daughtry, a deputy police commissioner known for his combative social media presence and close relationship with the mayor, to be deputy mayor for public safety, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Deputy Commissioner Daughtry will replace Chauncey Parker, a former prosecutor who announced his resignation this week alongside three other deputy mayors.</p><p>The resignations followed a move last week by the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against Mr. Adams, a decision that was criticized by the former acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan as a quid pro quo to secure Mr. Adams’s cooperation with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</p><p>As deputy mayor for public safety, Mr. Parker was deeply involved in decisions about the city’s role in Mr. Trump’s deportation efforts. He attended a meeting last week with Mr. Adams and Thomas Homan, the Trump border czar.</p></div></div>
