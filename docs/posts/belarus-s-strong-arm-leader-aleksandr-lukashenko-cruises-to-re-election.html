Lukashenko of Belarus, cruised to his seventh election victory in a row on Sunday in a contest that his exiled opponents dismissed as a sham, whose only purpose was to cement his autocratic grip on the former Soviet republic, Russia’s closest ally.</p><p>“Don’t use the word election to describe this farce,” said Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, an opposition leader who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/world/europe/belarus-election-Svetlana-Tikhanovskaya.html" title="">fled Belarus after the country’s previous presidential vote in 2020</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-protests-crackdown.html" title="">brutal crackdown</a> on nationwide protests over election fraud. “It is a staged performance by Lukashenko to cling to power at any cost.”</p><p>A survey <a href="https://belta.by/society/view/stali-izvestny-itogi-ekzitpola-na-vyborah-prezidenta-belarusi-691645-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of voters leaving polling</a> places that was released by state media Sunday evening showed Mr. Lukashenko getting 87.6 percent of the vote, more than the 81 percent he claimed to have won in 2020.<span>  </span>Exit polls are controlled by the state like all aspects of elections in Belarus and generally reflect the ultimate outcome.</p><p>Unlike in 2020, when Ms. Tikhanovskaya was allowed to run against Mr. Lukashenko and declared herself the winner, Sunday’s election was a tightly controlled and tame affair, featuring only candidates loyal to the president. None<span>  </span>expressed any desire to actually defeat Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist since 1994.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Four rival candidates, according to the exit poll, garnered less than two percent of the vote each, except for the leader of the Communist Party, Sergei Syrankov, who captured 2.7 percent.</p><p>With all of Mr. Lukashenko’s prominent opponents either in jail or in exile and Belarus’ media outlets all cheering for the incumbent, the result was a foregone conclusion. But it is one that still mattered to the president, who is eager to show his country — and also President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — that the turmoil of 2020 has been tamed. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Belarus’s exiled opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, takes part in the March of the Belarusians, on the day of Belarus’s presidential election, in Warsaw on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Kowalewski/Agencja Wyborcza.Pl, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_327" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement on Sunday,</a> the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the election as a “sham” that “has been neither free, nor fair.”<span>  </span></p><p>But foreign election observers, drawn from far-right political parties like Alternative for Germany and other pro-Russian groups, hailed the vote as a triumph for democracy and denounced tart criticism of the election by the European Parliament and other institutions.“They say that there is a dictatorship here, but I don’t think so — the reality in Belarus is completely different,” Krastyo Vrachev, an observer representing a fringe nationalist party from Bulgaria, told Belarus’s state news agency. “People are calm and communicate with ease, in Europe this is not at all the case,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The election was certainly calm, so much so that Mr. Lukashenko barely bothered to campaign, saying he was too busy to take part in a debate with four, state-selected rival candidates or to hold rallies. In a nod to conventional politics, however, last week he signed a decree raising pensions by 10 percent starting Feb. 1.</p><p>A <a href="https://en.belaruspolls.org/wave-20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent survey of public opinion in Belarus by Chatham House</a>, a British research group, indicated widespread dissatisfaction with the economy, which has been hit hard by<span>  </span>economic sanctions imposed on the country over its support for Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Just 11 percent of respondents were definitely satisfied with the economy, while only 32 percent said they supported Russia’s invasion.</p><p>Mr. Lukashenko’s main appeal, according to the survey, is his “favorable image” as a “politician striving to prevent Belarus from being involved in the military conflict following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this photograph released by Russian state media, Russia’s president, Vladimir V.

The names of those released were not made public.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, <a href="https://x.com/secrubio/status/1883501830182948893?s=46&amp;t=4qPcdfZVvguwYr8xs2mG-g" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a social media post</a> on Sunday, indicated that they included a United States citizen whom he named as Anastasia Nuhfer “who was taken under JOE BIDEN!” Mr. Rubio said she had been “unilterally released” thanks to President Trump’s leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>None of Mr. Lukashenko’s most prominent opponents, who include Ms. Tikhanovskaya’s husband, Sergei, have been set free. The United States and European Union have left sanctions in place.</p><p>In a sign that the authorities are hoping for a more sympathetic hearing from the new Trump administration, Belarus’s state media last week reported gleefully that, following the inauguration in Washington, the State Department had <a href="https://www.state.gov/denouncing-sham-elections-and-continued-repression-in-belarus/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed from its website a statement</a> critical of Sunday’s election that had been made by the outgoing secretary of state, Antony Blinken.</p><p>Mr. Blinken’s deleted statement denounced the Belarus election as a farce, saying:“The United States joins many of our European allies in assessing that elections cannot be credible in an environment where censorship is ubiquitous and independent media outlets no longer exist.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
