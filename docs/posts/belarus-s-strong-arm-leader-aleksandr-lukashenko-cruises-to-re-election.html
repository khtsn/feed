Lukashenko of Belarus, cruised to his seventh election victory in a row on Sunday in a contest that his exiled opponents dismissed as a sham whose only purpose was to cement his autocratic grip on the former Soviet republic, Russia’s closest ally.</p><p>“Don’t use the word election to describe this farce,” said Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, an opposition leader who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/world/europe/belarus-election-Svetlana-Tikhanovskaya.html" title="">fled Belarus after the country’s previous presidential vote in 2020</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-protests-crackdown.html" title="">brutal crackdown</a> on nationwide protests over election fraud. “It is a staged performance by Lukashenko to cling to power at any cost.”</p><p>— </p><p><a href="https://belta.by/society/view/za-lukashenko-na-vyborah-v-belarusi-progolosovali-8682-izbiratelej-691695-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Official results released early Monday</a> awarded Mr. Lukashenko yet another landslide victory with 86.82 percent of the vote. That is even more than the 81 percent he claimed in the contested 2020 election — a result that his opponents and Western governments dismissed as implausibly high, and that set off huge street protests.</p><p>With dissenting voices inside the country silenced by Mr. Lukashenko’s expansive security apparatus, there is little chance of protests this time. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Unlike in 2020, when Ms. Tikhanovskaya was allowed to run against Mr. Lukashenko and declared herself the winner, Sunday’s election was a tightly controlled and tame affair, featuring only candidates loyal to the president. None expressed any desire to actually defeat Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist since 1994.</p><p>Ms. Tikhanovskaya, out of the country since 2020, did not take part in Sunday’s election and was instead in Warsaw, leading a protest against Mr. Lukashenko, who mocked her efforts and<span>  </span>claimed that President Trump had cut off funding to her opposition movement in exile. He appeared to be referring to an executive order last week that halted virtually all foreign aid for a 90-day reassessment period.</p><p>Three candidates running against Mr. Lukashenko, according to official results reported by Belta, the state news agency, garnered around or less than two percent of the vote each. A fourth, the leader of the Communist Party, Sergei Syrankov, was listed as winning 3.2 percent.</p><p>At a televised election debate last week, which the president did not join, Mr. Syrankov, saying said he wanted to be “honest,” acknowledged: “Everyone in this studio knows that Aleksandr Lukashenko is going to win.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>With all of Mr. Lukashenko’s prominent opponents either in jail or in exile and Belarus’s media outlets all cheering for the incumbent, the result was a foregone conclusion. But it is one that still mattered to the president, who is eager to show his country — and also President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — that the turmoil of 2020 has been tamed. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Belarus’s exiled opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, takes part in the March of the Belarusians in Warsaw, on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Robert Kowalewski/Agencja Wyborcza.Pl, via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_327" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement on Sunday,</a> the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the election as a “sham” that “has been neither free, nor fair.”<span>  </span></p><p>But foreign election observers, drawn from Africa, former Soviet republics and far-right political parties in Europe like Alternative for Germany, hailed the vote as a triumph for democracy and denounced tart criticism of the election by European officials and the European Parliament. “They say that there is a dictatorship here, but I don’t think so — the reality in Belarus is completely different,” Krastyo Vrachev, an observer representing a fringe nationalist party from Bulgaria, told Belarus’s state news agency. “People are calm and communicate with ease; in Europe this is not at all the case,” he added.</p><p>The election was certainly calm, so much so that Mr. Lukashenko barely bothered to campaign, saying he was too busy to take part in a debate with four state-selected rival candidates or to hold rallies. In a nod to conventional politics, however, last week he signed a decree raising pensions by 10 percent starting Feb. 1.</p><p>A <a href="https://en.belaruspolls.org/wave-20" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent survey of public opinion in Belarus by Chatham House</a>, a British research group, indicated widespread dissatisfaction with the economy, which has been hit hard by<span>  </span>economic sanctions imposed on the country over its support for Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Just 11 percent of respondents were definitely satisfied with the economy, while only 32 percent said they supported Russia’s invasion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Lukashenko’s main appeal, according to the survey, is his “favorable image” as a “politician striving to prevent Belarus from being involved in the military conflict following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In this photograph released by Russian state media, Russia’s president, Vladimir V.

S. secretary of state at the time, Condoleezza Rice.</a></p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>While delighting in taunting the West, particularly neighboring Poland, and displaying his loyalty to Moscow, Mr. Lukashenko has in recent months signaled a desire to improve frosty relations with Western capitals by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/24/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-putin-west-sanctions.html" title="">releasing political prisoners.</a></p><p>This process, widely seen as an effort to get relief from Western sanctions, continued on Friday when Mr. Lukashenko pardoned 15 more prisoners, including five people jailed for “extremist crimes,” a blanket term used to describe criticism of the president. The names of those released were not made public.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, <a href="https://x.com/secrubio/status/1883501830182948893?s=46&amp;t=4qPcdfZVvguwYr8xs2mG-g" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a social media post</a> on Sunday, indicated that they included a United States citizen whom he identified as Anastasia Nuhfer, “who was taken under JOE BIDEN!” he said in the post. Mr. Rubio said Ms. Nuhfer had been “unilaterally released,” thanks to President Trump’s leadership.</p><p>At a news conference in Minsk on Sunday, Mr. Lukashenko denied that he was releasing prisoners to curry favor abroad, saying, “I don’t give a damn about the West.” He said his decision to set some people free “is based on the principle of humanity.”</p><p>None of Mr. Lukashenko’s most prominent opponents, who include Ms. Tikhanovskaya’s husband, Sergei, have been set free. The United States and the European Union have left sanctions in place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In a sign that the authorities are hoping for a more sympathetic hearing from the new Trump administration, Belarus’s state media last week reported gleefully that, following the inauguration in Washington, the State Department had <a href="https://www.state.gov/denouncing-sham-elections-and-continued-repression-in-belarus/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed from its website a statement</a> critical of Sunday’s election that had been made by the outgoing secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken.</p><p>Mr. Blinken’s deleted statement denounced the Belarus election as a farce, saying, “The United States joins many of our European allies in assessing that elections cannot be credible in an environment where censorship is ubiquitous and independent media outlets no longer exist.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Andrew Higgins is the East and Central Europe bureau chief for The Times based in Warsaw.
