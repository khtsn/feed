He was 65.</p><p>His death was announced by his family. They did not cite a cause or say where he died, but they thanked the staff at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.</p><p>Often called “the man of steal” by sportswriters, Henderson holds the career record for stolen bases with 1,406 — a mark unlikely to be swiped from him anytime soon, or perhaps ever. He stole more than 100 bases in three seasons, and his 130 in 1982 is still the single-season record.</p><p>Henderson also owns the record for runs scored, with 2,295. Eighty-one of those runs were the result of leadoff home runs — another record. His 2,190 walks rank him second behind Barry Bonds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Without exaggerating one inch, you could find 50 Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don’t own as many records, and as many important records, as Rickey Henderson,” the baseball statistician and historian Bill James once wrote.</p><p>Henderson played for nine teams over 25 seasons, but he spent most of his career with his hometown Oakland A’s (on four separate occasions) and the New York Yankees.</p><p>In addition to being one of baseball’s most exciting players, Henderson was legendarily eccentric.</p><p>He was unaware of many of his teammates’ names. During the 1993 season, he missed three games in August with frostbite after falling asleep with an ice pack on his injured foot. He framed a $1 million bonus check instead of cashing it.</p><p>Though he was frequently accused of being self-centered, Henderson wasn’t strictly an “I” kind of player. He often referred to himself in the third person; he once said, “Rickey don’t like it when Rickey can’t find Rickey’s limo.”</p><p>Another time, while Henderson was playing with Oakland, the catcher Terry Steinbach found him in the locker room stark naked and mumbling, “Rickey’s gonna have a game” five minutes before the game.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I’m pretty sure the anthem is playing,” Steinbach recalled in Howard Bryant’s 2022 biography, <a href="https://howardbryantbooks.com/rickey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Rickey: The Life and Legend of an American Original.”</a> “He’s still in the locker room, talking to himself, ‘Rickey’s gonna have a good day.’”</p><p>About 30 seconds before the first pitch, Henderson put on his uniform and announced, “Rickey’s ready to go!”</p><p>“He walks down the tunnel,” Steinbach said. “Gets his bat. Hits a home run.”</p><p>At 5-foot-10, Henderson was smaller than many big leaguers, but he overcame his size with a combination of horse power, a savant-like ability to exploit deficiencies in pitchers, and an extreme bravado that many players viewed as cockiness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Henderson during Game 2 of the 1989 World Series against the San Francisco Giants at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.

And two pitches later, he was standing on third with Rayford after having stolen two bases.”</p><p>Drafted by the A’s in the fourth round in 1976, Henderson showed his potential almost immediately in the minor leagues. One of his coaches thought that he could defy physics by outrunning the baseball.</p><p>“He’d only been in the minors for a half-hour,” Mr. Bryant wrote in his biography, “but there was immediately something about Rickey’s style that embarrassed even professional players.”</p><p>His crouched batting stance shrank his already small strike zone. (The Los Angeles Times sportswriter Jim Murray would later write that “Henderson has a strike zone the size of Hitler’s heart.”)</p><p>“The guy is impossible to pitch to,” Frank Quintero, who pitched against Henderson in the minor leagues, once recalled. “His strike zone is about 10 inches deep. He drives me crazy, and the umpires, too. And when you do come in with a strike — boom, he rips it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Oakland called up Henderson about halfway through the 1979 season. The A’s were terrible, but Henderson hit .274 and led the team in stolen bases with 33. The next year, the A’s hired Billy Martin as manager, and the team improved. So did Henderson: He hit .303, walked 117 times, stole 100 bases and played in the first of 10 All Star games during his career.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Henderson celebrated after stealing the 939th base of his career in a game against the Yankees in Oakland on May 1, 1991, breaking Lou Brock’s record. “Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing,” he said. “But today, I am the greatest of all time.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Risberg/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>As a base stealer, he was a kind of poker player. He studied pitchers to learn their tells.</p><p>“Certain guys, they can see a guy do a certain thing with their glove and know what pitch is coming,” Henderson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915044841/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/baseball/mlb/09/10/ballard.hendersonrollins/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> Sports Illustrated in 2008. “I couldn’t do that. But I can get on first base and I can tell you by his move if that pitcher is going to first base or home plate every time.”</p><p>Right before taking off, Henderson would sometimes announce, “Rickey’s gotta go!”</p><p>He ran low and slid headfirst — inspired, he said, by airplanes.</p><p>“I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up,” Henderson told Sports Illustrated. “Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Henderson was a line-drive hitter early in his career, but he decided to start hitting for power after contract negotiations with the A’s after the 1982 season.</p><p>“I stole 130 bases and went to arbitration, and they said that the only guy who earned the salary was a guy that hit home runs,” Henderson told Sports Illustrated in 2009, just before he was inducted into the <a href="https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/henderson-rickey" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. “That’s when I decided I had to elevate my game and do something different.

Together, they developed “Billy Ball,” an aggressive, in-your-face style of play at odds with the game’s genteel origins.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“Billy was the publisher of Billy Ball,” Henderson often said, “and I was the author.”</p><p>In June 1989, with Henderson about to enter free agency, the Yankees traded him back to the A’s, who were chasing the American League pennant. Henderson, then 30 years old, was hitting just .247 and had been caught stealing eight times.</p><p>“The Yankees were willing to part with their left fielder and leadoff hitter because of a feeling throughout the organization that his skills had begun to fade,” the Yankees beat reporter Michael Martinez <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/22/sports/yankees-send-henderson-back-to-oakland.html?timespastHighlight=rickey,Henderson,oakland" title="">wrote</a> in The New York Times.</p><p>Henderson got hot and hit more than .500 during a 20-game stretch, leading the A’s to the playoffs.</p><p>He was the most valuable player of the American League Championship Series versus Toronto that year, batting .400 with two home runs, eight runs scored, seven walks and eight stolen bases — “a performance for the ages,” <a href="https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/rickey-henderson/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Society for American Baseball Research.</p><p>Oakland swept the San Francisco Giants in the World Series, which was memorably disrupted by an earthquake. The next season, Henderson batted .325, scored 119 runs, stole 65 bases and tied his career high of 28 home runs. He was named American League M.V.P.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>He won a second World Series in 1993 with the Toronto Blue Jays.</p><p>“Rickey was one of the best players in the history of Major League Baseball,” his friend and former teammate Dave Winfield said in an interview. “He could influence the game in so many ways — with power, speed, intimidation and keeping the opposition on their heels.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Henderson warming up during Game 3 of the 1989 World Series at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NewsBase/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Rickey Nelson Henley was born in Chicago in the back seat of his family’s Oldsmobile on Christmas morning in 1958.</p><p>When Rickey was 2, his parents, John and Bobbie Henley, broke up. His mother moved with Rickey and his siblings to Pine Bluff, Ark., where she had grown up.</p><p>Not long after, she moved to California to find work, leaving her children behind with her mother. In California, she married Paul Henderson, and the new family eventually settled together in Oakland.</p><p>As a teenager, Rickey was primarily interested in football.</p><p>“Rickey played for contact,” Mr. Bryant wrote in his biography, “like the time in the seventh or eighth grade when all the kids were playing in the driveway and Rickey went out to catch a pass, stretching out to the end of the driveway, stretching … stretching … and — bam! — ran headfirst into a car.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Rickey got up and kept playing.</p><p>Though he played baseball in youth leagues, he didn’t consider playing in high school until his sophomore year, when his guidance counselor called him into her office. The baseball team was short on players and needed him, she said. No way, he told her.</p><p>“She offered me a quarter,” he told Mr. Bryant. “Hits, runs, stolen bases — a quarter each. I said, ‘I’m about to make me some money.’”</p><p>He joined the team. In one game, he earned a whopping $5.25.</p><p>Henderson continued playing football each fall, but eventually his speed and line-drive-hitting ability drew the attention of professional baseball scouts, notably J.J. Guinn, who worked for the A’s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 2021, Henderson was reunited with J.J.

It was his 939th stolen base, surpassing Lou Brock’s record.</p><p>There was a celebration on the field. Speaking to the crowd on a microphone, Henderson said: “Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing. But today, I am the greatest of all time.”</p><p>Survivors include his wife, Pamela. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.</p><p>Henderson’s last season in the major leagues was 2003, with the Dodgers. But he had difficulty quitting and went back to the minors.</p><p>One afternoon in 2005, David Grann of The New Yorker visited Henderson in San Diego, where he was suiting up for the Surf Dawgs, an independent team, in what would be his final season.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Henderson in the dugout at Tony Gwynn Stadium on the campus of San Diego State University in 2005.
