</span>&#39;s partnership agreement with the VCT EMEA due to a &#34;breach of the team&#39;s contractual agreement with the league.&#34;</p>

<p>One of the 10 initial teams to partner with Riot to form the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1190/champions-tour-2023-emea-league/regular-season" target="_blank">EMEA League</a> back in 2023, KOI has historically performed poorly over the years, never once reaching the playoffs of any regional event. Despite a mid-season <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/488535/koi-overhauls-roster-with-natank-monsteerr-baddyg-and-simoz" target="_blank">roster overhaul</a> this year, the team still failed to deal any damage and placed among the bottom of the barrel, just ahead of the now-relegated <span data-ref-id="1">

<p>Following Riot&#39;s announcement of the organization&#39;s departure, KOI immediately <a href="https://x.com/MovistarKOI/status/1964325222460322276" target="_blank">released an update</a> regarding its VCT slot. Co-founder Ibai “Ibai” Llanos explained in a 10-minute video that the reason provided for the termination was an accumulated mix of lack of content, low skin sales in 2025, and poor performance within the VCT.</p>

<p>He also repeatedly stated that there was never any sort of warning or discussion with Riot prior to their meeting nearly 12 hours ago, when KOI was informed of the decision to terminate the partnership for the first time.</p>

<p>KOI&#39;s removal from the VCT has forced the organization to reassess its approach for the 2026 season. Initially, they had planned to completely rebuild the roster from scratch with academy coach <span data-ref-id="3">Kirian		&#34;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/player/19609/yaba">Yaba</a>&#34;
		Martínez</span> taking the reins of the project, but Ibai has now stated that such positions and jobs no longer exist.</p>

<p>KOI&#39;s future in Valorant now remains unclear, and Riot has yet to announce which organization will fill the gap left in the EMEA.</p>

			<p>I do think judging by by the fact that KOI (according to Ibai) were not given any notice or any chance for negotiation or any sort of warning/ultimatum, it seems pretty likely to me that Riot&#39;s mind was already made up because they had a specific org in mind that they wanted to bring on.</p>
<p>Given the timing (a couple of weeks after the end of stage 2), if they bring in Gentle Mates I will be 100% convinced that that was the reason.</p>
<p>Ibai also said that Riot absolutely had the right to kick KOI, but clearly if a team is underperforming wrt their contract requirements I would imagine the natural first step would be to approach them and tell them that they&#39;ll have to improve or they&#39;re out. No notice means they don&#39;t want KOI to get their shit together, which only really makes sense if they have a replacement lined up.</p>
<p>But of course this is all speculation and maybe there was more going on behind the scenes.</p>		</div>

	<div data-post-id="5416058">

Like, coach already signed, talk with players, sponsors. God imagine talking with sponsors that you are suddenly out. Horrible way to handle this by Riot. There are thousands of better ways to handle this. I infer they wanted to do this so it dies quickly before Champions, but this looks straight disrespectful unless there is something missing here, which I doubt, knowing how Riot works. </p>
