    <h1>Riot terminates VCT partnership with KOI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<p>I do think judging by by the fact that KOI (according to Ibai) were not given any notice or any chance for negotiation or any sort of warning/ultimatum, it seems pretty likely to me that Riot&#39;s mind was already made up because they had a specific org in mind that they wanted to bring on.</p>
<p>Given the timing (a couple of weeks after the end of stage 2), if they bring in Gentle Mates I will be 100% convinced that that was the reason.</p>
<p>Ibai also said that Riot absolutely had the right to kick KOI, but clearly if a team is underperforming wrt their contract requirements I would imagine the natural first step would be to approach them and tell them that they&#39;ll have to improve or they&#39;re out. No notice means they don&#39;t want KOI to get their shit together, which only really makes sense if they have a replacement lined up.</p>
<p>But of course this is all speculation and maybe there was more going on behind the scenes.</p>		</div></div>
