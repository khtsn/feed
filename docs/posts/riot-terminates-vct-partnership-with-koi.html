</span>&#39;s partnership agreement with the VCT EMEA due to a &#34;breach of the team&#39;s contractual agreement with the league.&#34;</p>

<p>One of the 10 initial teams to partner with Riot to form the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1190/champions-tour-2023-emea-league/regular-season" target="_blank">EMEA League</a> back in 2023, KOI has historically performed poorly over the years, never once reaching the playoffs of any regional event. Despite a mid-season <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/488535/koi-overhauls-roster-with-natank-monsteerr-baddyg-and-simoz" target="_blank">roster overhaul</a> this year, the team still failed to deal any damage and placed among the bottom of the barrel, just ahead of the now-relegated <span data-ref-id="1">

<p>Following Riot&#39;s announcement of the organization&#39;s departure, KOI immediately <a href="https://x.com/MovistarKOI/status/1964325222460322276" target="_blank">released an update</a> regarding its VCT slot. Co-founder Ibai “Ibai” Llanos explained in a 10-minute video that the reason provided for the termination was an accumulated mix of lack of content, low skin sales in 2025, and poor performance within the VCT.</p>

<p>He also repeatedly stated that there was never any sort of warning or discussion with Riot prior to their meeting nearly 12 hours ago, when KOI was informed of the decision to terminate the partnership for the first time.</p>

<p>KOI&#39;s removal from the VCT has forced the organization to reassess its approach for the 2026 season. Initially, they had planned to completely rebuild the roster from scratch with academy coach <span data-ref-id="3">Kirian		&#34;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/19609/yaba">Yaba</a>&#34;
		Martínez</span> taking the reins of the project, but Ibai has now stated that such positions and jobs no longer exist.</p>

<p>KOI&#39;s future in Valorant now remains unclear, and Riot has yet to announce which organization will fill the gap left in the EMEA.</p>
