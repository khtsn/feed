He was 96. </p><p>His death was confirmed by Annique Dunning, the executive director of Sherwood Forest Plantation, a private foundation established by the Tyler family.</p><p>Mr. Tyler suffered a series of small strokes starting in 2012 and was later diagnosed with dementia. In recent years, his son William Bouknight Tyler oversaw the James River plantation that had been his family’s ancestral home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Mr. Tyler, a retired businessman, and his older brother, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/us/lyon-gardiner-tyler-jr-dead.html" title="">Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr.</a>, who died at age 95 in 2020, were sons of Lyon Gardiner Tyler Sr. (1853-1935), a longtime president of the College of William &amp; Mary. Their grandfather was the U.S. president who pushed for the annexation of Texas as American expansion moved west, but he is perhaps best known for the Whig Party’s memorable 1840 presidential campaign slogan, “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>John Tyler was the first vice president to succeed a dead president.

But that was hardly the case with the former president and his academically distinguished son. And in 2012, when the website <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mental Floss</a> reported that two grandsons of President Tyler were still alive, the news — “an amazing, seemingly impossible piece of American trivia,” <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/01/president-tyler-grandson-alive.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as New York magazine put it</a> — went viral.</p><p>Yahoo, The Huffington Post, Fox News and Politico all rushed to publish articles. There were interviews with the grandsons, who told of other famous ancestors, including a great-grandfather, John Tyler Sr., born in 1747, who was a roommate of Thomas Jefferson at William &amp; Mary, served in the Continental Army, became governor of Virginia and had eight children, including the future president.</p><p>“I heard too much about presidents growing up,” Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr. told the Daughters of the American Revolution chapter in Dyersburg, Tenn., in 2013. He recalled family anecdotes about Patrick Henry, Andrew Jackson, Daniel Webster, the American Revolution, the Civil War and, especially, President John Tyler, his grandfather.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Born in 1790, less than a year after Washington’s first inauguration, John Tyler became the governor of Virginia, a United States representative and a senator. In the election of 1840, the Whig Party chose William Henry Harrison, a former governor of the Indiana Territory and senator from Ohio, as its presidential candidate, and Mr. Tyler as his vice-presidential running mate.</p><p>Historians say John Tyler, a lifelong slave owner and advocate of states’ rights, was selected to balance the ticket and attract Southerners who feared Mr. Harrison might harbor abolitionist leanings. Mr. Harrison, known as Old Tippecanoe, had led American forces that defeated Native Americans at the Battle of Tippecanoe in Indiana in 1811.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A campaign banner with a variation of the slogan “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,” used in the 1840 presidential campaign.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via the collection of the Ross County Historical Society, Ohio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The Whigs attacked Martin Van Buren, the Democratic incumbent, with a bandwagon campaign featuring the “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too” slogan. Mr. Harrison and Mr. Tyler won handily and were sworn in on March 4, 1841. But Mr. Harrison died of pneumonia after only a month in office. Mr. Tyler, the first vice president to succeed a dead president, quickly took the oath of office, moved into the White House and assumed the full powers of the presidency.</p><p>His claim to the presidency was disputed by many in Congress and never accepted by some, who referred to him as “His Accidency.” But his forceful grasp of the office set a precedent and served as a model for successions until the issue was clarified by the 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Tyler, who regarded much of the Whig platform as unconstitutional, vetoed legislation and bypassed Whig leaders, who expelled him from the party and tried, unsuccessfully, to impeach him. Most of his cabinet resigned. His most notable achievement was his advocacy for the annexation of Texas, which became the nation’s 28th state in 1845.</p><p>Robert Seager II, in a 1963 biography, “And Tyler Too,” called Mr. Tyler “one of America’s most obscure chief executives,” adding, “His countrymen generally remember him, if they have heard of him at all, as the rhyming end of a catchy campaign slogan.”</p><p>After leaving the presidency, Mr. Tyler retired to his Virginia plantation and withdrew from politics. When the Civil War began in 1861, he sided with the Confederacy and was elected to the Confederate legislature, but he died in 1862, at age 71, before taking office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Harrison Tyler, right, in 1932, with his brother Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr. and his father, Lyon Gardiner Sr., who served as president of the College of William &amp; Mary from 1888 to 1919.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Sherwood Forest</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He fathered 15 children, the most of any American president, with two wives: Letitia Christian, who died in 1842, and Julia Gardiner, a 24-year-old debutante who married him in 1844, when he was 54.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The 13th child, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, who lived to 81, served as president of William &amp; Mary, the nation’s second oldest college (chartered in 1693), from 1888 to 1919.
