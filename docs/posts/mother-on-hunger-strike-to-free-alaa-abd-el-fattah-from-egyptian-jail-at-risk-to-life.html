He added, “there is now immediate risk to life including further deterioration or death,” and that Ms. Soueif “is in particular at high risk of sudden death with continued fasting.”</p><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer, speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, said he would continue to raise the case at the highest levels of the Egyptian government and push for Mr. Abd El Fattah’s release.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It is an incredibly difficult situation for them,” Mr. Starmer said, adding that he had met with the family a few days ago and “will do everything I can to ensure the release in this case. That includes phone calls as necessary.”</p><p>Mr. Abd El Fattah <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/opinion/egypt-prison-democracy.html" title="">became a prominent voice of the Egyptian uprising</a> in 2011 that toppled the country’s authoritarian ruler, Hosni Mubarak. But an Islamist political party took power in Egypt’s first democratic presidential election, and then a widespread backlash to its rule allowed President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to later seize power. Since then, Mr. el-Sisi has cracked down on dissenting voices.</p><p>Mr. Abd El Fattah has spent much of the last decade in prison after two earlier arrests, in 2006 for protesting for judicial independence and then in 2011 for an article critical of Egypt’s military. He was detained again from 2013 until <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/world/middleeast/alaa-abd-el-fattah-egypt-blogger.html" title="">March 2019</a> on charges of organizing an illegal protest. Months later, in September 2019, he was arrested again and sentenced in 2021 to five years for sharing a Facebook post about abuse in prison.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>He had been set to be released from prison in September 2024, but the Egyptian authorities said that they would not count his two years of pretrial detention toward his sentence, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/16/world/middleeast/egypt-prisoners.html" title="">increasingly routine practice in the country</a>. Mr. Abd El Fattah is now scheduled for release in 2027, although he and his family fear he could be held indefinitely.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>While in jail, he successfully applied for British citizenship through his mother, who is a dual national.</p><p>Several British lawmakers wrote <a href="https://fairsq.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Letter-to-Prime-Minister-29.01.25.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter to Mr. Starmer last month</a> urging him to “intensify efforts across the whole of government to make Alaa’s urgent release a reality.”</p><p>But pressuring the Egyptian authorities on individual cases can backfire, diplomats in Cairo have said. The British have pressed for consular visits with Mr. Abd El Fattah and called for his release since he gained British citizenship in 2021, but they have had no success. And Mr. Abd El Fattah’s family worry time is running out.</p><p>“If Keir Starmer would pick up the phone and speak to President Sisi, I believe that he can secure the release of my brother, and save my mother’s life,” Sanaa Seif, Mr. Abd El Fattah’s younger sister, said in a statement, adding, “Every moment that he waits means that my mother is more likely to die.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Megan Specia reports on Britain, Ireland and the Ukraine war for The Times.
