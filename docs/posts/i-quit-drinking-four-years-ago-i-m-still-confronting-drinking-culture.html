Maybe you’ve committed to Dry January. Maybe you were alarmed when the surgeon general last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/health/alcohol-surgeon-general-warning.html" title="">said</a> that consuming alcohol is a leading preventable cause of cancer, and that alcoholic beverages should carry warning labels more like those for cigarettes.</p><p>Whatever the reason, a reconsideration of alcohol in our lives is in the air.</p><p>As someone who stopped drinking four years ago, shortly after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/opinion/brother-death-lessons.html" title="">my brother died</a> — for me, a moment of reflection — I am always encouraged when people tell me that they are considering quitting. This is in part because I know that quitting involves more than conquering your thirst; it’s also about confronting the aspects of our culture that normalize and romanticize drinking and can be suspicious and dismissive of those who quit.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>I quit drinking because I was tired of being tired, of feeling foggy and sick, of not being able to recognize myself. I felt like I was dying, and I wanted to live.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But quitting didn’t come without fears.</p><p>I didn’t know who I would be without alcohol. I didn’t know if I would still be fun and funny. More important to me, I didn’t know if I would be able to access my creativity without some way of achieving transcendence.</p><p>In her autobiography, the late singer Natalie Cole describes how, at one point in her career, “I had really believed that I needed drugs to perform at my best.” At one point, I worried that the poetry of language would elude me without drinking.</p><p>That worry proved unfounded.</p><p>Giving up drinking was one of the best decisions I ever made. I am healthier and happier. I think more clearly and sleep more soundly. I no longer lose things or forget things. I can sit quietly with my thoughts without becoming antsy. And I have saved a remarkable amount of money.</p><p>Someone once told me that I was one of the lucky ones: My drinking was habitual, not a physical addiction. Indeed, my body didn’t crave alcohol, nor did I experience withdrawal. When I stopped drinking, the test was navigating difficult emotional moments.</p><p>Later, I would come to realize that drinking was a way for me to lessen the weight of feeling overwhelmed. When I drank, I could moderate the highs and lows. Life sometimes felt brutal, so I blunted it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Switching off the impulse to drink turned out to be only one foot taking the step; fighting the culture around drinking was the other.</p><p>I always understood the moral judgments about overconsumption, but I hadn’t anticipated those about nonconsumption.</p><p>Nondrinkers are routinely mocked as either nagging, joy-deprived, vibe killers or lacking the self-control to properly partake in a normal part of adult socialization. Surely, people often seem to think, something tragic must have precipitated your sobriety, a devastating diagnosis or grand embarrassment — you didn’t choose the bench, you were ejected from the game. The problem was you, not the alcohol.</p><p>It is as if some people need a trauma story to make sense of your decision to stop drinking; otherwise, your sudden abstinence casts a pall over their continued consumption, and they read your personal choice as a critique of theirs.</p><p>For this reason, people who stop drinking are constantly quizzed about why; I get asked all the time. Some people have an answer that satisfies this question — if they describe, for instance, hitting rock bottom — but others don’t. Regardless, it’s really none of anyone’s business.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>I now sometimes end the inquiry with a joke: “I quit because I’d already drunk everything.” This is usually sufficiently self-deprecating to make people move on.</p><p>But the question often remains in lingering stares: Why wasn’t I able to remain engaged in the glamour of elite drinking, in which people become amateur sommeliers, displaying their knowledge and collections of fine wines as class markers? Why wasn’t I able to enjoy an occasional pretentious cocktail prepared with herbs or exotic bitters and garnished with dried fruit or edible flowers?</p><p>Well, elite alcohol is still alcohol, and I still don’t want or need it.</p><p>I don’t think everyone realizes what an othering experience it is to be treated like a freak because you have made a healthy choice.</p><p>It is precisely because I’m subject to these judgments as a nondrinker that I try not to judge those who do. My boyfriend is a moderate drinker, and I will occasionally meet friends at a bar.</p><p>But now the sadness of those spaces is the thing that strikes me, and I’m unable to connect to the part of me that once enjoyed them. How had I grown accustomed to the smell of dirty bar towels and cheap disinfectant? How had I not detected the loneliness hidden in the loud laughter? How had I not seen it then, as I do now, as a funeral dressed up as a festival?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At home, I keep both alcoholic and nonalcoholic options on hand for when I have company. I occasionally host cocktail parties — I’m still searching for a better name that quickly signals “evening gathering” — and I’ve been pleasantly surprised that an increasing number of guests have joined me in not drinking.</p><p>I view my role in my friend group not as a scold but to model a dynamic sobriety. I’m trying to relieve the killjoy stigma so that people know that they can become sober and remain social. I’m trying to change the culture.</p><hr/></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Charles M.
