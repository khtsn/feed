Some of the goods were sold at Dunkin’, and were produced before Dec. 13, 2024, the F.D.A. said. The suspected source of the contamination was not identified.</p><p>The recall, which went into effect on Jan. 7, was upgraded on Wednesday to a Class II, which is defined by the F.D.A. as “a situation in which use of, or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The agency did not say if there had been any illnesses related to the recalled baked goods.</p><p><a href="https://www.fgfbrands.com/voluntary-recall-of-donuts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, FGF Brands said the voluntary recall was “a precautionary measure based on non-product related findings” at one of its doughnut facilities in the United States.</p><p>It added that “no doughnuts or food contact surfaces ever tested positive for listeria.”</p><p>The company also noted that the recall was completed in early January, “and does not implicate anything that is currently, or was recently, on the market. “We take food safety seriously and acted with an abundance of caution,” the statement said.</p><p>Dunkin’ did not immediately respond to inquiries on Sunday.</p><p>Listeria is the third leading cause of death from food-borne illness in the United States, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>Infections from listeria, which is bacteria that can contaminate foods, are rare but can cause potentially serious illnesses.</p><p>Typical symptoms include fever and headaches.
