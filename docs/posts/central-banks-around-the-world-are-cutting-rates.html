    <h1>Central Banks Around the World Are Cutting Rates</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Similarly, central banks in Norway and Sweden are also expected to hold rates at their meetings later in September, as they emphasize their gradual approach. The Swiss National Bank is expected to continue its quarterly interest rate cuts, which it started in March, when its officials meet later this month.</p><p>Policymakers “are pretty confident in the direction of travel for rates, that these need to come down, but that they need to be cautious,” said Katharine Neiss, an economist at PGIM Fixed Income, an asset manager.</p><p>The pivot at the Fed to cut rates will have important ripple effects as it eases global financial conditions, Ms. Neiss added. If the Fed makes an outsize cut on Wednesday, it could also “open up the space for European policymakers, including the U.K., that they could then cut more aggressively as well,” she said. That would most likely happen next year once the remnants of the energy price shock disperse and policymakers have a clearer sense of what price pressures are left.</p><p>But there are outliers around the rest of the world. Many countries took an aggressive response to the inflation shock after the pandemic, while the Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-easy monetary policy, hoping to engineer the kind of steady long-term inflation the Japanese economy needed. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/business/japan-inflation-rates.html" title="">as rising prices stung Japanese households</a> and did not help businesses as expected, the central bank broke with its posture, raising rates in July for only the second time in nearly two decades.</p><p>In emerging markets, central banks are moving in different directions. Brazil’s central bank is expected to raise rates on Thursday for the first time in two years. Brazilian officials began their easing cycle in August 2023 as inflation slowed toward their target. But now, they are expected to reverse course as economic growth picks up and brings with it fears of a resurgence in inflation. Central bankers in Mexico are expected to continue rate cuts, and the central bank in South Africa is expected to cut rates on Thursday for the first time since the pandemic.</p></div></div>
