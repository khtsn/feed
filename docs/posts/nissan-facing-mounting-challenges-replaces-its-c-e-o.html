Ivan Espinosa, 46, a Nissan veteran of two decades and the company’s chief planning officer, will take over as leader next month, the company said.</p><p>The move follows a tumultuous year for Nissan, putting the nearly century-old company into a leadership transition midway through a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/nissan-job-cuts.html" title="">restructuring effort</a> and at a time of heightened uncertainty for the industry.</p><p>Yasushi Kimura, the chair of Nissan’s board of directors, said in a news conference on Tuesday that it would be “a very challenging start” for Mr. Espinosa when he steps into the top job on April 1. But “given the industrywide challenges and Nissan’s performance, we believe it is necessary and appropriate to change the top management team,” Mr. Kimura said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nissan’s current leader, Mr. Uchida, 58, took charge during another turbulent period, after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/business/carlos-ghosn-nissan.html" title="">ouster</a> of Carlos Ghosn, then Nissan’s chairman, on allegations of financial misconduct. Nissan was reeling from a sharp decline in profits, and its leadership was in disarray. Mr. Uchida stepped up after Ghosn’s immediate successor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/business/nissan-ceo-hiroto-saikawa.html" title="">resigned</a> over separate issues involving his pay.</p><p>Mr. Uchida, who ran Nissan’s China business before taking the helm of the group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/business/nissan-renault-ghosn.html" title="">overhauled</a> its decades-old alliance with the French automaker Renault and embarked on a mission to boost profitability by scaling back incentives that had propped up sales during Mr. Ghosn’s tenure.</p><p>For a time, his strategy seemed to be working. Nissan reported healthy profits in 2022 and 2023, buoyed by a post-pandemic surge in demand and a favorable exchange rate. But the company’s aging portfolio of models struggled to keep up with shifting consumer preferences for hybrid and fully electric vehicles in some of its core markets.</p><p>That has been especially true in China, where local E.V.-wielding champions are increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/business/china-shanghai-auto-show.html" title="">outselling</a> smaller foreign brands. Nissan’s unit sales in China fell by more than 9 percent in the nine months through December. Struggling in other regions as well, Nissan cut its profit outlook three times in the current fiscal year.</p><p>In November, Mr. Uchida revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/nissan-job-cuts.html" title="">restructuring plans</a> that involved slashing Nissan’s global production capacity and cutting thousands of jobs. At the time, he said he felt responsible for the company’s failure to adapt to a fast-evolving market and volunteered to take a 50 percent pay cut.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Late last year, a potential lifeline emerged for Nissan: the possibility of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/business/honda-nissan-merger-talks.html" title="">merging</a> with Honda. The combined entity would have been one of the largest auto groups in the world. But less than two months after the companies began talks, the discussions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/honda-nissan-merger.html" title="">collapsed</a> because Nissan opposed a proposal from Honda that Nissan become its subsidiary.</p><p>The announcement last month that the merger talks had failed was made on the same day that Nissan reported declining sales and a nearly 90-percent plunge in operating profit, to $435 million, for the nine months ending in December.</p><p>Mr. Uchida said on Tuesday that he had tried to improve Nissan’s performance, but people inside and outside of the automaker had begun to question his role in the company’s lack of progress. “I deeply regret that I had to pass the baton to my successor in these circumstances,” Mr. Uchida said.</p><p>Mr. Espinosa, will not only confront the company’s existing problems, but new and potentially more challenging ones. Top among those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/carmakers-nissan-stellantis-tariffs.html" title="">threats</a> are President Trump’s proposed tariffs on cars imported from Japan, Canada and Mexico.</p><p>North America is by far Nissan’s largest market, and roughly a third of the nearly one million vehicles it sold in the United States last year were built in Mexico.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>During a hastily arranged news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Espinosa said little about how he plans to revive the automaker, saying repeatedly that he had just been informed of the board’s decision to appointment him as Nissan’s next chief.</p><p>What Mr. Espinosa does know, he said, “is that Nissan has so much more potential than what we are seeing today.” Asked about a potential reopening of talks with Honda about a merger, Mr. Espinosa declined to comment, saying instead that his focus was “getting Nissan’s teams engaged.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
