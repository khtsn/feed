Mr. Espinosa, 46, has held a number of roles related to product planning since he joined Nissan in 2003.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Uchida, 58, took charge during another turbulent period, after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/business/carlos-ghosn-nissan.html" title="">ouster</a> of Carlos Ghosn, then Nissan’s chairman, on allegations of financial misconduct. Nissan was reeling from a sharp decline in profits, and its leadership was in disarray. Mr. Uchida stepped up after Ghosn’s immediate successor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/business/nissan-ceo-hiroto-saikawa.html" title="">resigned</a> over separate issues involving his pay.</p><p>Mr. Uchida, who ran Nissan’s China business before taking the helm of the company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/business/nissan-renault-ghosn.html" title="">overhauled</a> its decades-old alliance with the French automaker Renault and embarked on a mission to boost profitability by scaling back incentives that had propped up sales during Mr. Ghosn’s tenure.</p><p>For a time, his strategy seemed to be working. Nissan reported healthy profits in 2022 and 2023, buoyed by a post-pandemic surge in demand and a favorable exchange rate. But the company’s aging model portfolio struggled to keep up with shifting consumer preferences for hybrid and fully electric vehicles in some of its core markets.</p><p>That has been especially true in China, where local E.V.-wielding champions are increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/business/china-shanghai-auto-show.html" title="">outselling</a> smaller foreign brands. Nissan’s unit sales in China fell by more than 9 percent in the nine months through December. Struggling in other regions as well, Nissan cut its profit outlook three times in the current fiscal year.</p><p>In November, Mr. Uchida revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/business/nissan-job-cuts.html" title="">restructuring plans</a> that involved slashing Nissan’s global production capacity and cutting thousands of jobs. At the time, he said he felt responsible for the company’s failure to adapt to a fast-evolving market and volunteered to take a 50 percent pay cut.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Late last year, a potential lifeline emerged for Nissan: the possibility of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/business/honda-nissan-merger-talks.html" title="">merging</a> with Honda. The combined entity would have been one of the largest auto groups in the world. But less than two months after the companies began talks, the discussions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/honda-nissan-merger.html" title="">collapsed</a> because Nissan opposed a proposal from Honda that Nissan become its subsidiary.</p><p>Now, Nissan faces a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/carmakers-nissan-stellantis-tariffs.html" title="">threat</a> in President Trump’s proposed tariffs on cars imported from Japan, Canada and Mexico. North America is still Nissan’s largest market, and the automaker would be particularly vulnerable to those tariffs. Roughly a third of the nearly one million vehicles it sold in the United States last year were built in Mexico.</p><p>Last month, Nissan reported a decline in global sales across its core markets, excluding North America, for the nine months ending in December. Its operating profit also plummeted nearly 90 percent, dropping to $435 million during the April-to-December period. Mr. Uchida warned that tariffs could have a “huge impact” on profits.</p><p>The turmoil in the auto industry has begun causing churn beyond Nissan. Other recent high-profile exits include that of Carlos Tavares, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/business/stellantis-ceo-resigns.html" title="">resigned</a> in December as Stellantis’s chief executive amid declining profits and sagging sales in North America.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
