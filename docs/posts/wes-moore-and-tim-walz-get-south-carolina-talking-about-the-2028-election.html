Wes Moore of Maryland played up his family ties to South Carolina and issued a spirited call to action as he addressed a room of Democrats hundreds of miles from home.</p><p>Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota told The New York Times that he liked the idea of holding the first-in-the-nation presidential primary election in South Carolina, and stressed that Democrats should show up in red states like this one.</p><p>The 2028 presidential campaign is years away, and virtually everything about it is uncertain. But in the eyes of some South Carolina Democrats who filed into the state party’s dinner on Friday night or headed to Representative James E. Clyburn’s annual fish fry nearby or showed up at Saturday’s party convention, the earliest stages of the primary race are plainly underway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Walz said he supported the idea that South Carolina would stay at the front of the nominating calendar. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Travis Dove for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>And to them, just one question really matters: Who can win a general election?</p><p>“South Carolina Democrats don’t want to waste their vote,” said former Gov. Jim Hodges, the last Democrat to lead the state. “It’s very important that the candidates have a little swagger and confidence and that they lay out a persuasive case for how they can win.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Indeed, interviews with roughly a dozen elected officials and party activists who were in Columbia last week show that at this early stage, some are already inclined toward the kind of punditry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/25/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-republicans.html" title="">that dominated</a> the 2020 primary campaign, viewing potential candidates through the prism of their general-election appeal.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Moore had several events lined up in South Carolina, which is traditionally an early presidential nominating state.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Travis Dove for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Walz and Mr. Moore, of course, are not currently presidential candidates — not that anyone was buying their 2028 brush-offs. (“They wouldn’t be here if they weren’t interested,” Mr. Hodges said.)</p><p>The order of the next presidential primary calendar is also unknown, though some in South Carolina are strategizing about how to lock in former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/us/politics/biden-dnc-primary-south-carolina-2024.html" title="">move to put their state first</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Yet Mr. Moore — who is up for re-election next year in Maryland and keeps insisting to reporters, in the present tense, that he is “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_UjWRanWP14" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not running</a>” for president — sounded more like a national candidate during his 30-minute address on Friday night at the annual Blue Palmetto dinner.</p><p>He walked the audience through his record in Maryland and introduced himself as the grandson of a Charleston native who had “South Carolina grit all through his bones” and the great-grandson of a minister who had been threatened by the Ku Klux Klan in the state.</p><p>Public records, however, indicate that the grandfather in question was born in Greenville County, S.C., which is across the state from Charleston. Asked on Saturday about that discrepancy, Mr. Moore expressed surprise before adding: “Then maybe it is Greenville. My mother told me Charleston.”</p><p>At the dinner on Friday, Mr. Moore cast himself as an action-oriented pragmatist, suggesting that his party should respond with urgency to President Trump and offer its own affirmative vision.</p><p>“Gone are the days when the Democrats are the party of ‘no’ and ‘slow,’” he said. “We must be the party of ‘yes’ and ‘now.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He received a warm and attentive, if not raucous, reception. One of his best-received lines, in an audience with many Black attendees, was among the most personal.</p><p>“They are banning books about our history because they know if you know your history, you know your power,” said Mr. Moore, the nation’s only Black governor. “I know my power, and that is why I know every room that I’m in, I’m not there because of someone’s benevolence.”</p><p>“I’m in that room,” he added, “because I belong there.”</p><p>Mr. Moore, who cautioned that “anybody who is talking about 2028 doesn’t understand the urgency of 2025,” had several events lined up in the state, including official meetings on economic development. But he also mingled with prominent South Carolinians in other settings, joining Jaime Harrison, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, to record for a podcast Mr. Harrison is starting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Moore introduced himself at the dinner as the grandson of a Charleston native who had “South Carolina grit all through his bones.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Travis Dove for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>He was scheduled to attend a brunch on Saturday with business, political and faith leaders at the home of Rick C. Wade, an executive at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/us/politics/02race.html" title="">early adviser</a> to Barack Obama during the 2008 campaign, Mr. Wade confirmed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mr. Walz, for his part, was speaking at fund-raisers for the state party and attended a private reception for major party activists at the home of Carol Fowler, a Democratic National Committeewoman from South Carolina, according to an attendee.</p><p>“It’s an important state not just because it’s an early primary state,” Mr. Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told reporters on Friday night on the sidelines of Mr. Clyburn’s fish fry, where attendees dined on crispy filets with white bread and braved long lines at the bar. “It’s an important state because I think we’ve made mistakes in not focusing across the country.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Walz talking at the dinner with Mr. Clyburn, a powerful Democrat in the state.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Travis Dove for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>On Saturday, he delivered an energetic keynote address at the state convention, encouraging his party to embrace “big, bold ideas” while also challenging Mr. Trump.</p><p>“Losing an election is an opportunity to reflect,” he said. “But it damn sure better be an opportunity to fight a little harder coming back the next time.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In an interview, Mr. Clyburn — a powerful state figure — suggested it was impossible to game out 2028 without knowing what the political environment would be then. But he still offered some broader analysis of the speakers.</p><p>“Wes Moore, I think, would be attractive — he’s a real good crossover candidate,” he said. “Tim Walz is my kind of a governor, and I have found throughout my life that there is a real kinship between the South and the Midwest.”</p><p>He spoke warmly about a few other ambitious Democrats, including Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois (“his sister Penny and I are good friends”), Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania (“Shapiro and I are good buddies”). He said Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky had given a powerful speech when they appeared together recently in Selma, Ala.</p><p>Yet for all the 2028 buzz, Democrats face far more urgent questions about what went wrong in 2024, how to respond to Mr. Trump and how to rebuild a diminished party.</p><p>In an interview before the weekend events, Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a veteran Democratic state representative, shrugged off presidential chatter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>She said she was trying “to convince Democrats that we need to have a message that will help us with candidate recruitment,” especially locally.</p><p>“It’s not enough to say, ‘We are not the other guy,’” she said. “That’s not a winning message.”</p><p>Nationally, some Democrats have also argued that left-wing activists and groups have pushed candidates to take positions in primary races that are untenable in general elections. In 2019, Kamala Harris took numerous progressive stances in her unsuccessful primary campaign that became significant problems when she ran last year as the Democratic nominee.</p><p>“We ought to be very particular, very careful, and think very strategically about the kind of candidates that we will nominate,” said Darrell Jackson, a Democratic state senator in South Carolina. “Sometimes we overly emphasize issues that have proven to be liabilities for us with the general election.”</p><p>Some in the party also quietly wonder whether a country that twice elected Mr. Trump over female nominees would support a Democratic woman for president in 2028. Maybe, this whispered argument goes, it would be safer to nominate a man.</p><p>“I would say to those people, no Black person could get elected president of the United States until Barack Obama did,” Mr. Clyburn said. “I don’t know when that will be, but I think a woman can get elected. The question is when.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Clyburn said in an interview that he supported keeping South Carolina in the early primary window but was open to the order of the calendar.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Travis Dove for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>In 2020, Mr. Clyburn helped revive Mr. Biden’s primary campaign by endorsing him in South Carolina.

Mr. Clyburn said he wanted to keep South Carolina in the early primary window but felt less strongly about the precise order.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Walz went further, saying he supported the idea of South Carolina remaining first.</p><p>“I’m glad we switched it up,” he said. “You have to have that diversity of representation.
