More than five million people have been ordered to find safer ground before Milton makes landfall tomorrow, causing a mass exodus that has clogged the highways and drained the area’s gas stations.</p><p>The storm is headed for the Tampa Bay region, a metro area that is highly vulnerable to storm surge and hasn’t had a direct hit from a major hurricane since 1921. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/weather/milton-map-path-tracker.html" title="">Here’s a live look at Milton’s projected path</a>.</p><p>President Biden, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/biden-trip-hurricane-milton.html" title="">canceled a foreign trip</a> to oversee the government response to Milton, urged Floridians to “evacuate now, now, now.” FEMA is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/climate/hurricane-milton-fema-staff-shortage.html" title="">already stretched thin</a>, but Gov. Ron DeSantis said that Biden had approved everything he’d asked for.</p><p>For many residents, the storm is a demoralizing second punch after Hurricane Helene flooded the region. My colleague Patricia Mazzei, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/weather/hurricane-milton-helene-evacuations.html" title="">who is reporting from the area</a>, watched the Florida National Guard rushing to remove debris from Helene that could become dangerous in the winds from Milton.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kent Nishimura for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-31e5e622">The Supreme Court seemed open to limits on ‘ghost guns’</h2><p>A majority of the Supreme Court justices appeared sympathetic during oral arguments today to the Biden administration’s regulations on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/ghost-guns-supreme-court.html" title="">kits that allow people to make untraceable homemade guns</a>.</p><p>The case centers on whether federal regulators acted lawfully when they restricted “ghost guns” — which can be purchased online and easily assembled in less than an hour — after they surged in popularity. At least five justices, including the conservative justices John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett, seemed to favor the limits.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The ghost guns case is the first of a handful of major cases that the Supreme Court will hear this term, including a case on transgender rights and another gun dispute. The docket has returned to a sort of normalcy after a few momentous years, my colleague Adam Liptak explained, but that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/supreme-court-term-transgender-rights.html" title="">could change fast if the presidential race is contested</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4c7e0ace">A new book says Trump secretly stayed in touch with Putin</h2><p>Donald Trump secretly spoke with President Vladimir Putin as many as seven times after leaving office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/trump-putin-woodward-book.html" title="">according to a new book</a> by the journalist Bob Woodward. The book also reports that Trump, while still in office during the pandemic, quietly sent Putin what were then rare Covid test machines for personal use.</p><p>Efforts by my colleagues to confirm the communications were not successful. Nineteen current and former Trump and Biden administration officials and career intelligence officials we spoke to said they had no knowledge of contacts between Trump and Putin after Trump left office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Anselm for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-45a4969d">The U.S. required lead pipes to be replaced</h2><p>The Biden administration unveiled a landmark rule today that would require water utilities to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/climate/biden-epa-lead-pipes.html" title="">replace virtually every lead pipe in the country within 10 years</a>.
