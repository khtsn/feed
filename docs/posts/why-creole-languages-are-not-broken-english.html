    <h1>Why Creole Languages Are Not Broken English</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>I spent last week in Australia, and had some experiences that made the trip well worth the long flight. I devoured what I am reasonably sure is the best lamb meat pie on earth, I saw an echidna and I had some illuminating conversations about linguistics with professors and students. In one of those conversations, I learned about a language kerfuffle from a few years ago that took me back to the 1990s, and reminded me of how beautiful and complex nonstandard speech can be.</p><p>In 2021, Mark McGowan, who was then the premier of Western Australia, made a <a href="https://multilingual.com/aboriginal-kriol-interpreter/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> informing Aboriginal people about safety precautions during the Covid-19 pandemic. He stood next to an Aboriginal interpreter, who translated his statements into Kriol, the language many Aboriginal people in Australia speak. So, for instance, when McGowan said, “This is an important message to keep Aboriginal people safe,” it was followed by the interpreter saying, “Dijan message i proper important-one to keep-im everybody safe-one.”</p><p>Commentary in and out of Australia was mean, calling it racist and condescending for McGowan to have statements directed at Aboriginal people translated into mere baby talk. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giJ--ZGNWf0&amp;t=19s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Typical</a> was “This isn’t a mix of languages, this is just ignorant usage of English. Apparently saying this is ‘bad English’ is racist, but I guess I’m a racist because this is just bad English.”</p><p>The dust-up revealed that even in Australia, many people are unaware that Aboriginal people have transformed English into a new language entirely. To many people, the idea that Kriol is a legitimate form of speech is unfamiliar, and even absurd. It reminded me of the American public’s reaction to Ebonics — i.e., Black English — in 1996, when the school board in Oakland, Calif., <a href="https://kappanonline.org/russo-ebonics-coverage-65649-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that Black children would learn to read more easily if Black English were presented alongside standard English as a teaching strategy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In both cases, people miss that nonstandard speech is not, in any scientific sense, substandard. These forms of speech are not broken. In fact, there is order, subtlety, and even majesty in these ways of talking.</p><p>When colonizing Australia, the English encountered Indigenous people speaking many languages. A makeshift pidgin emerged for use between them and the white people, using English words mixed with some from the local languages, and just enough grammatical structure — a mere sprinkle — to allow basic communication. This was not a real, distinct language.</p><p>But over time, Aboriginal groups started using it to communicate with one another. They needed it to evolve from an improvised, utilitarian tool for trade into a fuller means of self-expression. So they filled it out with more words. They added real grammar, some rules derived from their Indigenous languages and others emerging on their own, negotiated through usage, marking things like tense and number. They started to speak it faster, and passed it on to their children. This is how pidgin in Australia became Kriol, a real language. And this is the process by which other Creole languages were constructed: Papiamentu, Jamaican patois, Haitian Creole and dozens of other languages worldwide.</p><p>In the video, Kriol is used slowly, one sentence at a time, expressing rather elementary concepts, which helped give viewers the mistaken impression that it was just corrupted English. But that’s not how it, or any language, is used in everyday communication. Here is a more representative Kriol <a href="https://apics-online.info/surveys/25" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sentence</a>: “Dijan lilboi gemen im-in gedim long-wan stik en pukum la jad hol.” This is hardly baby-talk English, given that it is so hard to even glean what the baby in question would even be saying. It means, “This little boy got a long stick and pushed it down into the hole.”</p><p>“Dijan” — roughly pronounced “DEE-jun” — is what happens when you say “this one” repeatedly across generations. It is now unrecognizable as derived from “this one” except with study. It is a word of its own just as “daisy” is a different word from what it started as, “day’s eye.” The “la jad hol” at the end of the sentence is “to that hole.” “Jad” is “that” after the same process that made “this one” into “dijan.” “La” is “to” for reasons that need not detain us, but obviously no baby says “la” for “to”! The word “gemen” signifies that this sentence is describing something from a dream, based on the old British word “gammon,” for “inauthentic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>So, more closely examined, to hear Kriol as broken English is like thinking of lamb as broken beef. Kriol is very much its own thing, a separate language from English, such that Aboriginal people who use both English and Kriol are bilingual (and often trilingual, when they also speak their native Indigenous languages, of which there were once more than 250 in Australia).</p><p>It’s easy to hear Black English in the same way as many Australians hear this Kriol. Many will recall the endless Ebonics <a href="https://funehumor.com/fun_doc0/fun_0011.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jokes</a> that circulated in the late 1990s. (An Ebonics-speaking student asked to use “beware” in a sentence writes: “I asked the man at the unemployment office, ‘Is this beware I get a job?’”) America feasted on the idea of teaching street slang in the classroom, happily recalling the scene in the film “Airplane!” when a white woman offers to translate two Black men speaking “jive.”</p><p>I sense that three decades on, we have gotten somewhat past this. Black English gets a little more respect than it used to. This is partly because of the teachings of the public-facing linguist, who is more common nowadays than then — because social media makes it easier to be one. The mainstreaming of hip-hop has also played a role.</p><p>But it’s one thing to hear Black English as expressive, dynamic, cultural — i.e., cool. It’s another thing to understand that it’s complicated, with rules and intricacies, like Arabic, Latin and Thai. Just as with Kriol, because it is based on English and we are taught to worship the standard dialect as the “real” one, Black English can seem unruly, abbreviated.</p><p>Take this humble sentence: “We woulda <em>been</em> done ate.” From the perspective of standard English, the “<em>been</em> done” may seem — albeit slangy or even vibrant — grammatically … askew?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It isn’t. The “done” is the equivalent of English’s perfect with “have,” as in “Elvis has left the building,” which we use to express when something that happened in the past still has resonance now. The sentence above was uttered within a context of immediate urgency: “If you all hadn’t went out somewhere, we woulda <em>been</em> done ate.” Then, in Black English, when “been” is used with an accent on it in that way, actually pronounced more like “bin,” it’s grammar, not some kind of, as it were, coloring. It allows the speaker to distinguish between the recent past and the more distant past. “We woulda <em>been</em> done ate” means that we would have eaten a long time ago.</p><p>That sentence is from Elizabeth Dayton’s magisterial Ph.D. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9j1fxn3qd33vv43fmx2p6/Dayton_1996.pdf?rlkey=y4lruezx1rzj2hp9me2akk7ss&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dissertation</a> on how verbs work in Black English. It clocks in at 1,057 pages, such that anyone who thinks Black English is just broken rules should consult — or at least behold — it.</p><p>Humans are hard-wired for complex language. Children, if raised on anything less, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~as1038/about-nsl.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">create</a> a complex language out of what they hear. Linguists and anthropologists have recorded no humans speaking language that fails to fulfill all communicative needs. I hope the folks Down Under will come to understand that Kriol is one of their national treasures just as Black English is one of ours.</p><p><strong>Incidentally, on the marvels</strong> <strong>of speaking,</strong> there is a neat new book on the horizon teaching us how talking develops kids’ minds, how it should be more central to education than just listening quietly, how it can help us organize our thoughts and calm ourselves down, and even hold off dementia. In Maryellen MacDonald’s “More Than Words: How Talking Sharpens the Mind and Shapes Our World,” you get the sense of casual speech as awesome that I was just trying to get across.</p><hr/></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John McWhorter (<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnHMcWhorter">@JohnHMcWhorter</a>) is an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University.
