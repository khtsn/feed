Thousands of Democratic delegates, on hand to hear Kamala Harris accept her party’s nomination, chanted “USA! USA!” as they sang along to “Texas Hold ’Em” by Beyoncé and “Born in the USA” by Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>And they rose to their feet as the Chicks came out to sing the national anthem.</p><p>It was a final night of the Democratic National Convention, a choreographed display that offered powerful evidence of the party’s intention to appropriate what has been a defining symbol of Republican campaigns since Richard M. Nixon won the White House in the midst of the Vietnam War in 1968: patriotism and love of country.</p><p>From the appearance of Olympic gold medal heroes, symbols of American success, to Ms. Harris’s speech proclaiming the “privilege and pride of being an American,” there seemed little doubt that Democrats were intent on showing that Republicans are not the only party that can wrap itself in the American flag.</p><p>“For everyone here and everyone watching, I want you to proudly claim your patriotism,” said Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. “You are here because you love your country. Do not give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag but spit in the face of freedoms it represents.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Republicans have long sought to use patriotism as a weapon against Democrats, and often with success. Nixon in 1968 assailed the party for the opposition to what he described as the battle against Communist forces in the Vietnam War. President George W. Bush challenged the war record of his Democratic challenger, John Kerry, in 2004. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, routinely hugs the American flag at his events.</p><p>An attack on Harris’s patriotism could have particular resonance in some corners of the country, Democrats say. As a Black woman, Ms. Harris faces stereotypes that white politicians don’t. She was raised largely the San Francisco Bay Area, a part of the country long identified with leftist politics and antiwar protests.</p><p>Ms. Harris’s speech on Thursday aimed to rebut those biases — and turn attention to her rival.</p><p>“You can always trust me to put country before party and self,” she said, referring to Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn his defeat in 2020. “To hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power.”</p><p>The Democrats’ convention borrowed heavily on the patriotic spirit of the Olympics. Steve Kerr, the United States men’s basketball coach, spoke to the delegates earlier this week. Stephen Curry, a basketball all-star who carried Team USA to a gold medal this summer, popped up on the Jumbotron wearing his medal as he endorsed her.</p><p>“This is about preserving hope and belief in our country,” he said. “It’s been an honor for me to represent our country. It’s an honor to support Kamala Harris.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The effort to inoculate Ms. Harris has been an undercurrent from this campaign almost from the beginning. Ms. Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have repeatedly talked about freedom as a patriotic value.</p><p>The song “Freedom” by Beyoncé has become the anthem of the Harris campaign, and it played over the speakers at the end of her speech on Thursday.</p><p>But the most striking example of this came at the end of the night. As Ms. Harris finished speaking, red, white and blue balloons and cutout stars tumbled from the ceiling while members of the audience hoisted large American flags, waving them back and forth,</p><p>“It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done — guided by optimism and faith to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American,” she said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
