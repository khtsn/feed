Powell</a>.</p><p>Gold has set a series of records during an ugly stretch for the markets. Its latest peak came after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.html" title="">particularly rough day on Wall Street</a>, when investors dumped stocks, sold <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/bond-market-tariffs-trump.html" title="">U.S. Treasury bonds</a> and cut their exposure to the dollar, causing its value to drop against most other major currencies.</p><p>Gold is often sought out by investors as a safe haven during times of turmoil, and its price has surged more than 30 percent since the start of the year.</p><p>“Gold has again moved to yet another record, with its safe-haven reputation shining bright,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets. “With the uncertainty related to Fed independence, gold continues to benefit as a safe-haven, and one not tied to the U.S. dollar.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Gold has been soaring since early April when investors, alarmed by Mr. Trump’s tariffs, starting selling Treasury bonds. On Tuesday, the spot price of a troy ounce of gold briefly reached above $3,500 before slipping lower.</p><p>Elsewhere in the markets:</p><ul><li><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 1 percent at the start of trading, reversing some of Monday’s sell-off. European and Asian markets were broadly lower on Tuesday.</p></li><li><p>The dollar, which slumped on Monday against a range of currencies, was having another turbulent day, losing ground to the yen but recovering against the euro. The dollar has fallen against the British pound for 10 days in a row; an 11th on Tuesday would be the longest streak since at least 1971, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-22/ftse-100-live-trump-tariffs-dollar-pound-what-s-moving-uk-markets-right-now-markets-today?cursorId=68073F1AB21C0000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p></li><li><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell slightly, to 4.38 percent.</p></li><li><p>The Trump administration’s whiplash on trade policy continues to drive volatility in the markets and weigh on companies. “The level of uncertainty is too high.
