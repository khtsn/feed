Powell</a>.</p><p>Gold has set a series of records during an ugly stretch for the markets. Its latest peak came after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.html" title="">particularly rough day on Wall Street</a>, when investors dumped stocks, sold <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/bond-market-tariffs-trump.html" title="">U.S. Treasury bonds</a> and cut their exposure to the dollar, causing its value to drop against most other major currencies.</p><p>Gold is often sought out by investors as a safe haven during times of turmoil, and its price has surged more than 30 percent since the start of the year.</p><p>“Gold has again moved to yet another record, with its safe-haven reputation shining bright,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets. “With the uncertainty related to Fed independence, gold continues to benefit as a safe-haven, and one not tied to the U.S. dollar.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Gold has been soaring since early April when investors, alarmed by Mr. Trump’s tariffs, starting selling Treasury bonds.

European and Asian markets were broadly lower on Tuesday.</p></li><li><p>The dollar, which slumped on Monday against a range of currencies, was having another turbulent day, losing ground to the yen but recovering against the euro. The dollar has fallen against the British pound for 10 days in a row; an 11th on Tuesday would be the longest streak since at least 1971, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-22/ftse-100-live-trump-tariffs-dollar-pound-what-s-moving-uk-markets-right-now-markets-today?cursorId=68073F1AB21C0000" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p></li><li><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell slightly, to 4.38 percent.</p></li><li><p>The Trump administration’s whiplash on trade policy continues to drive volatility in the markets and weigh on companies. “The level of uncertainty is too high. It’s not productive,” David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. “It’s affecting investment spending and planning, and that will have an effect on growth in the economy,” he added.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Deactivated from Delivery Work:</strong> Millions of Americans earn money finding gig work through platforms like Uber, Lyft or DoorDash.
