    <h1>Columbia Activist’s Case Goes to Court</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Outside a Manhattan courthouse today, hundreds of protesters gathered to criticize the Trump administration’s plan to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate who helped lead protests there against Israel. Inside, a judge said he would grant Khalil’s lawyers the ability to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-detention-hearing.html" title="">speak with him privately for the first time since he was arrested</a> and sent to immigration detention in Louisiana.</p><p>The case is at the center of President Trump’s effort to expel foreign students who took part in last year’s campus protests over the war in Gaza. After months of threatening deportations, Trump celebrated the arrest of Khalil, a legal permanent resident with a green card, as the first of “many to come.”</p><p>Behind the scenes, federal investigators who typically focus on human traffickers and drug smugglers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-crackdown-dissent.html" title="">searching social media for posts showing protesters’ sympathy toward Hamas</a>. The authorities have not accused Khalil of having any contact with the terrorist group or providing material support to it. Instead, Trump’s aides are arguing that he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/mahmoud-khalil-legal-resident-deportation.html" title="">organized antisemitic activities on campus</a>, which makes him deportable under an obscure legal statute.</p><p>“This is not about free speech,” Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, said today. “This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card.” Trump’s critics argue that Khalil’s pending deportation is a clear violation of the First Amendment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate Democrats.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-4b075554">The federal government edged closer to a shutdown</h2><p>Senate Democrats will not help Republicans pass a bill to fund the government through Sept. 30, according to Chuck Schumer, the party’s leader in the chamber.
