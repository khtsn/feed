The contaminant is found in the feces of animals and humans, according to the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm?Product=213218" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>.</p><p>The recall was initiated after “finished-product testing revealing an elevated level of coliform bacteria,” Agri-Mark, the parent company, <a href="https://cabotcreamery.com/blogs/community/agri-mark-inc-issues-voluntary-recall-of-cabot-8oz-extra-creamy-premium-butter-sea-salted" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>The F.D.A. said the recalled butter was distributed in Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. The white-and-black packages are marked with a best-by date of Sept. 9, 2025, and the lot number 090925-055.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The company said only 17 packages of the butter, or 34 sticks, were sold at retail outlets, all in Vermont. No other Cabot products were affected.</p><p>“Agri-Mark successfully recovered 99.5 percent of the lot of the recalled product before it was sold to consumers,” the company said.</p><p>On Tuesday, the F.D.A. labeled the recall a Class III, which means the health risk to consumers was relatively low.</p><p>“There have been no reported complaints or illnesses related to this product,” the company said. “Agri-Mark is dedicated to food safety and producing quality products and is always monitoring its products for compliance.”</p><p>Coliform bacteria are found in the digestive tracts of people and animals, as well as in soil, on plants and in lakes and rivers, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drinking-water/safety/guidelines-for-testing-well-water.html#:~:text=If%20the%20total%20coliform%20count,water%20like%20lakes%20or%20rivers." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. However, “these bacteria generally will not make you sick,” the agency said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The company’s statement did not include recommendations for what steps consumers should follow. But generally with this type of recall, the safest option is to throw the recalled product away.</p></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-5"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Johnny Diaz is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news from Miami.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/food-and-drug-administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/nyregion">New York</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Control via Confidentiality:</strong> Bryan Johnson — a longevity guru and the founder of Blueprint — has wielded confidentiality agreements to control his image and the companies he built atop it.
