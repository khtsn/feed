    <h1>How to Watch the New York Mets, Liberty and Jets Games Tonight</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frank Guridy, a professor at Columbia University who studies sports history, said that while there have been other moments when several New York teams were competing at a high level at the same time, “what makes this moment unique is that women’s sports is probably more popular than ever.”</p><p>“There’s been no analogous moment in women’s sports history” in the city, he said in an email.</p><p>The Liberty, after losing last year’s W.N.B.A. finals on their home court, dropped only eight games in a dominant season that saw them cruise to the finals behind career-best play from the star guard Sabrina Ionescu, including a last-second three-pointer to win Game 3 of this series.</p><p>After losing an opportunity to clinch the title, 82-80, to the Lynx on Friday, the Liberty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/nyregion/new-york-liberty-finals.html" title="">now look to win in front of their home crowd</a> (and their beloved mascot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/style/ellie-elephant-ny-liberty-wnba.html" title="">Ellie the Elephant</a>).</p><p>New York fans of other sports will also have something to root for on Sunday, with local teams active across seven leagues. Even if the Mets and the Liberty lose, Gotham F.C. remains on the hunt for its second straight N.W.S.L. title, the Rangers are off to a strong start in the N.H.L. and the men’s basketball season is underway with the Knicks looking to build on last year’s playoff run.</p><p>Here’s how to watch:</p><ul><li><p>New York/New Jersey Gotham F.C. vs. Orlando Pride: 5 p.m. on ESPN</p></li><li><p>New York Liberty vs. Minnesota Lynx: 8 p.m. on ESPN</p></li><li><p>New York Mets at Los Angeles Dodgers: 8:08 p.m. on FS1</p></li><li><p>New York Jets at Pittsburgh Steelers: 8:20 p.m. on NBC</p></li></ul></div></div>
