    <h1>How to Watch the New York Mets, Liberty and Jets Games Tonight</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sunday night will have a lineup that New York sports fans could hardly have imagined even a few months ago, with two championships on the line and a prime-time reunion of two of football’s biggest names.</p><p>The Mets face a win-or-go-home matchup against the Dodgers in Los Angeles; the Liberty will look to win the city’s first basketball title since 1976 in Brooklyn against the Minnesota Lynx; and quarterback Aaron Rodgers and star receiver Davante Adams will play their first game together since their Green Bay days when the Jets take on the Steelers in Pittsburgh.</p><p>For the Mets and the Liberty, the games are opportunities to redeem themselves after several close brushes with championship victory over the past few years. For the Jets, who are 2-4 so far this season, Sunday night will be a chance to end a hapless streak and prove themselves to be playoff contenders.</p><p>The Mets, in their 62nd season, had the third-worst record in the National League on May 29. Then, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/new-york-mets.html" title="">remarkable turnaround</a>, they went 62-35 and won a wild-card slot to clinch a playoff berth after missing the postseason last year. The Mets are down 2-3 in the seven-game league championship series. If they can make a comeback, they will face the Yankees — who are headed to the World Series after a 5-2 victory over the Guardians on Saturday — in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/nyregion/yankees-mets-new-york-fans.html" title="">first Subway Series</a> since 2000.</p></div></div>
