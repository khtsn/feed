The Mets are down 2-3 in the seven-game league championship series. If they can make a comeback, they will face the Yankees — who are headed to the World Series after a 5-2 victory over the Guardians on Saturday — in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/nyregion/yankees-mets-new-york-fans.html" title="">first Subway Series</a> since 2000.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Liberty, after losing last year’s W.N.B.A. finals on their home court, dropped only eight games in a dominant season that saw them cruise to the finals behind career-best play from the star guard Sabrina Ionescu, including a last-second three-pointer to win Game 3 of this series.</p><p>After losing an opportunity to clinch the title, 82-80, to the Lynx on Friday, the Liberty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/nyregion/new-york-liberty-finals.html" title="">now look to win in front of their home crowd</a> (and their beloved mascot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/style/ellie-elephant-ny-liberty-wnba.html" title="">Ellie the Elephant</a>).</p><p>Here’s how to watch:</p><ul><li><p>New York Liberty vs. Minnesota Lynx: 8 p.m. on ESPN</p></li><li><p>New York Mets at Los Angeles Dodgers: 8:08 p.m. on FS1</p></li><li><p>New York Jets at Pittsburgh Steelers: 8:20 p.m. on NBC</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Fahy reports on New York City and the surrounding area for The Times.
