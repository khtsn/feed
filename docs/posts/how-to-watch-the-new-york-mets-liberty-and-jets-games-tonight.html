For the Jets, who are 2-4 so far this season, Sunday night will be a chance to end a hapless streak and prove themselves to be playoff contenders.</p><p>Neil Bellevue, 37, grew up in Rockland County, about 30 miles north of the city, and said he first got into New York sports as a way to bond with his father, a Haitian immigrant who worked six days a week and spent his downtime watching games. One of Mr. Bellevue’s favorite childhood sports memories, he said, was the Rangers’ winning the Stanley Cup in 1994.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He said he was ready for New York to have an era like Boston, whose teams have won a combined 13 championships in the past 24 years, including last season’s N.B.A. title, which went to the Celtics.</p><p>“I think our time is now for New York sports,” he said.</p><p>The Mets, in their 62nd season, had the third-worst record in the National League on May 29. Then, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/new-york-mets.html" title="">remarkable turnaround</a>, they went 62-35 and won a wild-card slot to clinch a playoff berth after missing the postseason last year. The Mets are down 2-3 in the seven-game league championship series. If they can make a comeback, they will face the Yankees — who are headed to the World Series after a 5-2 victory over the Guardians on Saturday — in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/nyregion/yankees-mets-new-york-fans.html" title="">first Subway Series</a> since 2000.</p><p>Frank Guridy, a professor at Columbia University who studies sports history, said that while there have been other moments when several New York teams were competing at a high level at the same time, “what makes this moment unique is that women’s sports is probably more popular than ever.”</p><p>“There’s been no analogous moment in women’s sports history” in the city, he said in an email.</p><p>The Liberty, after losing last year’s W.N.B.A. finals on their home court, dropped only eight games in a dominant season that saw them cruise to the finals behind career-best play from the star guard Sabrina Ionescu, including a last-second three-pointer to win Game 3 of this series.</p><p>After losing an opportunity to clinch the title, 82-80, to the Lynx on Friday, the Liberty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/nyregion/new-york-liberty-finals.html" title="">now look to win in front of their home crowd</a> (and their beloved mascot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/style/ellie-elephant-ny-liberty-wnba.html" title="">Ellie the Elephant</a>).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mary Emma Heald, 27, wore a Liberty hat on her walk through the Upper East Side of Manhattan on Sunday. “I’m a fairly new women’s basketball fan,” she said, “but the energy it’s brought to the city has been really exciting.”</p><p>Ms. Heald, who is from Atlanta and roots for the Braves in baseball, added that she has nonetheless felt inspired by the Mets’ recent success.</p><p>New York fans of other sports will also have something to root for on Sunday, with local teams active across seven leagues. Even if the Mets and the Liberty lose, Gotham F.C. remains on the hunt for its second straight N.W.S.L. title, the Rangers are off to a strong start in the N.H.L. and the men’s basketball season is underway with the Knicks looking to build on last year’s playoff run.</p><p>“I think that gives us hope,” Mr. Bellevue said. “It’s a distraction, because with everything going on this world, having New York sports be back the way it is right now, it really is an uplifting thing.”</p><p>Here’s how to watch:</p><ul><li><p>New York/New Jersey Gotham F.C. vs. Orlando Pride: 5 p.m. on ESPN</p></li><li><p>New York Liberty vs. Minnesota Lynx: 8 p.m. on ESPN</p></li><li><p>New York Mets at Los Angeles Dodgers: 8:08 p.m. on FS1</p></li><li><p>New York Jets at Pittsburgh Steelers: 8:20 p.m. on NBC</p></li></ul></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Fahy reports on New York City and the surrounding area for The Times.
