    <h1>In ‘Empty Beds,’ a Stark Reminder of War’s Youngest Victims</h1>

A 100-foot-long mural shows children’s beds lined with stuffed animals and toys, but no children, symbolizing the thousands of Ukrainian children who were separated or taken from their families since Russia invaded their country in 2022.</p><p>The piece, titled “Empty Beds, is an eight-foot-tall photographic installation by the artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pwbuehler/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phil Buehler</a>. It was officially introduced on Saturday, when children tugged their parents closer to look at the cuddly toys, while other visitors sat on yellow folding chairs nearby to reflect.</p><p>The mural, on display until Nov. 30 at 44 Second Avenue (at East Second Street), uses the visual language of absence to signify the continuing war in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Buehler photographed the beds at eye level to draw viewers into the intimate spaces filled. “I wanted to place viewers in the perspective of the children themselves,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/multimedia/29empty-beds--01-bglp/29empty-beds--01-bglp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/multimedia/29empty-beds--01-bglp/29empty-beds--01-bglp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/multimedia/29empty-beds--01-bglp/29empty-beds--01-bglp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A child’s cradle with pink bumper cushions, a gray polka-dot blanket and five stuffed animals." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/multimedia/29empty-beds--01-bglp/29empty-beds--01-bglp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/multimedia/29empty-beds--01-bglp/29empty-beds--01-bglp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/multimedia/29empty-beds--01-bglp/29empty-beds--01-bglp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/29/multimedia/29empty-beds--01-bglp/29empty-beds--01-bglp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a1ca2376-c54a-5abf-8d96-fd52450f390f" decoding="async" width="600" height="484"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Bed of Hanna” in the exhibition “Empty Beds” in Little Ukraine.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Buehler</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>One striking image shows Rostislav Lavrov’s bed, with a Yankees baseball cap hanging from its edge. Taken by Russian soldiers from his home in Kherson when he was 16, he was transported through multiple camps in occupied Crimea, where he faced constant pressure to renounce his Ukrainian citizenship. After months of forced relocation and isolation, he made a daring escape across a neutral border zone into Ukrainian-controlled territory. He <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/08/1228453066/taken-by-russia-then-rescued-young-ukrainians-speak-out" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later testified to the U.S. Congress</a>.</p><p>Rostislav’s bed is in temporary housing; originally, Buehler planned to photograph the bedrooms of children who are still missing, but war crime investigations in Ukraine prevented his access. </p><p>Instead, the photos in the installation, taken outside Kyiv, in Tarasivka and Hatne, show the personal belongings of children who have returned, such as stuffed animals, toys and, in Rostislav’s case, a baseball cap and his clothes. </p><p>Iryna Rozdolska, a visitor to the mural, said: “I usually try to block out difficult stories from Ukraine, just to keep myself steady for my kids. But this time, I allowed myself to feel, and I felt both pain and hope as I watched people pause to understand these stories.” She added that her 7-year-old son was particularly affected, saying repeatedly, “I feel so sad for those kids.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Bed of Rostislav Lavrov,”  top bunk.

The pictures serve as a somber reminder: Nearly <a href="https://childrenofwar.gov.ua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20,000 children</a> have been abducted, with many still unaccounted for, according to the Children of War portal, a project supported by the Ukrainian government. Just <a href="https://childrenofwar.gov.ua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">388</a> children have been safely returned after being taken to Russia or Russian-controlled territories. </p><p>The installation also features interactive elements. Visitors can hold and touch stuffed animals, and listen to Ukrainian lullabies.</p><p>“The lullabies are sweet and soothing,” Buehler said. “But when you realize they’re meant for children who were abducted or displaced by war, the meaning shifts, becoming much more poignant.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The artist Phil Buehler in front of a child’s painting of clouds and rainbows.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clark Hodgin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Buehler, 68, has been making art for the last <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/opinion/ellis-island-immigration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;tgrp=ctr&amp;pvid=5B7F0267-F44D-40FD-BD2A-FE31ACC4810F" title="">five decades</a>, including large-scale installations, documentary-style photography and films addressing political issues. His past work includes<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/nov/08/the-wall-of-liars-and-deniers-trump-fake-election-rhetoric" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> “Wall of Lies</a>,” from 2020, a 50-foot-long banner displaying misleading statements made by Donald Trump and other people regarding the legitimacy of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Buehler refers to this type of work as cycloramas, intended to create a 360-degree viewing experience.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The idea for “Empty Beds” came from a deeply personal moment a decade ago, when Buehler saw a bedroom preserved for a friend’s daughter who was killed by a drunken driver. </p><p>For this mural, Buehler traveled to Ukraine twice, in October 2023 and September 2024. After his first trip, he created <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/17/irpin-ukraine-car-cemetery-new-york" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 60-foot-long photograph of a “car cemetery,”</a> showing abandoned and destroyed vehicles in Irpin, one of the Kyiv suburbs ravaged early in the invasion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-12"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A painting by an unidentified Ukrainian child, on view in the exhibition “Empty Beds.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Buehler.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A painting by Diana, one of the 388 Ukrainian children who have been returned after being taken from their families by Russian forces.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phil Buehler.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I think every parent can imagine there’s some loved child there,” Buehler said, referring to the bedroom photos. He hopes the mural, spanning an entire block, creates space for viewers to reflect on loss and waiting.</p><p>“I wanted it out on the street, where anyone passing by could stop and engage with the work,” he said.</p><p>To bring the installation to life, Buehler collaborated with <a href="https://www.birdoflightukraine.org/about" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bird of Light Ukraine</a>, a New York-based N.G.O. focused on humanitarian efforts. Bird of Light connected him with key organizations in Ukraine, among them the <a href="https://childrights.org.ua/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian Child Rights Network</a> and President Volodymyr Zelensky’s <a href="https://www.bringkidsback.org.ua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bring Kids Back</a> initiative.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children visiting  the “Empty Beds” installation.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Clark Hodgin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The illegal removal of Ukrainian children has been one of the war’s most painful consequences, with many families torn apart and <a href="https://childrenofwar.gov.ua/en/stories-of-children/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">children deprived of their cultural identity</a>. “The children held by Russia are forbidden to speak Ukrainian, and their identities are being systematically erased,” said Zhanna Galeyeva, a founder of Bird of Light Ukraine.</p><p>Buehler hopes “Empty Beds” will inspire viewers to act — whether by donating or spreading awareness.</p><p>“Art must engage people,” he said. “Sometimes the photographs make them curious.
