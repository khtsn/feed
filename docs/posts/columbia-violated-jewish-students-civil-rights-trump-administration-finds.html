The finding of a civil rights violation often precedes consequences. In Columbia’s case, the administration has already suspended more than $400 million in grants and contracts. It was not immediately clear whether the administration would seek further penalties.</p><p>The Trump administration has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">attempting to change the culture of American higher education</a> by withholding federal funding, contending that some schools have become bastions of antisemitism and ideological indoctrination. A handful of elite universities, including Columbia and Harvard, have been particular targets.</p><p>Though the higher education industry has acknowledged shortcomings and failures, university leaders fear that the government is trying to stamp out academic freedom.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In response to Thursday’s finding, Columbia said that the school would continue to work with the government on combating antisemitism, harassment and discrimination. Unlike Harvard, Columbia has generally sought to cooperate with the Trump administration’s demands.</p><p>“We understand this finding is part of our ongoing discussions with the government,” a spokesman for the university said in a statement.</p><p>On Thursday, the Trump administration said it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html" title="">halt Harvard’s ability to enroll international students</a>, who comprise more than a quarter of the student body. The action would significantly affect Harvard’s finances, as international students tend to pay full tuition as well as room and board. Earlier, the federal government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">froze $2.2 billion</a> in grants and a $60 million contract for Harvard.</p><p>When its federal funding was frozen in March, Columbia said it would make changes to its campus protest and security policies as well as to its Middle Eastern studies department to comply with the Trump administration’s demands. Harvard has refused to comply with demands to change its student discipline policies, curriculum, and hiring and admission practices.</p><p>Students have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/us/college-protests-israel-hamas-war-antisemitism.html" title="">protested at scores of universities</a> across the country since Israel’s war in Gaza began in 2023, and the movement was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/us/columbia-protests-encampment.html" title="">particularly active</a> at Columbia last spring. Hundreds of students were arrested over pro-Palestinian demonstrations on the campus. Some Jewish students reported experiencing discrimination for their ancestry or support for Israel to Columbia’s Task Force on Antisemitism, which Thursday’s finding cited.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At the school’s main commencement ceremony on Wednesday, graduates booed acting President Claire Shipman as she delivered remarks. Ms. Shipman noted the absence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-detention-judge.html" title="">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a prominent student activist who was scheduled to graduate but has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Louisiana since March. At a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the campus, some alumni <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/nyregion/columbia-president-booed-commencement.html" title="">burned their diplomas</a>.</p><p>Jonah E.
