They argue that the state’s law violates federal statutes establishing an Election Day because it allows absentee ballots to be received and counted after the election.</p><p>Republicans have repeatedly challenged state laws that allow ballots sent by mail to be counted after Election Day, an issue that President Trump pressed after his loss in the 2020 election, in which the use of mail balloting expanded because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A federal trial court had dismissed the case, finding that Mr. Bost and the electors lacked standing, meaning that they were not able to show they were directly injured by the state law. A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1365286/dl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal appeals court agreed</a>. Mr. Bost, who is represented by the conservative activist group Judicial Watch, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-568/332166/20241119111610479_241110a%20Petition%20for%20efiling.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked the justices</a> to weigh in.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The election law dispute is one of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060225zor_4f15.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four new cases</a> that the justices agreed on Monday to add to their docket for next term. The others include a case about <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-758.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">whether immigrant detainees can sue</a> a private detention company that they accuse of forcing them to perform labor; <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-624.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Montana case</a> about when law enforcement officers may enter a home without a search warrant if they believe an emergency is underway; and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-924.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a dispute</a> over whether a U.S. soldier injured by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan can sue the government contractor who had employed the bomber.</p><p>The justices had already agreed to hear another high-profile dispute during their upcoming term, which will begin the first Monday in October — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/supreme-court-conversion-therapy.html" title="">First Amendment challenge</a> to a Colorado law that prohibits conversion therapy intended to change a minor’s gender identity or sexual orientation. The justices will likely add more cases in the coming weeks as they wrap up their current term.</p><p>The immigration detainee dispute involves allegations of forced labor against GEO Group, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/us/politics/private-prisons-immigrants-detention-trump.html" title="">largest private prison operator</a> in the United States. A group of immigrants held at a GEO facility in Aurora, Colo., sued the company in 2014, claiming detainees were forced to perform unpaid janitorial work. The immigrants said in court filings that the company sent them to solitary confinement — “the hole” — if they refused.</p><p>Lawyers for the immigrants <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-758/356093/20250421133820724_Menocal.BIO.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed that detainees</a> came back from confinement “skinny,” “afraid” and “antisocial” — unable to “talk to other people.” While the company called the program voluntary, the migrants’ lawyers said only by participating could they earn money to buy basic necessities, including food and toiletries.</p><p>GEO Group has argued that it was shielded from such lawsuits because it operated the facility under a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Under a legal doctrine known as sovereign immunity, the government is immunized against many such lawsuits, and GEO argued that it should be immune, too, because its programs were authorized and directed by the federal government. A lower court disagreed, and GEO Group <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-758/356093/20250421133820724_Menocal.BIO.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked the justices</a> to consider whether such a court order was immediately appealable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The case has taken on new significance as the Trump administration has worked to detain thousands of migrants, including sometimes in facilities run by the GEO Group.</p><p>The justices also agreed to consider a case about whether law enforcement officers can enter a house without a search warrant if an emergency is underway.</p><p>The case involves a Montana man, <a href="https://www.kxlf.com/news/local-news/anaconda-man-shot-by-police-claims-rights-violated" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Trevor Case</a>, who was shot and wounded by police in September 2021. Officers went to Mr. Case’s home for a welfare check after a report that he had been making suicidal threats. The officers waited outside for about 40 minutes, then went inside to look for him. An officer began to open a closet curtain, saw a “dark object” near Mr. Case’s waist and shot him. Police said he was armed with a handgun. Mr. Case was later convicted of assault on a police officer, a felony, based on evidence police seized from the house.</p><p>Mr. Case had argued that police improperly entered his home without enough evidence to support a stringent standard of proof that an emergency was underway.</p><p>But the Montana Supreme Court rejected that argument, finding that requiring such a high standard for officers to enter a residence when they believe an emergency is underway is “unwieldy.” The court held that police needed to have only some “objective, specific and articulable facts from which an experienced officer would suspect that a citizen is in need of help or is in peril” to enter their home without a search warrant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Lawyers for Mr. Case had asked the justices to weigh in, arguing that the case offered the opportunity to clarify a previous ruling. In a 2006 case, Brigham City v. Stuart, the Supreme Court had held that before officers enter a home without a warrant, they must have “an objectively reasonable basis” for believing someone is “seriously injured” or threatened with injury. The Montana case, they said, would allow the justices to clear up confusion among the lower courts on how much proof is required to justify a warrantless home entry when officers believe they need to deliver emergency aid.</p><p>The final case the court accepted Monday involves whether a U.S. soldier can sue a government contractor for negligence. Winston T. Hencely, a former U.S. Army specialist, sued Fluor Corporation after he was injured in a 2016 suicide bombing in Afghanistan.</p><p>Mr. Hencely, who was stationed at Bagram Airfield, was injured in November 2016 by a suicide bomber who struck during a Veterans Day 5K race, according to court filings by his lawyers.</p><p>As hundreds of troops gathered for the race, a suicide bomber, Ahmad Nayeb, walked toward the soldiers but was confronted by Mr. Hencely and others. The bomber then detonated an explosive vest, killing five people and wounding more than a dozen more. Mr. Hencely’s lawyers said he saved hundreds of fellow soldiers.</p><p>Mr. Nayeb had been employed by a subcontractor of Fluor Corporation, and an Army investigation found that failures by the government contractor to supervise employees were “the primary contributing factor” to the bombing.</p><p>Mr. Hencely sued the company for negligence under South Carolina law, but a federal appeals court held that his claims were barred by “federal interests” under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which immunizes the government from such lawsuits. Mr. Hencely then sought a review by the Supreme Court.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times.
