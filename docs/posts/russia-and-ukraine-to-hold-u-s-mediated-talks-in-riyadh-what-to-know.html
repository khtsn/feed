It will be followed by Russia on Monday. <a href="https://x.com/rustem_umerov/status/1903833939698930144" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rustem Umerov</a>, the Ukrainian defense minister leading his country’s delegation, said the talks on Sunday had begun around 5:30 p.m. Kyiv time and ended some five hours later. “The discussion was productive and focused — we addressed key points including energy,” he <a href="https://x.com/rustem_umerov/status/1903908261016870980" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a>, without offering details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>A Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said the Ukrainian delegation might hold additional discussions with U.S. officials on Monday, depending on progress.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, in Kyiv, the capital, last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Steve Witkoff, whom President Trump has tapped to be his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/witkoff-trumps-russia-putin.html" title="">personal envoy to President Vladimir V. Putin</a> of Russia, has said that the ultimate goal of the talks is a 30-day full cease-fire that would allow time for negotiations on a permanent truce.</p><p>But the path toward such a truce has been shaky. Moscow continues to insist on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/trump-putin-call-russia-ukraine-war.html" title="">maximalist positions</a>, including about asserting territorial control and ensuring Ukraine never joins NATO. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly said that it will not concede to the Kremlin’s demands and accused Mr. Putin of stalling for time.</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-ukraine-talks-rubio-saudi-arabia.html" title="">previous cease-fire discussions</a>, which involved top government officials from all sides, this new round will focus on technical matters and will mostly involve diplomats and government advisers. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, said that the American delegation included some of his own staff, along with Michael Anton, policy planning director at the State Department; and aides to the national security adviser, Michael Waltz.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-291b262">The Russian delegation</h2><p>Dmitri S.

He added that a third party would have to monitor the cease-fire and suggested that the United States could do so.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>While Russia and Ukraine may find common ground in talks about energy and shipping, both have laid out conditions for a complete cessation of hostilities that appear irreconcilable — a sign of the steep challenges ahead in any broader peace negotiations.</p><h2 id="link-da926ab">Moscow’s position</h2><p>This past week, during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/europe/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">telephone conversation with Mr. Trump</a>, Mr. Putin said that Russia would agree to a temporary truce only if Ukraine stopped mobilizing soldiers, training troops or importing weapons for the duration of any pause in fighting.</p><p>Mr. Putin also demanded the complete halt of foreign military aid and intelligence to Kyiv, calling it “the key condition for preventing an escalation of the conflict and making progress toward its resolution through political and diplomatic means,” <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76477" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Kremlin’s readout</a> of the call.</p><p>The White House said that military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElUUgflrQjE&amp;t=1122s&amp;ab_channel=TheWhiteHouse" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would continue</a> despite the Kremlin’s demands. But the Trump administration has been less clear on Moscow’s calls for territorial concessions and at times even appeared to align with the Kremlin’s stance.</p><p>Mr. Witkoff <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&amp;ab_channel=TuckerCarlson" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">echoed a Kremlin talking point</a> on Sunday when he tried to legitimize <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-referendums-annexation.html" title="">the staged referendums</a> that the Russian occupation forces held in parts of Ukraine to justify the annexation of those territories taken by military force. “There is a view within the country of Russia that these are Russian territories,” Mr. Witkoff told Fox News. “There are referendums within these territories that justify these actions.” Those referendums were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/world/europe/us-decries-russian-move-to-annex-parts-of-ukraine-as-a-land-grab.html" title="">widely denounced as fraudulent and illegal</a> by the international community.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Fundamentally, Russia’s position regarding the conflict has remained the same. The Kremlin says it wants to “eliminate the root causes of the crisis” — essentially demanding that Ukraine capitulate. That would mean Kyiv’s recognizing Russia’s territorial gains, declaring neutrality and agreeing to shrink its military, which would most likely leave Ukraine vulnerable to another invasion.</p><h2 id="link-15ef15f6">Kyiv’s position</h2><p>Ukraine had previously agreed to an unconditional 30-day truce to cease all combat operations, at the urging of the Trump administration. But after Moscow said that it would support only a partial cease-fire on energy infrastructure, Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html?searchResultPosition=3" title="">spoke with Mr. Trump</a> and agreed to the limited truce.</p><p>In recent days, Ukrainian officials have set out red lines going into negotiations: Kyiv will never accept Russian sovereignty over occupied Ukrainian territory, it will not agree to be blocked from joining NATO or to reduce the size of its army, and it must have security guarantees as part of any peace settlement.</p><p>Many Ukrainian officials and analysts express doubt that even a limited cease-fire will hold for long, noting that previous truces between Moscow and Kyiv were routinely violated, with each side blaming the other.</p><p>“I do not believe in a cease-fire. We’ve been through this before,” Kostyantyn Yeliseev, a seasoned diplomat and former Ukrainian deputy foreign minister who took part in cease-fire negotiations in 2014 and 2015, said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-b30f02b">What’s next?</h2><p>Mr. Witkoff said on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-03-19/trump-likely-to-meet-russia-s-putin-says-witkoff-video" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview with Bloomberg News</a> that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin were “likely” to meet in Saudi Arabia within weeks. American officials will also probably continue meeting their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in the Middle East to discuss details of a possible limited truce.</p><p>But the foundations of the diplomatic process have been wobbly, analysts said, with Moscow and Kyiv ready to continue fighting.</p><p>“Both sides still believe that they can continue the war regardless of the American position,” said Dmitry Kuznets, a military analyst with the Russian news outlet Meduza, which operates from Latvia after being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/world/europe/russia-media-meduza.html" title="">outlawed by the Kremlin</a>.</p><p>He added, “Moscow’s and Kyiv’s visions of what an agreement could look like are still infinitely far from each other.”</p><p>Maria Varenikova<!-- --> and <!-- -->Minho Kim<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
