It was 2019 and the 135-square-foot queen-bed room in Midtown Manhattan felt like it could be a good home, or at least a better one.</p><p>It was nothing like where Paul, then 13, had most recently been living with his mother in California: There were no mice running around, no one was fighting outside his window and no strangers were stopping by at odd hours.

But now, in the cramped hotel room, he felt trapped.</p><p>Before Paul moved in, his father had already started a legal war with the hotel’s owners. First, Mr. Barreto took them to housing court and argued that an obscure New York City rent law could make Room 2565 his permanent residence. He won.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
