According to two federal officials with knowledge of the matter, the materials were classified documents that had been in Mr. Donlon’s possession for years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Nor did he say how many homes had been searched or where they were.

Here is a closer look at how people with ties to Adams are related to the inquiries.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He resigned on Sept. 12, saying the investigation had become a distraction. The administration had sought his resignation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>Mr. Donlon, a Bronx native, has a long background in federal law enforcement, including with the F.B.I. He has served in counterterrorism jobs domestically and abroad and in security for Wall Street firms. Most recently, he ran a private security and consulting company, Global Security Resolutions, that he founded in 2020.</p><p>It is unclear what job Mr. Donlon may have held when the material the agents sought came into his possession.</p><p>From 2002 to 2003, he was in charge of the F.B.I.’s New York Counterterrorism Center, and he worked for the agency’s National Threat Center until 2005, according to a news release from a New York State Senate committee that later vetted his nomination <a href="https://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/riverdale-resident-appointed,40114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to lead the state’s Office of Homeland Security</a>. Mr. Adams, a state senator at the time, led the committee. In 2005, Mr. Donlon joined Credit Suisse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When Mr. Adams announced Mr. Donlon’s appointment as interim commissioner this month, he called him “an experienced law enforcement professional who has worked at the local, state, federal and international levels.”</p><p>Mr. Donlon, for his part, promised to “uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency.”</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- -->, <!-- -->Alyce McFadden<!-- --> and <!-- -->William K.
