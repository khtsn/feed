Donlon</a>, whom Mayor Eric Adams had chosen to lead the Police Department only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">nine days earlier</a>, said the search warrants executed by the agents were unrelated to the department, which has been caught up in a series of federal criminal investigations that are swirling around the mayor’s administration.</p><p>“They took materials that came into my possession approximately 20 years ago and are unrelated to my work with the New York City Police Department,” Mr. Donlon said in a news release issued by the department shortly after 11 p.m. “This is not a department matter, and the department will not be commenting.”</p><p>Mr. Donlon did not offer details about the materials that were seized. According to two federal officials with knowledge of the matter, the materials were classified documents that had been in Mr. Donlon’s possession for years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>He also did not say how many homes had been searched or where they were. Mr. Donlon’s voter registration lists his current address as an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p><p>It was not clear which agency conducted the searches; the F.B.I.’s New York office said early Sunday that it would not comment on the matter.</p><p>A spokesman for the mayor, Fabien Levy, declined to comment on Sunday about the searches or on whether they would have an effect on Mr. Donlon’s position. Mr. Adams did not address the investigations on Sunday during his radio show, “Hear From the Mayor” on WBLS.</p><p>Mr. Donlon’s predecessor, Edward A. Caban, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">resigned</a> after federal agents seized his telephone on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html" title="">Sept. 4</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Police Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/nyregion/nypd-commissioner-caban-adams.html" title="">is under scrutiny</a> in one of at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">four federal inquiries</a> buffeting Mr. Adams’s administration. The searches of Mr. Donlon’s residences were not related to any of those investigations, the federal officials with knowledge of the matter said. But the investigations have involved searches and seizures targeting high-ranking officials, including Mr. Caban. The specter of the police-related investigation cast doubt on Mr. Caban’s ability to supervise a department of more than 30,000 officers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He resigned on Sept. 12, saying the investigation had become a distraction. The administration had sought his resignation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>Mr. Donlon, a Bronx native, has a long background in federal law enforcement, including with the F.B.I. He has served in counterterrorism jobs domestically and abroad and in security for Wall Street firms. Most recently, he ran a private security and consulting company, Global Security Resolutions, that he founded in 2020.</p><p>It is unclear what job Mr. Donlon may have held when the material that the agents sought came into his possession.</p><p>From 2002 to 2003, he was in charge of the F.B.I.’s New York Counterterrorism Center, and he worked for the agency’s National Threat Center until 2005, according to a news release from a New York State Senate committee that later vetted his nomination <a href="https://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/riverdale-resident-appointed,40114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to lead the state’s Office of Homeland Security</a>. Mr. Adams, a state senator at the time, led the committee. In 2005, Mr. Donlon joined Credit Suisse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>When Mr. Adams announced Mr. Donlon’s appointment as interim commissioner this month, he called him “an experienced law enforcement professional who has worked at the local, state, federal and international levels.”</p><p>Mr. Donlon, for his part, promised to “uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency.”</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- -->, <!-- -->Alyce McFadden<!-- --> and <!-- -->William K.
