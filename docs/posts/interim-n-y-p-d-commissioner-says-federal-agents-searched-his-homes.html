Donlon</a>, whom Mayor Eric Adams chose to lead the Police Department only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">nine days ago</a>, said the search warrants executed by the agents were unrelated to the department, which has been caught up in a series of federal criminal investigations that are swirling around the mayor’s administration.</p><p>“They took materials that came into my possession approximately 20 years ago and are unrelated to my work with the New York City Police Department,” Mr. Donlon said in a news release issued by the department shortly after 11 p.m. “This is not a department matter, and the department will not be commenting.”</p><p>Mr. Donlon did not offer details about the materials that were seized, nor did he say how many homes had been searched or where they were. Nor was it clear which agency conducted the searches; the F.B.I.’s New York office said early Sunday that it would not comment on the matter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Donlon’s predecessor, Edward A.

The investigations have involved searches and seizures targeting high-ranking officials, including Mr. Caban. The specter of the police-related investigation cast doubt on Mr. Caban’s ability to supervise a department of more than 30,000 officers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/multimedia/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index/2024-09-09-eric-adams-orbit-investigations-index-articleLarge-v2.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Tracking Investigations in Eric Adams’s Orbit</h2><p>Several federal corruption inquiries have reached into the world of Mayor Eric Adams of New York, who faces re-election next year.

The administration had sought his resignation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>Mr. Donlon, a Bronx native, has a long background in federal law enforcement, including with the F.B.I. He has served in counterterrorism jobs domestically and abroad and in security for Wall Street firms. Most recently, he ran a private security and consulting company, Global Security Resolutions, that he founded in 2020.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It is unclear what job Mr. Donlon may have held when the material the agents sought came into his possession.</p><p>From 2002 to 2003, he was in charge of the F.B.I.’s New York Counterterrorism Center, and he worked for the agency’s National Threat Center until 2005, according to a news release from a New York State Senate committee that later vetted his nomination <a href="https://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/riverdale-resident-appointed,40114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to lead the state’s Office of Homeland Security</a>. Mr. Adams, a state senator at the time, led the committee. In 2005, Mr. Donlon joined Credit Suisse.</p><p>When Mr. Adams announced Mr. Donlon’s appointment as interim commissioner this month, he called him “an experienced law enforcement professional who has worked at the local, state, federal and international levels.”</p><p>Mr. Donlon, for his part, promised to “uphold the highest standards of integrity and transparency.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/new-york-city-police-department">New York City Police Department [NYPD]</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Mayor in Turmoil:</strong> As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html">federal investigations</a> swirl around Mayor Eric Adams, his political influence, his agenda and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/nyregion/eric-adams-scandal-crisis.html">his re-election effort are at risk</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Insurance Crisis Looms:</strong> The largest insurer of taxis and Ubers in New York City is insolvent.
