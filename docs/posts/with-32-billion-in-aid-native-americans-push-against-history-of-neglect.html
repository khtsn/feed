people tucked near the San Juan Mountains, has the trappings of a humble but healthy small-town economy: bustling businesses, congenial single-family homes, a park with grassy fields, a public pool, playgrounds, a pond and skate ramps.</p><p>A couple of hours southwest is Tuba City, Ariz., the largest community on Navajo Nation tribal lands. It has roughly the same population as Cortez, and it is surrounded by the same sandstone and mesa-filled <a href="https://navajonationparks.org/navajo-tribal-parks/monument-valley/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">terrain</a>. But despite the area’s rich history of trade, and its proximity to thriving cities like Flagstaff and tourist sites like the Grand Canyon, widespread poverty and a lack of public services are notably entrenched — the stark reality across many reservations throughout the country.</p><p>Gas stations, dollar stores and fast-food chains fill most of the skinny commercial strips. R.V. trailers and other mobile homes make up much of the housing stock. One in three Navajo households has income below the federal poverty line.

There are the barriers to homeownership; the tension of seeing friends and family members, like her older brother, leave to chase <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/letters/archive/2018/12/reader-response-brain-drain-indian-reservations/577774/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opportunities elsewhere</a>; and even resistance to change within tribal ranks.</p><p>Among younger generations, Ms. Lee argues, there are complaints that distrust of capitalists among tribal elders — who tend to have a large say in greenlighting or halting private projects — can shoo away entrepreneurs and employment opportunities.</p><p>That aside, people on reservations generally cannot secure a conventional home mortgage. That caps what is typically a key source of household and generational wealth for most Americans. And because homeownership can be a critical source of collateral for small-business loans, access to capital is also heavily curbed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“We tried to get a loan for the media company,” Ms. Lee said. They were turned down. “We had no collateral. The only thing we really own is our equipment.”</p><p>With Ms. Fleming’s help, they got the business off the ground with “kinship loans,” as Change Labs calls the lending it provides. They are loans of up to $10,000, with no collateral needed at a 5 percent interest rate, which Ms. Fleming says is meant to “create the financial infrastructure you need to secure future loans, investments or grants,” largely based on character assessments and the viability of proposed plans.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The economic development efforts aim to help future generations avoid having to leave tribal lands to find opportunity.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sharon Chischilly for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“We always get the question of why not move to California, or Austin or even New Mexico, where they have an emerging film scene,” Ms. Lee said.</p><p>Aging elders on both sides of their family are part of the reason. “We want to be able to be close enough to spend time with them regularly,” she said, especially as parents of a 7-year-old daughter and a newborn son.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>But paradoxically, they also feel a pioneering spirit in staying put.</p><p>“It’s easy to move away from Cameron — or any other reservation community — to a large city, get a job with consistent pay, have access to child care, grocery stores that are around the corner, even housing that is ready to move in,” she said.</p><p>“But it feels like if we don’t do it, no one’s going to do it, you know?” she added. “Like, if we don’t try and help create an economic basis or grounding, then no one’s going to do it, because no one has done it yet.”</p><p>It can sound tautological: Few people are staying because few people are staying. But economic theory, and practice, indicate a core truth to such feedback loops for local economies. Whatever their size, they depend on a virtuous cycle of agglomeration: the growing concentration of people, industry, infrastructure and culture that turns places into self-sustaining ecosystems.</p><p>Reversing <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/11/blackfeet-brain-drain/568156/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the drain</a> of capital, if it were to happen, would take decades — and require private enterprise, not just government spending.</p><p>Chief Lynn Malerba, the first Native American treasurer of the United States, who leads the newly established Office of Tribal and Native Affairs within the Treasury Department, said she viewed the American Rescue Plan funds for native communities as “a down payment” for recompense of centuries of loss.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The federal government technically owns the lands on which tribal nations reside, holding them “in trust.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sharon Chischilly for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Structural improvements, however, tend to take time. According to the U.S. Treasury, more than 95 percent of the American Rescue Plan funds dedicated to tribal governments have been “obligated” for a specific purpose (meaning legally committed or contracted to be spent). But much of the money — dripping through the pipelines of local political bottlenecks, contract bidding and so on — has not yet been spent. Tribes have until the end of 2026 to use the funds.</p><p>“I feel like I’ve seen no impact so far,” said Laris Manuelito, a military veteran and aspiring entrepreneur working with Change Labs who also attended the mocktail party.</p><p>Living in a food desert on the other end of the reservation in northwest New Mexico, Ms. Manuelito, 49, dreams of opening a solar-powered Whole Foods-style supermarket and cafe that has a shaded flea market in the front lot. “A third place,” she said, in a region that lacks many.</p><p>She was happy to hear that Indian Country was included in the State Small Business Credit Initiative as part of the American Rescue Plan.
