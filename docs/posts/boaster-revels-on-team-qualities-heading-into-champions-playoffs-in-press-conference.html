<p><strong>You&#39;ve made it to the top eight and will face either Heretics, Trace, or G2 in the next round. Is there a specific team you&#39;d prefer to play against?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boaster: &#34;If I had to choose, I&#39;d pick G2. The reason is that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever played against them in the entire existence of Valorant. It would be a fun match, and I&#39;ve seen them at events ever since Iceland, but I&#39;ve never played them yet. So, that&#39;s the match I&#39;d like to have.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You performed very well and seemed to be the standout player. What do you think went right for you to continue to play well, despite the shaky first map?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Derke: &#34;Sunset has never been a good map for me, and it was a bit shaky initially. But I was like just like trying to communicate and help out others. I felt like we could have won despite us being down so much, but I also knew that I couldn&#39;t get tilted if I&#39;m having a bad game. After we lost Sunset, I knew we had Haven and Lotus coming up, which are my two best maps, so I was confident in those.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Despite a shaky start, everyone on the team had standout moments, like hiro&#39;s clutch and Chronicle&#39;s play with the Operator. How important is that for the form of the team moving forward into the future as FNATIC heads into playoffs, both physically and mentally?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boaster: &#34;Each player on our team knows how to win. Whether it be LOCK//IN or Tokyo, or EMEA for hiro, we know how to win. We know what we&#39;re capable of when we&#39;re feeling ourselves. Honestly, with our team since everyone is so good, we don&#39;t need one person to pop off consistently; we can take turns stepping up. That&#39;s the trust you need in your teammates. If we can stay positive and we can keep up a good mood and good comms, then that allows for someone else to thrive who may not thrive if we were to all go negative and start being quiet.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Before the event, Boaster mentioned the team had zero expectations. Now that you&#39;re heading into the playoffs, have your expectations changed at all, or are they still at the bare minimum?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boaster: &#34;For me, I don&#39;t like expectations, so I&#39;m not expecting anything. I&#39;m just going with the flow and going in the vibes. I wouldn&#39;t be here if I didn&#39;t think we could win this event and do well. I believe in the players I have in front of me and what they&#39;re capable of and how sick at the game they are. There&#39;s so much potential in this team and these individuals. No expectations, but I believe to achieve.&#34;</p>
