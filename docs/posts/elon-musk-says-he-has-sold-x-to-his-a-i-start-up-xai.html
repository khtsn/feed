X’s price was down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html" title="">from the $44 billion</a> that Mr. Musk paid for the social media company in 2022, but higher than the $12 billion valuation that some of X’s investors have recently assigned it. The last valuation of xAI, at a December fund-raising round, was about $40 billion.</p><p>Both companies are privately held and already share significant resources, such as engineers. A chatbot called Grok, made by xAI, is trained on data posted by X users and is available on X. Last month, bankers for X told investors that some of the social media company’s revenue came from xAI.</p><p>Mr. Musk wrote in his post that “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined.”</p><p>“Today,” he said, “we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.” He added, “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The deal shows how Mr. Musk can play with different parts of his business empire. In this case, he folded a company that had been losing value, X, into one that had been gaining value, xAI. Mr. Musk previously made a similar maneuver in 2016, when he used stock of his electric car company Tesla to buy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/business/dealbook/tesla-solarcity-elon-musk.html" title="">SolarCity</a>, a clean energy company where he was the largest shareholder and his cousin, Lyndon Rive, was chief executive.</p><p>While Tesla is a publicly traded company that must disclose its finances and other information to shareholders, most of Mr. Musk’s companies are privately held and are more opaque.<span>  </span>Those include the rocket manufacturer SpaceX, the tunneling start-up The Boring Company and the brain interface company Neuralink. Mr. Musk often moves resources and employees between his companies, defying traditional business norms and operating his various companies as one big Musk enterprise.</p><p>Linda Yaccarino, X’s chief executive, wrote on X of the deal: “The future could not be brighter.” X declined to comment. </p><p>X and xAI have been on different trajectories. X is much more widely known, and Mr. Musk has used it as a battering ram to advance his political views, campaigning on the platform for President Trump and whipping support for his governmental cost-cutting effort, known as the Department of Government Efficiency. </p><p>But X’s financial outlook has declined since Mr. Musk bought the company. Most of the social media site’s revenue comes from advertising, but brands have been wary to spend on X as Mr. Musk has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/business/dealbook/elon-musk-advertisers-blackmail-iger.html" title="">courted controversy</a> and thrown out the company’s content moderation rules in favor of a more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/elon-musk-x-posts.html" title="">anything-goes atmosphere</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>X’s valuation plummeted to $12 billion in December, according to Fidelity, one of the investors that participated in Mr. Musk’s acquisition.</p><p>While some advertisers have recently returned to X, hoping to curry favor as Mr. Musk became a close adviser to Mr. Trump, the company has yet to regain financial stability. In January, Mr. Musk told employees that revenue was “unimpressive” and the company was “barely breaking even.”</p><p>This month, X continued to struggle to hit its revenue targets, according to an internal email seen by The New York Times. As of March 3,<span>  </span>X had served $91 million of ads this year,<span>  </span>the message said, well below its first-quarter target of $153 million.</p><p>“The time to sprint to the finish line is now,” the email said, urging sales people to pick up the pace.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In contrast, xAI has grown rapidly. The A.I. start-up raised $6 billion from investors in December, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/technology/elon-musk-xai-valuation.html" title="">valuing it at $35 billion to $40 billion</a>, up from $24 billion in May 2024.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The xAI supercomputer site in Memphis.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The company has also put down roots in Memphis, where Mr. Musk has built what he says will be the world’s largest supercomputer. </p><p>Mr. Musk started xAI in 2023 to compete with OpenAI, the A.I. lab that he co-founded and that makes ChatGPT. Mr. Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and has since sued the company and offered to acquire it, arguing that only he can responsibly create A.I. that would not destroy humanity.</p><p>(The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, in December 2023 for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI and Microsoft have denied the claims.)</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/technology/elon-musk-x-debt-sale.html" title="">X’s bankers sold off much of the company’s debt</a>, a task that they had viewed as nearly impossible before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Investors who bought the debt were told that X’s revenue had improved, in part because xAI was paying X to license its data, essentially funneling funds from one of Mr. Musk’s companies to the other.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The news of Friday’s deal was celebrated inside X. </p><p>“This is an extremely exciting step for all of us,” Ms. Yaccarino wrote in an email to employees that was seen by The Times. </p><p>Ryan Mac<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kate Conger is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.
