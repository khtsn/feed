The meeting between senior officials from both countries was a striking display of bonhomie after three years of American efforts to isolate Moscow for its 2022 invasion.</p><p>After more than four hours of talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both sides had agreed to work on a peace settlement for Ukraine as well as to explore “the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians,” both geopolitically and economically.</p><p>“We weren’t just listening to each other, but we heard each other,” Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said. “I have reason to believe that the American side started to better understand our positions.”</p><p>The meeting, the most extensive negotiations in more than three years between the two global powers, was the latest swerve by the Trump administration in abandoning Western efforts to punish Russia for starting Europe’s most destructive war in generations. It signaled Mr. Trump’s intention to roll back the Biden administration’s approach toward Moscow, which focused on sanctions, isolation and sending weapons to Ukraine that helped kill tens of thousands of Russian soldiers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Speaking to reporters after the meeting, American officials did not dwell on Russia’s violation of international law in attacking Ukraine, its alleged war crimes or the three years of devastation that Russian shelling and bombardment had wrought in parts of Ukraine. Instead, they repeatedly lauded Mr. Trump for trying to stop the fighting by talking to Russia in a way that his predecessor did not.</p><p>“For three years,” Mr. Rubio said, “no one else has been able to bring something together like what we saw today, because Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that can.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/18us-russia-talks-01-mpkh/18us-russia-talks-01-mpkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/18us-russia-talks-01-mpkh/18us-russia-talks-01-mpkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/multimedia/18us-russia-talks-01-mpkh/18us-russia-talks-01-mpkh-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The American secretary of state, in a blue suit, walks through a door in a large room.

Mr. Witkoff called the meeting “positive, upbeat, constructive.”</p><p>The Russian delegation included Yuri Ushakov, Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adviser, and Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. Speaking to Russian television, Mr. Dmitriev described a jovial atmosphere — “there were a lot of jokes” and a “very tasty” lunch — while Mr. Ushakov said that both sides also discussed preparations for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. He offered no details on when a summit might take place.</p><p>Russia appeared to be using Tuesday’s talks to cater to Mr. Trump’s interest in profits and natural resources, arguing that American oil companies and others stood to gain hundreds of billions of dollars by again doing business in Russia.</p><p>Mr. Dmitriev, who worked with Mr. Witkoff to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/marc-fogel-teacher-released-russia.html" title="">broker the release last week of an American schoolteacher</a> jailed in Russia, said he would seek to restart economic cooperation with the United States to “rebuild communication, rebuild trust, rebuild success.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“U.S. oil majors have had very successful business in Russia,” Mr. Dmitriev said in a brief interview on Tuesday before the talks began, offering an example of how the countries could rebuild business ties. “We believe at some point they will be coming back, because why would they forgo these opportunities that Russia gave them to have access to Russian natural resources?”</p><p>Russian commentators have expressed the hope that talks with the Trump administration and a peace deal in Ukraine could pave the way for the United States to lift the severe sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Moscow.</p><p>Leading Western oil companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/business/russia-exxon.html" title="">including Exxon Mobil</a>, joined many other businesses in pulling out of Russia three years ago amid outrage over Mr. Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

He described them as “the extraordinary opportunities that exist should this conflict come to an acceptable end.”</p><p>Tuesday’s discussions were the first time after Mr. Putin’s invasion in early 2022 that broad delegations of senior American and Russian officials are known to have met in person.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In Europe and Ukraine, the news of Tuesday’s talks had been met with confusion and concern. While Mr. Rubio characterized the talks as preliminary, there was widespread criticism in Europe that Mr. Trump’s approach to Russia had not been coordinated with allies of the United States. </p><p>But for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed, hosting the talks has offered a major opportunity to solidify his status as a global leader with influence that extends beyond the Middle East.</p><p>The Saudis, in a Foreign Ministry statement, said they were welcoming the Russians and Americans “as part of the kingdom’s efforts to enhance security and peace in the world.”</p><p>Like other countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has avoided taking sides in the Ukraine war.</p><p>It has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine while cultivating close ties with Russia. When a Ukraine peace conference was held in Switzerland last June that excluded Russia, Saudi Arabia and the neighboring United Arab Emirates refused to sign the final joint statement.</p><p>Andrew E.
