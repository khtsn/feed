Ukraine and Europe were watching from a distance with deep apprehension, amid fears that Mr. Trump could try to force a peace deal on Ukraine that would be favorable to Russia.</p><p>The meeting comes less than a week after Mr. Trump’s lengthy phone call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump said afterward that the two leaders spoke of “the great benefit” that the United States and Russia “will someday have in working together,” and that the two leaders had agreed to “start negotiations immediately” to end the war in Ukraine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The U.S. delegation in Riyadh is led by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state; Michael Waltz, the national security adviser; and Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy and a longtime friend of the president. They were expected to meet Tuesday with Russian officials including Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister; Yuri Ushakov, Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adviser; and Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, said he would seek to restart economic cooperation with the United States in order to “rebuild communication, rebuild trust, rebuild success.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Ushakov told reporters after landing in Riyadh that the goal of the talks would be “to start a real normalization of the relationship between us and Washington.”</p><p>Mr. Dmitriev, who worked with Mr. Witkoff to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/marc-fogel-teacher-released-russia.html" title="">broker the release last week of an American schoolteacher</a> jailed in Russia, said he would seek to restart economic cooperation with the United States in order to “rebuild communication, rebuild trust, rebuild success.”</p><p>“U.S. oil majors have had very successful business in Russia,” Mr. Dmitriev said in a brief interview on Tuesday before the talks began, offering an example of how the countries could rebuild business ties. “We believe at some point they will be coming back, because why would they forego these opportunities that Russia gave them to have access to Russian natural resources?”</p><p>Leading Western oil companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/business/russia-exxon.html" title="">including Exxon Mobil</a>, left Russia after Mr. Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago. Energy and economic ties were among the topics of the call between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump last week, according to Mr. Trump and the Kremlin.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Tuesday’s discussions will be the first time since early 2022 that broad delegations of senior American and Russian officials are known to have met in person. The meeting is another step in Mr. Trump’s bid to end the diplomatic isolation of Russia that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sought to enforce since the start of the invasion — a step that the Trump administration says is necessary in order to stop the war.</p><p>“If there is going to be the possibility of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians,” Mr. Rubio said on the CBS show “Face the Nation” on Sunday.</p><p>But in Europe and Ukraine, the news of Tuesday’s planned talks has been met with confusion and concern. While Mr. Rubio characterized the talks as preliminary, there was widespread criticism in Europe that Mr. Trump’s approach to Russia hadn’t been coordinated with allies of the United States. And Ukrainian officials insisted they would reject any agreement about their country that was negotiated without their involvement.</p><p>“We cannot recognize any agreements made about us without us,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said Monday. </p><p>Mr. Zelensky is also in the Gulf region this week, where several countries have sought to use their relationships with Moscow, Kyiv and the West to play roles as mediators in the Ukraine war. On Monday, Mr. Zelensky was in the United Arab Emirates to discuss prisoner exchanges and the return of Ukrainian children from Russia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Yesterday, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan during a visit of the United Arab Emirates at al-Shati Palace.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ukraine Presidency, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Via Getty</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ukrainian officials have also said that Mr. Zelensky will be in Saudi Arabia this week, but that Ukraine was not invited to the U.S.-Russia talks.
