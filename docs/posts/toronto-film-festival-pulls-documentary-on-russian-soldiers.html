    <h1>Toronto Film Festival Pulls Documentary on Russian Soldiers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ukrainian diplomats and the Ukrainian community in Canada condemned the film when it was selected for screening at the festival in Canada, which is home to the world’s third-largest population of people of Ukrainian descent. Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s deputy prime minister, said she shared their “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldoqnul6xqg&amp;t=606s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">really grave concerns</a>.” Ms. Freeland’s maternal grandparents were from Ukraine.</p><p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, setting off a series of moves by governments to impose sanctions and punish Russia, and casting a long shadow on the worlds of the arts and sport. The Olympics have prevented Russian athletes from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5662339/2024/07/27/ain-russia-belarus-paris-olympics-2024/" title="">competing under their country’s flag</a>. And Russian artists and performers have faced boycott calls around the world, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/movies/film-boycott-russia-ukraine.html" title="">even when they have condemned their government</a>.</p><p>Some of the film’s critics have said that Ms. Trofimova would never have been able to work in the war zone without <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oleh.nikolenko.ua/posts/pfbid02C1DCAHAmPagmyPhyg9oi8XYjtsvKPM1L7m64QB3vg3UGZLYVAD6hoY8iqkhDEqr9l" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approval from the Russian government</a>. And they have said that her prior work for RT, a global Russian network that is banned in Canada and Europe, demonstrates her bias in favor of Russia. The United States has called RT an important part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/business/russian-bots-artificial-intelligence-propaganda.html" title="">Kremlin’s disinformation</a> and propaganda apparatus.</p><p>Opposition to the film grew louder when it premiered at this year’s Venice Film Festival. Ms. Trofimova <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mqBRQa7_X8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told journalists in Venice</a> last week that it was important to “humanize everyone” and hear from ordinary soldiers and not just political leaders.</p><p>“Russians at War” <a href="https://cmf-fmc.ca/funded-projects/?_project_search=russians%20at%20war" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">received around $250,000</a> in funding through the Canadian Media Fund, a nonprofit that receives contributions from government agencies and cable companies. TVO, a public broadcaster in the province of Ontario that had previously supported the film, <a href="https://tvo.me/statement-by-tvos-board-of-directors-regarding-russians-at-war/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said it would not air</a> it.</p></div></div>
