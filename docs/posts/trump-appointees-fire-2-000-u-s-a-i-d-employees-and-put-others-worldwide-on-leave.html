Development sent employees an email on Sunday afternoon saying that they were firing 2,000 workers and putting up to thousands of foreign service officers and other direct hires around the world on paid leave starting that night.</p><p>The only exceptions to the leave would be people working on “mission-critical programs,” as well as “core leadership” and employees supporting “specially designated programs,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>The email said appointees running U.S.A.I.D. were firing 2,000 employees based in the United States using a mechanism called “reduction in force.” The mass firings are part of a series of layoffs of agency employees by the Trump administration during a broad effort to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-rubio-foreign-aid.html" title="">halt almost all U.S. foreign aid</a> using a blanket freeze.</p><p>The moves came after a judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration could proceed with plans to lay off or put on paid leave many agency employees and close down operations overseas, which means forcing employees based abroad to come back to the United States. Some of those employees say they expect to be fired once they return home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The judge, Carl J. Nichols of the Federal District Court in Washington, had been reviewing a lawsuit<span>  </span>that aimed to block Trump administration officials from enacting the layoffs at the aid agency, putting people on paid leave and compelling overseas employees to quickly return home.</p><p>Since late January, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/foreign-aid-marocco-trump.html" title="">Pete Marocco</a>, a State Department political appointee who was a divisive figure in the first Trump administration, has overseen the dismantling of the aid agency, working alongside Elon Musk, the tech billionaire adviser to President Trump who has posted dark conspiracy theories about U.S.A.I.D.</p><p>Early this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he was the new acting administrator of the agency and was appointing Mr. Marocco as his deputy.</p><p>The email on Sunday said employees taking the “voluntary” route to returning from overseas soon would have their travel paid for by the agency.</p><p>Last week, the appointees running the agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/usaid-urgent-aid-firings.html" title="">fired about 400 employees</a> who work as contractors on urgent humanitarian assistance. That action added to an understanding among many employees that Mr. Rubio does not actually support such programs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Late last month, Mr. Rubio promised that “lifesaving humanitarian assistance” programs could continue. But almost no programs have been able to operate because the agency’s payment system does not function, meaning partner groups cannot get funds.</p><p>Mr. Rubio has said some foreign aid will continue after a 90-day review process, but neither he nor Mr. Marocco, who oversees foreign aid at the State Department, have publicly explained the process, if there is one.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edward Wong reports on global affairs, U.S. foreign policy and the State Department.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/edward-wong">More about Edward Wong</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/agency-for-international-development">Agency for International Development</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/state-department">State Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Cuts to 9/11 Aid</strong><strong>: </strong>The group led by Elon Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/nyregion/doge-ground-zero-health-care-cuts.html">made cuts to a federal program that administers aid to 9/11 responders</a>, drawing bipartisan pushback.
