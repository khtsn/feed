    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The judge, Carl J. Nichols of the Federal District Court in Washington, had been reviewing a lawsuit<span>  </span>that aimed to block Trump administration officials from enacting the layoffs at the aid agency, putting people on paid leave and compelling overseas employees to quickly return home.</p><p>Since late January, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/foreign-aid-marocco-trump.html" title="">Pete Marocco</a>, a State Department political appointee who was a divisive figure in the first Trump administration, has overseen the dismantling of the aid agency, working alongside Elon Musk, the tech billionaire adviser to President Trump who has posted dark conspiracy theories about U.S.A.I.D.</p><p>Early this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he was the new acting administrator of the agency and was appointing Mr. Marocco as his deputy.</p><p>The email on Sunday said employees taking the “voluntary” route to returning from overseas soon would have their travel paid for by the agency.</p><p>Last week, the appointees running the agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/usaid-urgent-aid-firings.html" title="">fired about 400 employees</a> who work as contractors on urgent humanitarian assistance. That action added to an understanding among many employees that Mr. Rubio does not actually support such programs.</p></div></div>
