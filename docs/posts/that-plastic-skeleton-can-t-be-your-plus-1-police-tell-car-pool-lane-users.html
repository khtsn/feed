He issued a ticket.</p><p>“While <strong>#</strong>spookyseason is upon us,” a message posted to the agency’s social media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CHPSanJose/posts/pfbid02SbVtfRcYUAzexGL6gKoyMggVy2hTk8WzpgFtWZggp2yfngkgS7uGZcTA5nftRSKKl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a>, “it’s important to remember that decorations being transported in the passenger seat do not qualify to meet carpool requirements.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Pictures of an officer handing the driver the citation accompanied the message.
