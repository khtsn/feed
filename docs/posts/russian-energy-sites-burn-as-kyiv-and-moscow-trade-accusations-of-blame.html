Russian officials said the fire had spread to more than 100,000 square feet.</p><p>Kyiv and Moscow agreed this week to a limited 30-day cease-fire on strikes against energy infrastructure — the first major step toward de-escalation in more than three years of war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But the details of how and when this partial truce would take hold remain unresolved and are expected to be hammered out in U.S.-mediated talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Ukrainian national railway said its power system <a href="https://t.me/UkrzalInfo/6646" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had been attacked</a>. The same day, Russia said Ukrainian drones <a href="https://t.me/opershtab23/12797" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attacked the fuel depot</a> in the Krasnodar region. Neither of the claims could be independently verified.</p><p>Both sides have an interest in blaming the other for violating the cease-fire before it even begins, seeking to portray their opponent as untrustworthy. Against that backdrop, Friday’s attack on the Russian gas station fit neatly into this propaganda war.</p><p>The gas station sits just across the border from Ukraine, near the town of Sudzha, in territory that Ukrainian forces seized during their incursion into Russia’s western Kursk region last summer. But recent Russian advances have pushed back Ukrainian troops in the area from all but a sliver of land, and it was unclear whether they still controlled the station as of Friday.</p><p>Russia’s Investigative Committee, the country’s main federal investigative body, announced on Friday that it had opened <a href="https://t.me/sledcom_press/19857" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a criminal investigation</a> of the event. It said Ukrainian troops had “carried out a deliberate explosion of the Sudzha gas distribution station” causing “significant damage.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Ukrainian Army, though, suggested the explosion was a Russian “false flag” operation designed to put the blame on Ukraine. It said Russia had “repeatedly shelled” the station in the past as it counterattacked Ukrainian troops in the area.</p><p>“Russians continue to create numerous fakes and seek to mislead the international community,” the army said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1HhuUNPQpT/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>.</p><p>Ivan Nechepurenko<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
