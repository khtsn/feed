    <h1>DOGE Quietly Deletes the 5 Biggest Spending Cuts It Celebrated Last Week</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Elon Musk’s government cost-slashing initiative, dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, posted an online “wall of receipts,” celebrating how much it had saved by canceling federal contracts.</p><p>Now the organization, which is also known as the U.S. DOGE Service, has deleted all of the five biggest “savings” on that original list, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/upshot/doge-musk-trump-errors.html" title="">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-doge-federal-savings-claims-783b9507?st=kwMKEz&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other media outlets</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302705/doge-overstates-savings-federal-contracts" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pointed out</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-wall-of-receipts-shows-errors-tallying-billions-in-savings/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they were riddled</a> <a href="https://css.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/22/doge-savings-found-list-analysis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with errors</a>.</p><p>The last of the original top five disappeared from the site in the early hours of Tuesday, even as the group claimed in its latest update that its savings to date had increased to $65 billion. The website offered no explanation for why it removed some items or how it arrived at the higher total. Neither the U.S. DOGE Service nor the White House responded to questions Tuesday morning.</p><p>The “wall of receipts” is the only public ledger the organization has produced to document its work. The scale of that ledger’s errors — and the misunderstandings and poor quality control that seemed to underlie them — has raised questions about the effort’s broader work, which has led to mass firings and cutbacks across the federal government.</p></div></div>
