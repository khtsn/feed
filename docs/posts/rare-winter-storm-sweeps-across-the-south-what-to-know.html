While Tennessee is familiar with winter storms, some areas, like Memphis, could receive their largest two-day snow totals in 40 years. Parts of the state are still recovering from Helene, which moved through the state as a tropical storm in September.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
