With the northern half of Georgia under a winter storm warning, Gov. Brian P. Kemp declared a state of emergency <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2025-01-09/gov-kemp-declares-statewide-state-emergency-ahead-winter-weather" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Thursday</a> because of the forecast and said it would be in place through Tuesday. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The governor asked residents to avoid travel as much as possible in the next few days. “Hazardous conditions, including ice and snow, can develop quickly and make travel very dangerous,” he said in a statement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee also announced a <a href="https://www.tn.gov/tema/news/2025/1/9/gov--lee--tema-issue-state-of-emergency-ahead-of-winter-weather.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state of emergency</a> on Thursday afternoon. While Tennessee is familiar with winter storms, some areas, like Memphis, could receive their largest two-day snow totals in 40 years. Parts of the state are still recovering from Helene, which moved through the state as a tropical storm in September.</p><p>Forecasters in Nashville urged residents not to focus on the precise levels of snowfall, as any amount could make travel risky.</p><p>In Atlanta, it has been nearly 11 years since a small snowstorm, locally referred to as snowmageddon, shut down the city and became a <a href="https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-buford-calloway/2752754" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">punchline for a “Saturday Night Live” skit</a>.</p><p>While snow has fallen in the city since then, the latest storm could still catch people off guard as the type of precipitation changes through the day. What is expected to start as snow Friday morning is likely to turn to sleet and then freezing rain across the Atlanta metropolitan area, threatening to turn untreated roads into icy hazards by the evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Across North Carolina, a similar scenario will begin to unfold around midday Friday and last overnight into Saturday. Accumulations of up to two inches are currently expected in the Mid-Atlantic area east of the Allegheny Mountains.</p><p>The storm is then expected to move off the coast, where it will strengthen but remain far enough away to avoid being a major hazard for the Northeast.</p><p>Unusual cold across the East Coast is expected to continue into next week, allowing for some snow to stick around. And where the snow has melted during the day, it may refreeze at night, creating ongoing hazards.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
