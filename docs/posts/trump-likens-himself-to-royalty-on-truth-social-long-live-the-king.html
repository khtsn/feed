    <h1>Trump Likens Himself to Royalty on Truth Social: ‘Long Live the King’</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Trump has been vocal in his opposition to congestion pricing, which charges most drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, saying it was harmful to the city’s economy. He vowed during the election to halt it when he entered office. In an interview with The New York Post earlier this month, he characterized the toll as being “destructive” to New York.</p><p>“If I decide to do it, I will be able to kill it off in Washington through the Department of Transportation,” Mr. Trump said in the interview.</p><p>On Wednesday, the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, made good on the president’s wishes. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/nyregion/trump-congestion-pricing-nyc.html" title="">laid out Mr. Trump’s objection</a>s to the program in a letter sent to Gov. Kathy Hochul and said that federal officials would contact the state to “discuss the orderly cessation of toll operations.”</p><p>“I share the president’s concerns about the impacts to working-class Americans who now have an additional financial burden to account for in their daily lives,” Mr. Duffy wrote.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s first month back in the White House has been full of moments where he has invoked almost monarchical power. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration.html" title="">In his Inaugural Address</a>, he said God had saved him when a would-be assassin made an attempt on his life in order “to make America great again.”</p></div></div>
