			<p>100 thieves is tough because on paper they are a good team. Everyone on the team is top 4 americas in their role, but the problem was that their a one map team. I really think the coaching failed this team where for the last 2 years the map pool gets carried by lucky map vetoes and having only 1 great map. Coaching staff was the real problem so good riddance, I hope Zikz reunites with Potter as they obviously compliment each other. As for the players, I actually agree with the GM here that Eeiu should definitely stay, the others are great but the role swaps you have to do to cater to asuna and Cryo for their skill is tough and is very limiting, so I understand that. If you just find a cracked T2 duelist who can op and entry on the top duelists you don&#39;t need both cryo and asuna to fill that. Zander was very inconsistent as a smoker compared to his tenure in M80, and Kess was alright probably didnt get enough time to be comfortable on the roster plus had to flex a shit ton.</p>
<p>I think you gotta start with a great coach and some tier 2 talent and we can have something here. There&#39;s a lot of NA coaches that are doing great work in other regions, so would love to see them get poached. Elevated and mCe are at global and would flourish in NA, Frost contract ended with Talon, Vitality coach could be poached as well, heck Doombros would be a great shout. </p>
<p>As for players all the players on the roster should get trials they&#39;re all great individually. But Cryo is definitely getting bought out, personally if I&#39;m sentinels I&#39;m making Zellsis an AC like babybay and getting him and developing him to be an insane Sentinel player. Reuniting Cryo with Zekken and bang is just perfection. You are losing out on vibes, but we see with G2 if babybay is AC everyone gets riled up so Zellsis can do the same. Especially chamber being back too, it&#39;s a no brainer honestly. The question is what&#39;s happening with Reduxx, idk keep him in t2 for another year or sell him to 100T.</p>
<p>Kess i have no care where he goes, Asuna I&#39;m ngl i have 0 clue it might have to be EG, his peers in C9, Sen, and NRG are just better, and I know he says he can flex but why would you get asuna just to have him be a sentinel or smokes player? Zander is a good IGL I truly believe that he has way too much experience from it in M80 just bad 100T gameplans, and not enough time. Could see him at EG but I&#39;d take supamen over him so prolly back to tier 2.</p>
<p>As for what platers to get in 100T, keep eeiu, win the Yay sweepstakes and keep him on perma sentinel or double duelist as yoru (have him watch something vods). Okeanos on smokes, or super flex. And then some cracked out  T2 duelist who just turned 18 (Timotino or maybe even Penny since Apeks didnt work out), and then IGL i have 0 clue, maybe a punt on Tdawgg he grinds a ton, and is a huge vod watcher.</p>		</div></div>
