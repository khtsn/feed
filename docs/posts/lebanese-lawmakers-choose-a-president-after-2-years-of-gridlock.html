    <h1>Lebanese Lawmakers Choose a President After 2 Years of Gridlock</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lebanon’s international backers, including the United States, have implied that postwar financial support is contingent on the election of a president. According to the World Bank, the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has been suspended during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-ceasefire.html" title="">fragile 60-day cease-fire</a>, has cost Lebanon <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099111224112085259/pdf/P5063801c62fbe0c21beff1d0a436d07e02.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$8.5 billion in damages</a>.</p><p>Since October 2022, when Michel Aoun stepped down as president at the end of his six-year term, the Parliament has failed in 12 previous votes to elect a successor. But Hezbollah, long a dominant political force in Lebanon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-nasrallah-assassination-intelligence.html" title="">was deeply weakened</a> by the war with Israel and analysts noted that the group likely felt it had to make concessions because of the scale of Lebanon’s financial need.</p><p>The new president, who is not related to Michel Aoun, is considered by analysts to have U.S. backing and is widely respected in Lebanon. He has led the country’s armed forces since 2017, a role that placed him at the helm of the single national institution that enjoys cross-sectarian support.</p><p>“He is seen as an acceptable figure by all of Lebanon’s political elite,” said Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. <strong>“</strong>This is tied to the perception in Lebanon that the Lebanese army is an institution working in the national interest.”</p><p>Diplomats hope Mr. Aoun’s stature will allow him to exercise continued influence over the military and lead to the full implementation of the U.N. Security Council’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/middleeast/un-resolution-1701-explained.html" title="">Resolution 1701</a> — a 2006 agreement that ended the previous Israel-Hezbollah war but failed to keep the peace. They hope it will be a blueprint for a longer-term peace once the current cease-fire ends.</p></div></div>
