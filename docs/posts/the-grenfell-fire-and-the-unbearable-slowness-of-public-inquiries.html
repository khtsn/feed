And London’s Metropolitan Police Department has said that it will need a further 12 to 18 months to determine whether to bring criminal charges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“If one was being very cynical, one could argue that this is kind of the point of doing these very long inquiries,” said Sam Freedman, a former adviser to a Conservative government minister and the author of the book “<a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/sam-freedman/failed-state/9781035026593" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Failed State</a>: Why Nothing Works and How We Fix It.”</p><p>Because such inquiries take a long time, “by the time you get to publication, the people who are named as being responsible aren’t in power,” he said, and public anger has dissipated. There are still some political costs from opening an inquiry, Freedman said, but they’re far lower than more immediate and concrete policy responses would be.</p><p>It’s not difficult to see why that approach might be appealing for politicians. It’s less obvious why the public is willing to accept it.</p><p>Yet the scandal-inquiry-delay sequence appears to have become one of the British government’s go-to responses to outrageous harm. There were 69 public inquiries started between 1990 and 2017, compared with only 19 in the previous 30 years, according to the <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/public-inquiries" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institute for Government</a>, a London-based research group.</p><p>The Grenfell inquiry was speedy in comparison to the <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/infected-blood-scandal-background-impacts-interim-compensation-and-inquiry-outcomes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infected Blood Inquiry</a>, which released its final report this year on harmful blood transfusions administered between the 1970s and 1990s. The 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster#" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hillsborough disaster</a> spurred multiple inquiries, the latest of which issued its report in 2012.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Grenfell fire was one of the biggest public scandals of the last decade in Britain. The story commanded so much newspaper coverage that you could have measured it by the yard, including investigations that revealed much of the malfeasance detailed in the inquiry’s final report. Not only was the harm to those who lost their lives or family members catastrophic, but the radius of the disaster&#39;s impact extended far beyond the tower. The cladding that had caused the fire to burn out of control had also been used on other buildings. Ordinary homeowners were faced with massive bills to replace the materials.</p><p>Yet the tragedy did not lead to resignations at high levels of government, or criminal prosecutions. The flammable cladding is still on thousands of buildings, stuck in place by a battle over who should pay for its removal. Some specific policies were introduced after the fire, but many were too narrow to tackle the broader dangers that the fire revealed.</p><p>Freedman, during our conversation, imagined an alternative timeline in which the government acted decisively. “What you could have done is say, ‘Now we’re going to prioritize this above a dozen other policies that we previously said were very important. We’re going to put 20 billion quid into fixing all the cladding. We’re going to put in an emergency program to hire all the people we need to do it,’” he said.</p><p>But, he added, “It’s easier to say ‘We’ll do an inquiry,’ and make this the next government’s problem.”</p><h2 id="link-6917bb3">The unpredictable power of scandal</h2><p>It is always difficult to figure out why something didn’t happen. But one explanation for why the government was able to avoid the kind of decisive action Freedman described is that the reaction to the scandal, while substantial, did not really connect with an existing, broader movement for change. “There needs to be an underlying movement for reform, which seizes on an outrageous scandal,” Alice Evans, a researcher at King’s College, London, told me via email. That can take the form of an organized campaign or widespread pent-up demand for change, but it forms the gear that connects outrage to consequences.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>When those circumstances are present, scandals can be one of the most formidable forces in public life, unifying opinion and propelling change.</p><p>The best example of that from recent years is #MeToo, when a wave of revelations of sexual misconduct swept powerful men from their positions in politics, the media and other industries. Crucially, the #MeToo movement had been building long before the Harvey Weinstein scandal became the focus of outrage. The activist Tarana Burke coined the slogan “Me too” a decade earlier, as a way for women to show solidarity with victims and illuminate the scale of the problem. Demand for change had been building for even longer, as the lack of consequences for sexual misconduct became increasingly discordant with women’s growing power and presence in public life.</p><p>By contrast, the Grenfell tragedy did not connect with a powerful, existing movement for reform. Housing is a major issue in Britain, but the political and media debate tends to focus more on how hard it is to buy a house than on the safety of the rental housing supply. (Even less of the focus is on public housing, which most of the Grenfell units were.)</p><p>It didn’t help that the fire occurred in 2017, a particularly messy era for British politics. The Conservative government, led by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/world/europe/uk-theresa-may-minority-government.html" title="">weak prime minister</a>, Theresa May, was consumed by infighting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/europe/uk-brexit-theresa-may.html" title="">over Brexit</a>, and was unlikely to want to rake over the <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/archive/cameron-claims-victory-in-bonfire-of-the-building-regulations" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slashing of building regulations</a> that the party had championed just a few years before.</p><p>All this is not to say that public inquiries have no value. They can give a voice to people who might struggle to be heard, and to expose malfeasance by powerful people and corporations. The Grenfell inquiry, for instance, revealed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56115167" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">email chains</a> that demonstrated that manufacturers and sellers of deadly cladding and insulation had engaged in “deliberate and sustained strategies to manipulate the testing processes, misrepresent test data, and mislead the market.” That is now part of a permanent public record.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But for many harmed by the fire, that was not enough. At a news conference last week, family members of those who died expressed their sorrow and outrage, and demanded criminal charges.</p><p>“This inquiry hasn’t taught me anything. In fact, it’s delayed the justice that my family deserves. And the only person I can blame for that is the government,” said Hisam Choucair, who lost six family members in the fire.</p><p>“This inquiry was forced on us,” he said. “To some it gives answers. To some it doesn’t do anything, except it’s put that extra nail in the coffin, as they say. Or in the heart.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>9</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Grenfell Report Shows Failings of Public Inquiries<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
