and second, a series of measures in mid-April that would target farm products and industrial goods that are important to Republican districts.</p><p>European leaders have made it clear that they would prefer not to enact those measures, and would like to come to an agreement with Mr. Trump instead.</p><p>“Tariffs are taxes,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_752" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Wednesday. But with little progress toward a deal, E.U. leaders had decided to hit back in politically sensitive product categories, hoping to inflict enough pain to drive Americans to the negotiation table.</p><p>The European Union’s trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, will have calls with his United States counterparts on Friday, a commission representative said. Mr. Sefcovic, who oversees trade issues in the bloc, will speak with both Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative.</p><p>The European Commission, which most directly drives trade policy for the economies in the bloc, did not otherwise comment on Mr. Trump’s post.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But many European officials had anticipated that Washington might react, and some vowed on Thursday not to cave under that pressure.</p><p>“We will not give in to threats,” Laurent Saint-Martin, France’s foreign trade minister, <a href="https://x.com/LaurentSMartin/status/1900169739302776980" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a post</a> on X. Mr. Trump “is escalating the trade war he chose to unleash,” he added.</p><p>This is not the first time the spirits and alcohol industry has been caught in a trans-Atlantic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/business/economy/whiskey-tariffs.html" title="">trade war</a>. Less extreme tariffs were placed on liquor and other alcohol during Mr. Trump’s first term, and the industry’s recovery from that hit has been long and grueling.</p><p>Back then, the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/business/trump-tariff-france.html" title="">threatened</a> champagne with tariffs, but did not follow through.</p><p>While it is not clear how much it mattered in that case, Bernard Arnault, France’s richest man and head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-attendees.html" title="">attended</a> the president’s recent inauguration.</p><p>Mr. Arnault’s company is home to brands including Dom Pérignon, Krug and Veuve Clicquot.</p><p>This time around, a range of alcohol industry executives have been lobbying in Washington, Brussels and other European capitals to be spared — and have expressed alarm that they are once again caught in the crossfire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ulrich Adam, director general of the trade group SpiritsEurope, called Mr. Trump’s tariff threat on European alcohol a “shocker.” The group aims “to get spirits out of the middle of these unrelated disputes,” he added.</p><p>There seems to be little hope of an immediate reprieve. Mr. Trump stressed that the tariffs “will be great for the wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.”</p><p>Champagne, technically, is <a href="https://www.champagne.fr/en/about-champagne/a-great-blended-wine/the-champagne-region" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produced</a> only in a specific region in France. About 16 percent of its total exports go to the United States, based on <a href="https://maisons-champagne.com/en/industry/sustainable-development/economy/the-champagne-houses-and-their-grandes-marques/article/exports-2023#:~:text=Exports%20to%20the%20United%20States,%3A%2026%2C92%20million%20bottles." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industry data from 2023</a>, making America the largest importer of the sparkling wine.</p><p>About <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20231116-1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a fifth</a> of wine exports from the European Union go to the United States, based on data from Eurostat. America is a top export market for everything from bottles of Bordeaux to Cognacs.</p><p>Industry experts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trumps-tariff-threat-sends-french-wine-and-champagne-makers-reeling.html" title="">warned on Thursday</a> that such steep tariffs would crush trade between Europe and the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This is the second time this week that Mr. Trump has threatened to rapidly escalate a trade war against a close ally.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to double the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum after the province of Ontario responded to his previous tariffs by putting a surcharge on electricity it exported to the United States.</p><p>Within hours, Ontario had suspended its surcharge, and Mr. Trump also walked back his threats. On Wednesday, he proceeded to tax Canadian steel and aluminum at the same 25 percent rate as other countries.</p><p>Governments have varied their responses to Mr. Trump’s tariff threats.</p><p>China, the European Union and Canada have quickly answered Mr. Trump’s tariffs with levies of their own, encouraged by their domestic political constituencies to fight back or emboldened by leverage based on the size of their economies.</p><p>But governments in Australia, Brazil, Britain, Japan and Mexico have chosen not to retaliate, at least for now, as they seek a deal with Mr. Trump.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Lutnick, the commerce secretary, warned other countries in an interview on Bloomberg TV Thursday against retaliating against the United States.</p><p>“If you make him unhappy, he responds unhappy,” Mr. Lutnick said.</p><p>Mr. Lutnick said that some countries, like Britain and Mexico, had thoughtfully examined how they did business with the United States. But for countries that respond with further tariffs, “the president’s going to deal with them with strength and with power,” he threatened.</p><p>Liz Alderman<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ana Swanson covers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.
