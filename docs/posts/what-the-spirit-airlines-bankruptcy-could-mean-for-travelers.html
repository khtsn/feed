Many companies, including major airlines, have emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy — a process that allows a company to financially restructure while still operating — on stronger footing.</p><p>Spirit filed for bankruptcy protection after it recently failed to renegotiate its debt. It had struggled to capitalize on the recovery from the pandemic, in part because of engine problems and increased competition, and was dealt a blow after a federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/business/jetblue-spirit-airlines-ruling-merger.html" title="">blocked a planned merger with JetBlue Airways</a> this year.</p><p>Here’s what else travelers should know about the bankruptcy filing:</p><h2 id="link-7daae8ec">What’s next in Spirit’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy?</h2><p>Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York, which will allow the company to continue to operate as it restructures its debts under court supervision. Often called reorganization bankruptcy, this process grants a company legal protection as it looks to cut costs and reduce its total debt.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Spirit had 25,000 to 50,000 creditors and total debt of about $9 billion at end of September, according to a court filing.</p><p>The company said it expected to exit the bankruptcy process in the first quarter of next year. In the meantime, Spirit has an agreement with bondholders to restructure its debts and raise money to help it operate, the company said. The airline insisted it would “emerge even better positioned” after the bankruptcy proceedings wrapped up.</p><p>Spirit’s Chapter 11 filing is the first by a major airline in more than a decade. But it’s far from unusual: Airlines have filed for bankruptcy more than 180 times in recent decades, according to data from Airlines for America, a trade group. That includes American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, three of the biggest companies in the industry, all of which are still operating and have reported profits in recent quarters.</p><p>“The filing of the bankruptcy is not necessarily the failing of the business,” said Edward Janger, a professor of bankruptcy law at Brooklyn Law School.</p><h2 id="link-6492a6c4">Will my flight be affected?</h2><p>People traveling with Spirit should not expect major disruptions to their plans in the coming weeks. For now, there is no indication that the airline’s operations will be severely disrupted because of the bankruptcy process, a reassurance for the millions of Americans who will be traveling for Thanksgiving.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In an open letter released on Monday, the airline said that customers could “use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal.” Frequent-flier miles should also be protected.</p><p>But travelers should generally be aware of potential cutbacks to service as the company looks to slash costs and reduce its operating footprint. That might not come as a surprise to those who have turned to Spirit for low-cost fares in recent months; the company has already started to scale back its operations. Spirit’s recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/business/spirit-airlines-airbus-pilots.html" title="">cost-cutting measures</a> have included delaying delivery of new Airbus planes and furloughing pilots. Any additional steps to save money would add to those already in effect.</p><p>In the event that a Spirit flight is canceled, travelers are entitled to refunds under guidelines <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/what-airline-passengers-need-know-about-dots-automatic-refund-rule" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finalized</a> by the Department of Transportation this year. Fliers are also eligible for refunds for significant flight delays: more than three hours on a domestic trip or six hours on an international one.</p><p>Spirit could try again to merge with another airline, especially given expectations that the incoming Trump administration could ease up on antitrust enforcement, including scrutiny of airline deals. But any fresh acquisition bid is unlikely to affect travelers in the near future.</p><p>“To the extent that they’re able to find an appropriate merger partner, there’s every reason to think their operations would continue without interruption,” Mr. Janger said.</p><p>Niraj Chokshi<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Danielle Kaye is a business reporter and a 2024 David Carr Fellow, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/danielle-kaye">More about Danielle Kaye</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>5</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>What Travelers Should Know About the Airline’s Financial Straits<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Bluesky’s Rapid Growth: </strong>The fledgling social media platform, an alternative to X and Facebook, has been flooded with new users since the election. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/technology/bluesky-growing-pains.html">It hasn’t all been easy</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Table Tennis Olympian’s Broken Promises: </strong>Michael Hyatt used his charisma to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/business/michael-hyatt-table-tennis-fraud.html">persuade a string of women to open up their homes and wallets</a>, leaving them disillusioned, bitter and in debt.</p></li><li><p><strong>Substack’s Political Experiment: </strong>The newsletter start-up, which once drew an overture from Elon Musk, is betting on politics content and recruiting stars. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/business/media/substack-politics-newsletters.html">But profits remain elusive</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Cost of Late-in-Life Divorce:</strong> As the number of couples who split after the age of 50 rises, more Americans are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/business/divorce-retirement-savings.html">looking at a retirement that is drastically different</a> than they had expected.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of Niche Streamers:</strong> The streaming wars didn’t kill smaller streaming services like Hallmark+ and BritBox. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/business/media/hallmark-britbox-streaming-growth.html">In fact, they’re thriving</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
