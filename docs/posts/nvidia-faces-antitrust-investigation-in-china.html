In response, the Chinese government last week announced it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html" title="">ban the export</a> of several rare minerals to the United States and imposed sanctions on more than a dozen U.S. defense firms and defense industry executives.</p><p>Together, the moves by Beijing signal its willingness to engage in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/business/china-retaliation-skydio.html" title="">supply chain warfare</a> as the policy contest over trade and the control of technology escalates between the world’s two largest economies.</p><p>The battle has made A.I. chips into one of the world’s most sought-after technologies, and Nvidia has cornered the market, accounting for 90 percent of global sales by the end of last year. Nvidia’s dominance helped it become one of the most valuable companies in the world over the past year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday that it was investigating Nvidia for violating commitments made during its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company that makes computer networking equipment. The Chinese regulator approved Nvidia’s acquisition of the company in 2020 with conditions to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure supplies to China.</p><p>Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Monday’s announcement.</p><p>As the Biden administration has progressively tightened restrictions on Nvidia’s chip sales to China, Nvidia had responded by offering less powerful versions of its chips to the Chinese market.</p><p>The officials in Washington who have sought to control China’s access to advanced computer chips say the technology is essential not just for smartphones and chatbots but also for military superiority. They have tried to prevent Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and the machines to make them.</p><p>Chinese tech companies have resorted to stockpiling the chips and relied on a vast network of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/technology/china-ai-microchips.html" title="">smugglers and front companies</a>. At the same time, Beijing is pouring large sums of money into its own chip companies in an attempt to make its tech sector less reliant on foreign technology.</p><p>The Chinese government has previously used legal investigations to register displeasure with foreign companies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In October, a think tank with ties to China’s internet regulatory agency called for a review of Intel, the American chip company, for selling products that “constantly harmed” China’s national security and interests. The last company subject to a cybersecurity review was the American chip maker Micron, which was ultimately cut off from supplying chips to a significant portion of the Chinese market.</p><p>No Chinese company has been able to make chips as advanced as Nvidia’s.</p><p>Nvidia’s revenue from China has been growing fast, but it has become less important to the company overall: The share of Nvidia’s sales in China fell to 13 percent in the first nine months of its current fiscal year, down from 22 percent last year.</p><p>In 2015, American chip maker Qualcomm paid a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/business/international/qualcomm-fine-china-antitrust-investigation.html" title="">$975 million fine</a> and agreed to license its technology to Chinese companies at a discount after the Chinese government investigated it for antimonopoly violations.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/meaghan-tobin">More about Meaghan Tobin</a></span></p></div><div><p>John Liu covers China and technology for The Times, focusing primarily on the interplay between politics and technology supply chains.
