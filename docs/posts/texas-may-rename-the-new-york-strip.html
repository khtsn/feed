Everybody agrees, though, that the nomenclature wasn’t the least bit controversial until last Friday, when Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas proposed a new name: the Texas strip.</p><p>Noting that Texas leads the nation in heads of cattle, Mr. Patrick announced in <a href="https://x.com/DanPatrick/status/1895599626939744566" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post on X</a> that he was working with the State Senate on a resolution that would officially rebrand the cut.</p><p>Mr. Patrick was clear in his post that he hoped the Texas-centric name would give a boost to his state’s cattle ranchers. At the same time, the way he framed the issue carried more than a whiff of red-meat politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Liberal New York shouldn’t get the credit for our hard-working ranchers,” he wrote.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Liberal New Yorkers shouldn’t get credit for our hard-working ranchers,” wrote Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas in a post announcing a proposal to rename the New York strip steak in his state.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Christopher Lee for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Meatpackers and steakhouses in New York seem disinclined to follow Texas’s lead.</p><p>“Oh my God, its so ridiculous,” said Harry Sinanaj, president of <a href="https://www.benandjackssteakhouse.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ben &amp; Jack’s Steakhouse</a> on East 44th Street. “Even if they change it, I’m going to leave it as the New York strip.”</p><p>The term’s exact origins are obscure, but it is often tied to <a href="https://www.theoriginaldelmonicos.com/our-history/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Delmonico’s</a>, founded in 1827 and regarded as the first restaurant in the United States. The cut known as a Delmonico steak may have once referred to a strip steak, although on the current menu it’s used to mean a rib-eye. In any case, the cut caught on around the city.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-6a6ba3d2"><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016334-cast-iron-steak" title="">Cast-Iron Steak Recipe</a></h2><hr/><p>“I don’t think there’s room for politics in this,” said Dennis Turcinovic, the owner and managing partner of Delmonico’s Hospitality Group. “It’s American culinary history.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Patrick is not the first politician to attempt a rebranding of a popular food item. Before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, cafeterias in the House of Representatives began selling “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/12/us/threats-responses-washington-talk-order-fries-please-but-hold-french.html" title="">freedom fries</a>” to protest France’s opposition to an attack. Anti-German sentiment during World War I led to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1918/04/25/archives/sauerkraut-may-be-liberty-cabbage-dealers-think-camouflaged-name-is.html" title="">liberty cabbage</a>” for sauerkraut. Neither name outlasted its political moment.</p><p>The term New York strip is so well established that it is enshrined in “<a href="https://www.usfoods.com/content/dam/usf/pdf/general/Meat-Buyers-guide.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Meat Buyer’s Guide</a>,” a longstanding industry bible put out by the Meat Institute, a trade group based on Washington. The book lists “Lomo, Strip Loin (New York), Deshuesado” as synonyms for the boneless strip loin.</p><p>“When restaurants call you on the phone and say, ‘Give me one New York strip,’ I know they mean the boneless strip loin,” said Mark Solasz, vice president of <a href="https://www.masterpurveyors.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Master Purveyors</a>, a wholesaler in the Bronx.</p><p>“Maybe the Texans will change it to the Texas strip, but I don’t think New York is going to change,” Mr. Solasz said. “I don’t think this one is going to cross the border.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I don’t think this one is going to cross the border,” Mark Solasz, vice president of Master Purveyors in the Bronx, said of the Texan proposal.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Marc and Greg Sherry, who own the longest-running steakhouse in the city, <a href="https://www.theoldhomesteadsteakhouse.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Old Homestead</a> on Ninth Avenue, are so proud of the cut that they call it “Sherry Brothers 16 oz. New York prime sirloin” on their menu.</p><p>“I guess the lieutenant governor is looking for some P.R., but a New York steak is a New York steak,” Greg Sherry said.</p><p>Mr. Sinanaj, who was raised in Montenegro when Yugoslavia was still under Communist rule, recalled his mother’s telling him about a man in their village who went to jail for criticizing the government after he complained that a loaf of bread he’d bought was stale. Putting a partisan spin on a steak’s name rubs him the wrong way, he said.</p><p>“In my personal opinion it’s ridiculous to call it liberal or conservative,” he said. “The people’s stomach has nothing to do with politics.”</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Pete Wells was the restaurant critic for The Times from 2012 until 2024.
