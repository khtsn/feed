    <h1>Mahathir Mohamad, 99, Reflects on a Contentious Legacy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>At the National Mosque in Kuala Lumpur on a recent Friday, a crowd of men angled for an close-up look at the silver-haired figure in a gray suit exiting an elevator.</p><p>They held their camera phones up high and perched on stairs to catch a better glimpse. Those who could get close enough stepped forward to kiss the man’s hand. A worshiper put his hand to his head in a salute.</p><p>The man commanding all this attention was Mahathir Mohamad, 99, who served more years as prime minister than anyone in Malaysia’s history.</p><p>Starting in 1981, he governed uninterrupted for 22 years, engineering an economic transformation that reshaped the country from one dependent on tin, rubber and palm oil into one of the world’s major high-tech exporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Then in 2018, after a 15-year break, he was elected again at 92, setting a record as the world’s oldest prime minister.</p><p>But he remains a deeply polarizing figure, reviled by many for clamping down hard on his political opponents — most notoriously, Anwar Ibrahim, the current prime minister — and for his incendiary comments about Jews and race in Malaysia.</p><p>Western governments, including the United States, condemned what happened to Mr. Anwar when his mentor led the country. Mr. Mahathir fired Mr. Anwar as deputy prime minister in 1998, and his No. 2 was imprisoned for years on corruption and sodomy charges, severely beaten and widely considered a political prisoner.</p><p>And for all the praise he won for Malaysia’s economic transformation, Mr. Mahathir was also subject to much less-flattering assessments. He has been called Machiavellian, a dictator, an autocrat and an antisemite.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/15/multimedia/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-03-ltmj/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-03-ltmj-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Mr. Mahathir praying at the National Mosque of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, in February.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/15/multimedia/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-02-ltmj/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-02-ltmj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/15/multimedia/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-02-ltmj/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-02-ltmj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/15/multimedia/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-02-ltmj/00Malaysia-Mahathir-Legacy-Interview-02-ltmj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The spires of the Petronas Towers rising into the night sky, above a group of four women wearing head scarves in the foreground.

But he said he became appalled when the formation of Israel resulted in the expulsion and killing of Palestinians.</p><p>“When I criticize the Jews for doing wrong things, bad things and oppressive things, they label me as an anti-Jew,” he said. “I’m pointing out that what they were doing is wrong; that is all.”</p><p>Some analysts have characterized such offensive tirades, like blaming Jews collectively for what he sees as the failings of Israeli state policy, as a way for him to pander to a domestic audience that has long supported the Palestinian cause. Others suggested they were a way for Mr. Mahathir, who has long called for Islam to coexist with the modern world, to bolster his own religious bona fides. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Mahathir in his office.

He championed the idea of Malay supremacy and gave lucrative business opportunities to select Malay businessmen, which critics called cronyism.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Still, he often hectored his fellow Malays, calling them lazy. During the interview, he made the same sort of sweeping statements that had been a characteristic of his time in office: “The Malays don’t work as hard as the other races,” he said, while noting that “the Chinese are very hard working, and they are very materialistic.”</p><p>Whatever his final legacy, Mr. Mahathir is determined to add to it.</p><p>Five years after stepping down in 2020 from his second stint as prime minister, he still wields influence and dominates headlines.</p><p>One obsession keeps him going.</p><p>“Before I die, for as much as I can function,” Mr. Mahathir said, “I would like to continue my work in trying to contribute to the growth of Malaysia.”</p><p>In front of him on his desk was a letter asking him to intervene in Malaysia’s current economic problems. Next to it was a clipboard with his latest essay in longhand for his blog. (It started: “Poor Ukraine.”) Beyond his right shoulder was the Formula One helmet that he received as a gift in September when he drove around a racetrack, clocking 96 miles an hour.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Every weekday, he is in the office by 8:30 a.m. and works for about nine hours, sometimes 12.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali at home in Putrajaya.

He sent her to lead diplomatic delegations when she was first lady, like a trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Iraq</a> to assess the effect of the United Nations’ economic sanctions on women and children. It resulted in a secret meeting with Saddam Hussein.</p><p>“There were so many times he believed in me,” she said.</p><p>Mr. Mahathir thinks a lot about aging and what it means for leadership. Old people should still contribute to politics, he said — but not all old people. Last year, he said that Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom he had initially backed for the U.S. presidency, should step down.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“Although he is younger than me, he looked and behaved like an old person,” Mr. Mahathir said during the interview.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Although he has given up horse riding, Mr. Mahathir still regularly rides on a tandem bike.

He criticized two of his protégés for what he said were economic mismanagement and personal failings. But it was a quest to defeat one of them, Najib Razak, then prime minister, that gave rise to Mr. Mahathir’s remarkable second act in politics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Sometime in 2014, Malaysians started visiting Mr. Mahathir’s office to vent about Mr. Najib’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/world/asia/malaysia-najib-rosmah-1mdb.html" title="">mismanaging of a state investment fund</a>, 1 Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, according to Endie Shazlie Akbar, Mr. Mahathir’s former press secretary.</p><p>“It was almost like people were going to Jimmy Carter to complain about Donald Trump,” Mr. Endie said.</p><p>Mr. Mahathir called on Mr. Najib to resign, attended nationwide demonstrations and decided, finally, that he not only had to come out of retirement, but also that he would team up with his longtime nemesis: Mr. Anwar.</p><p>Together, the odd couple won the election, and Mr. Mahathir was once again prime minister.</p><p>But the bonhomie lasted only two years, after which Mr. Mahathir’s political party defected from the winning coalition and he resigned as premier for the second time.</p><p>His feud with Mr. Anwar continues to reverberate today. The Malaysian government is considering <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-inquiry-proposes-criminal-probe-against-ex-pm-mahathir-state-media-2024-12-05/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a criminal investigation</a> into Mr. Mahathir over a territorial settlement with Singapore, in which he withdrew Malaysia’s attempt to challenge a previous ruling on three islets.
