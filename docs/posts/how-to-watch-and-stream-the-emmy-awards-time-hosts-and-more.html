Here’s how to watch on Sunday:</p><h2 id="link-1a030ceb">What time does the show start?</h2><p>The ceremony begins at 8 p.m. Eastern (5 p.m. Pacific) and will be held at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Unlike the Oscars, the Emmys usually finish on schedule, in about three hours.</p><h2 id="link-3b3fe01a">Where can I watch?</h2><p>ABC is broadcasting the ceremony, making it simple to watch for anyone with access to network television. Online options are a bit trickier. There are plenty of streaming services that have ABC, including YouTube TV or Fubo, but you will need a subscription to those distributors.</p><p>The Emmys will eventually stream on Hulu, but with a significant catch: The ceremony will not be available until Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-2326bcf1">What’s eligible?</h2><p>Shows that premiered from June 2023 to May 2024. This is why the second season of “The Bear,” which premiered last year, is nominated for Sunday’s event, rather than the third season, which debuted three months ago.</p><p>“Shogun” (25) and “The Bear” (23) lead the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/arts/television/emmy-nominees-list-2024.html" title="">list of nominees</a>.</p><h2 id="link-73261f6e">Who’s hosting?</h2><p>The father-and-son duo of Dan and Eugene Levy, the creators of “Schitt’s Creek.” The Levys are familiar faces to award show viewers: “Schitt’s Creek” won big at the Emmys in September 2020, held virtually because of the pandemic, and Dan Levy became the first performer to collect four Emmys during a prime-time telecast (for writing, directing, best supporting actor and best comedy).</p><h2 id="link-2239593a">When is the red carpet?</h2><p>The cable network E! will air a red carpet show that begins at 6 p.m. Eastern and will be hosted by Laverne Cox, the comedian Heather McMahan and the E! host Keltie Knight.</p><p>ABC has a red carpet show of its own; it begins at 7 p.m. Eastern and will be hosted by the veteran anchor Robin Roberts and the ABC News correspondent Will Reeve.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Koblin covers the television industry.
