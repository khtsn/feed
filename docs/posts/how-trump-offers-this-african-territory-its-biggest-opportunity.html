A few miles away, dock workers unloaded cargo at a port on the Gulf of Aden, a vital global shipping route frequently under attack by Houthi rebels from Yemen.</p><p>These two maritime facilities in Berbera city belong to Somaliland, an enclave of about five million people that has functioned independently from Somalia since 1991. Some Somalilanders see the port and the airstrip as the keys to achieving a decades-old ambition: international recognition.</p><p>Somaliland has its own currency and passport, as well as control over its foreign and military affairs. It has held several widely praised independent elections. Now, it wants to make a deal with President Trump in which the United States would lease both the port and the airstrip in exchange for long-awaited statehood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Gaining an endorsement from the most powerful country in the world, Somalilanders say, would bring global investment and broader diplomatic and security ties.

The Trump administration is considering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/us-embassy-somalia-future-trump.html" title="">closing its embassy in Mogadishu</a>, the capital of Somalia, citing security risks. Persistent attacks from Houthis have disrupted international shipping, heightening concerns of growing instability in the region. And as the trade war with China heats up, a new U.S. foothold on the continent could help counter Chinese influence.</p><p>“Myself and my people are hopeful that the business-mindedness of President Trump will lead to the recognition of Somaliland,” President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi said last month in an interview with The New York Times at the presidential palace in Hargeisa, the capital. “This is the biggest opportunity we’ve had.”</p><p>Mr. Abdullahi plans to visit Washington in the coming months. The deal he envisions includes a U.S. military base along the territory’s 500-mile shoreline hugging the Gulf of Aden.

Days later, it merged with the Italian-administered Somalia to form the Somali Republic. Almost immediately, Somalilanders felt marginalized and neglected by the new government.</p><p>Then, in the 1980s, because of political marginalization and repression, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/13/world/over-300000-somalis-fleeing-civil-war-cross-into-ethiopia.html" title="">there was an open rebellion</a> against Mogadishu.

But the agreement set off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/world/africa/somalia-ethiopia-al-shabab-conflict.html" title="">a major diplomatic and military standoff</a> with Somalia, and raised concerns about a wider regional conflict that would pull in Ethiopia’s longtime adversaries, Eritrea and Egypt. After Turkish mediation, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed to end their dispute in December.</p><p>But the standoff had another effect: refocusing attention on Somaliland’s strategic assets, including its natural resources.</p><p>Orina Chang, a Taiwanese-American investor formerly with Morgan Stanley, recently worked with a mix of American and Somaliland geologists to map out locations for rare earth minerals across parts of Somaliland. Agencies, including the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, have shown interest in investing in the projects, she said.</p><p>“The U.S. government is now more interested in Somaliland than before,” she said. “All of a sudden, people are calling.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-27"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Last month in Hargeisa.
