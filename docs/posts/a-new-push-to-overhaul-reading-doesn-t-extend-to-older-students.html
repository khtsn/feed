They have thrown out old lesson plans, retrained teachers and bought new reading programs.</p><p>But the national movement to rethink reading has largely left out a generation of older students who are behind in literacy — and who will not recover without extra help.</p><p>In New York, where the Education Department is in the midst of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/nyregion/nyc-public-schools-reading.html" title="">high-stakes elementary reading overhaul</a>, the scale of the reading problems for these students is striking.</p><p>More than 60 percent of the city’s Black and Latino middle schoolers were not proficient in reading on this year’s state exams. In the Bronx, over 37 percent of middle-school boys scored in the bottom level, meaning they did not demonstrate even partial mastery of skills expected for their age.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the city’s lowest-income high schools, it is not uncommon for a quarter of incoming freshmen to test at or below a third-grade reading level.</p><p>And yet New York, like many districts around the country, has no comprehensive plan to tackle the issue.</p><p>“They’re always an afterthought,” said Susan Neuman, a former U.S. assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education. </p><p>The gaps in reading skills are an urgent problem with far-reaching consequences for the country’s work force and the well-being of today’s young people.</p><p>Already, 48 million adults in the U.S. are functionally illiterate, meaning they cannot read and write well enough to navigate common tasks. They may struggle to understand medical prescriptions, news articles and tax forms. Many are relegated to low-wage work or unemployment, and their children are at a greater risk for academic failure — creating a cycle of poverty. Poor readers <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/141324NCJRS.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are more likely to land in prison</a> or juvenile detention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>For many of them, the issues are likely to be a result of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/us/what-to-know-about-the-science-of-reading.html" title="">flawed early reading instruction</a> that schools are now trying to fix. Other students learn the basics, but fall off track later.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>School leaders acknowledge that many older students need help, but large districts like New York City have yet to tackle the problem with broad initiatives. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Blesener for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-713e0d29">From ‘learning to read’ to ‘reading to learn’</h2><p>Learning to read typically goes like this: Through third grade, children receive explicit lessons in the building blocks of literacy, like vocabulary and phonics. Then, strong students use those tools with more difficult texts in later grades, transitioning from “learning to read” to “reading to learn.”</p><p>If a child’s ability to decode words never reaches a certain level, it becomes extremely unlikely that their reading comprehension will advance, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fedu0000302" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent landmark study</a> found.</p><p>About 40 percent of children in America could fall below that level, said Rebecca Kockler, who leads Reading Reimagined, a program studying the issue with Stanford University researchers. She called the statistic “jaw dropping.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some students never received robust phonics instruction in elementary school. But even those who did may be able to break down a word like “cat,” while struggling with more complex ones like “education.”</p><p>It means that when improving reading instruction, more districts need a K-12 plan, not a K-3 plan, said Timothy Shanahan, a literacy expert and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois Chicago.</p><p>“Think of the millions they’ve spent on trying to improve the primary grade reading programs in the last 10 years in New York City,” Mr. Shanahan said. “That’s not a bad thing. But it’s not going to get what they really want.</p><p>“It really needs to be a system,” he said.</p><p>Nicole Brownstein, an Education Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that “for too long, many of our students fell through the cracks.” She said that 6,500 middle and high school students in New York were provided “evidence-based reading interventions” last year. The city is also reviewing curriculum options in older grades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tutors can provide intensive catch-up help.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Blesener for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>But there are not enough tutors to fill the need.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Blesener for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-1aea5cb1">Finding the time to practice</h2><p>For students who have fallen far behind, one of the biggest obstacles to catching up can be finding the time. Some groups use time-tested methods, like intensive tutoring — even on summer break — to help triage the problem.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In a bright yellow room filled with books in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, a handful of children spent an August afternoon behind desks. James, a sixth grader, practiced words like “heel,” as his volunteer tutor asked “what sound does ‘h’ make” and reminded him to “use a hard ‘e.’”</p><p>When Caleb, an eighth grader, encountered an unfamiliar word — “bona fide” — he scribbled it onto a notecard. His tutor explained, “it’s like ‘sincere’ or ‘legit.’”</p><p>The two have practiced reading skills for months at Read 718, a tutoring program for low-income children that offers the type of one-on-one attention that can help students make up lost ground.</p><p>The challenge is that “there’s just far too many kids who need additional support,” said Emily Kirven, the organization’s executive director. There is also the cost, at a time when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/schools-budget-cuts-pandemic-aid.html" title="">federal aid to help students recover</a> from pandemic losses is going away. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Over it all looms the dilemma of making room for reading in the school day — crammed with core classes, electives and state tests. Older students who are far behind would ideally spend about two hours per school day on literacy skills, some experts say, which means reading lessons often need to be part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/25/us/reading-literacy-memphis-tennessee.html" title="">science, social studies and even math class</a>.</p><p>Another issue is that middle and high school teachers are typically not trained to identify — or to help — struggling readers. They tend to be experts on content like European history or chemistry, and lack coaching on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/science-of-reading-literacy-parents.html?smid=tw-share" title="">brain science of how children learn</a>.</p><p>At Mott Hall Bronx High School, the lowest-performing readers receive explicit phonics lessons for about four hours a week from teachers who are reading experts. Gerard Mancusi, who helps lead small group interventions, said it has been a small but promising start.</p><p>Still, Mr. Mancusi added that when freshmen arrive years behind, it can feel like “an almost impossible problem” — one that can be “fixed,” but perhaps “not fully solved,” he said.</p><p>“The problem that always comes up is not the willingness of the teacher,” Mr. Mancusi said. “A lot of times, it comes down to resources.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Eric Adams has said he would not allow another student to struggle like he did with reading.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-6be8ddcb">‘My son is missing out’</h2><p>Students with learning disabilities represent a significant portion of struggling readers. Helping them has been a central issue for Mayor Eric Adams, who has dyslexia himself and was diagnosed late. </p><p>But more than halfway through his term, little has improved for middle and high schoolers with dyslexia, according to lawyers, families and advocates.</p><p>Alejandro, an 11-year-old in Brooklyn who reads at a second-grade level, is one of them.</p><p>His fourth-grade teacher wondered if he was dyslexic. But his school did not offer screening and told his mother to take him to the library more. Alejandro cried in the mornings, begging to stay home from school.</p><p>Now, in seventh grade and finally diagnosed with dyslexia, Alejandro and his lawyer won private tutoring to help him recover. But his school declined to add other support programs to his special education plan, and his mother worries about the damage done.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>“He’s so shut down from school,” his mother, Catherine Dipisa, said, adding that Alejandro doesn’t raise his hand in class “because he has no idea what’s going on.”</p><p>“My son is missing out on getting what he deserves, a proper education,” she said.</p><p>Students with dyslexia have trouble looking at the written word and blending the sounds into language. The city has rolled out universal <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2023/9/14/23872646/mayor-eric-adams-dyslexia-screening-nyc-schools-literacy-overhaul/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screening</a> to help <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/nyregion/adams-dyslexia-nyc-schools.html" title="">identify these children</a> in elementary grades, officials said. But few older students have been assessed.</p><p>Some schools also still use a <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2023/12/11/benchmark-assessment-system-reading-test-often-wrong" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">popular, but discredited reading test</a> that regularly fails to identify poor readers, leaving them unaware of how far behind a student may really be.</p><p>“Some of my clients struggle to read even sight words, and somehow they’ll have a fourth- or fifth-grade reading level,” said Calleigh Higgins, who works at the New York Legal Assistance Group.</p><p>Ms. Brownstein said the city has trained more than 500 intervention teachers and will expand dyslexia screening in juvenile justice and adult education centers “as we continue to invest in long-term upstream solutions.”</p><p>For now, many pupils are still waiting for help.</p><p>“There’s still a long, long, long way to go,” said Sarah Part, a senior policy analyst at Advocates for Children. “It makes sense that they started with early grades. But they can’t forget about older students. There’s just a huge amount of unmet need.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Troy Closson reports on K-12 schools in New York City for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/troy-closson">More about Troy Closson</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/new-york-city-department-of-education">New York City Department of Education</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/david-c-banks">David C.
