The utility adds renewable energy to the electric grid. A project’s subscribers get a discount on their utility bills, usually in the range of 5 to 20 percent.</p><p>In the past five years, the number of community solar projects in New York City and Westchester County, where Yorktown is, has mushroomed, to 700 from 72. About 78,000 households, a small but growing portion of the area served by Con Edison, the city’s utility company, now participate.</p><p>Across New York State, where community solar initiatives were first introduced about 10 years ago, the projects have grown to serve about 400,000 households, <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/91361.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a report</a> by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a research arm of the federal Energy Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/02/nyregion/02ny-solar-02-kmcl/00ny-solar-02-kmcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/02/nyregion/02ny-solar-02-kmcl/00ny-solar-02-kmcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/02/nyregion/02ny-solar-02-kmcl/00ny-solar-02-kmcl-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A large brick housing complex, with white terraces outside the apartment and a bare tree in the foreground." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/02/nyregion/02ny-solar-02-kmcl/00ny-solar-02-kmcl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/02/nyregion/02ny-solar-02-kmcl/00ny-solar-02-kmcl-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/02/nyregion/02ny-solar-02-kmcl/00ny-solar-02-kmcl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/02/nyregion/02ny-solar-02-kmcl/00ny-solar-02-kmcl-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/cf25cba0-be5e-5731-9905-3dd8363d505f" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A growing number of New Yorkers, including residents of Riverview Court Apartments in Yonkers, are taking advantage of community solar projects.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But even as community solar projects become more popular, they may be in jeopardy. President Trump<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/climate/trump-energy-fossil-fuels.html" title="">, on the first day of his second term,</a> moved to slow the advance of renewable energy. It is possible his administration could pressure Congress to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/business/energy-environment/trump-clean-energy-finance.html" title="">remove or amend federal tax credits</a> and other benefits that make installing solar panels more affordable. City and state officials, and solar developers, are preparing for an uncertain future.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“We don’t have a crystal ball,” said Louise Yeung, the chief climate officer for the New York City comptroller’s office, which is leading an effort to <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Public-Solar-NYC_PUBLIC.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increase access to affordable solar power</a> in the city. “We’re trying to do all of the administrative things that we can control on our end to make sure funding is secure.”</p><p>Pete Harckham, a Democratic state senator who represents parts of Westchester County and the Hudson Valley, is introducing several solar-related bills this year, including one that would <a href="https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2025/S2626" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">double state tax credits</a> for residential installations.</p><p>“The writing is on the wall,” Mr. Harckham said. “Under this president, the federal government is going to get out of clean energy incentives and it’s up to the states to lead.”</p><p>Across the country, community solar power has surged from just a few megawatts in 2015 to nearly 8,000 — enough, roughly, to power more than one million homes — by June 2024, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory report. Nearly three-quarters of the country’s 3,404 community solar projects so far are in four states: <a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/NY-Sun/Community-Solar" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York</a>, Florida, Massachusetts and Minnesota, the report said.</p><p>In a city like New York where most residents do not own their own homes or who live in co-op buildings with shared common areas, community solar projects are a practical way to reduce greenhouse emissions and lower energy bills, said Anika Wistar-Jones, a director at Solar One, a nonprofit organization focused on sustainability issues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Ben Pearcy, a projection designer for Broadway shows who lives in a Brooklyn co-op, has saved about $730 since enrolling in a community solar project two years ago. “I wish I could be generating solar power directly myself,” Mr. Pearcy, 53, said. “But since I can’t, this seemed like the next best thing.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“I wish I could be generating solar power directly myself,” said Ben Pearcy, a Brooklyn resident and subscriber to a community solar project. “But since I can’t, this seemed like the next best thing.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Some energy experts hope federal tax credits for solar power will remain intact considering that investment in renewable energy sources has given the U.S. economy a lift, particularly in congressional districts represented by Republicans.</p><p>“Forget the climate change aspect, if you want to meet the needs of the economy, you need to continue to develop renewables,” said Dan Giuffrida, the chief executive of Plankton Energy, a New York City solar developer.</p><p>But Mr. Trump has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/climate/wind-power-executive-order-trump.html" title="">halted federal permits for new wind farms</a>. And although he “doesn’t have the same antagonism to solar as he does to wind, Trump is a wild card,” Michael B. Gerrard, an environmental law professor at Columbia University, said. “There is no telling how far he’ll go to support fossil fuels, and so far Congress has been quite pliant.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Solar panels on the roof of an affordable housing property in Queens that is operated by Catholic Charities Brooklyn &amp; Queens.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Across New York City, community solar projects can be found on rooftops at Brooklyn shopping centers, universities in the Bronx and <a href="https://www.brightpower.com/nycha-announces-completion-of-solar-installations-at-queensbridge-houses/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public housing complexes in Queens</a>.

Those who participate will share ownership of the 45,000-square-foot installation with the developer.</p><p>“Revenue from the project will be reinvested into a community wealth fund,” said Elizabeth Yeampierre, the executive director of UPROSE, the nonprofit group that organized the joint venture.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Revenue from the project will be reinvested into a community wealth fund,” said Elizabeth Yeampierre, the leader of a community solar initiative in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park section.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>In addition to rooftops, community solar projects are sprouting up on plots throughout the region, including <a href="https://www.woodfieldrenewable.com/our-work" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">old industrial properties on Staten Island</a> and the former dairy farm in Yorktown.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>After the farm ceased dairy operations in the 1950s, the family that owned it began to slowly sell parcels. For a few decades, it was a bucolic family retreat until relatives died or moved away.</p><p>Leasing to a solar developer was a great use for the remaining 20 acres, said Kathryn Hoenig, a former lawyer whose family has owned the farm since 1840. “It’s a good economic and environmental solution to using the land in a thoughtful way as well as making money and keeping it in the family,” she said.</p><p>One of the project’s prominent subscribers is a high-end property in Downtown Brooklyn, <a href="https://505statestreet.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5i8BhDmARIsAGE4xHxDbo5HpQTaCCJtVZpL8pY5iochIEo6k7GqrUW4pZ6uSO3V3_P6M4QaAknzEALw_wcB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">505 State Street</a>, the city’s first all-electric residential tower.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>505 State Street, New York’s first all-electric residential tower, will get all of its power from community solar programs, including one from an old dairy farm in Yorktown, N.Y.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bing Guan for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Another core subscriber is an affordable housing property in Yonkers, where residents said they struggle to pay their energy bills.
