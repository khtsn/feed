    <h1>What the Polio Vaccine Has Meant for Public Health</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Salk vaccine was tested against a placebo in 1.8 million American first- and second-grade schoolchildren in a so-called double-blind placebo-controlled trial — the gold standard in American medicine, in which half the study subjects get an inert vaccine and doctors, parents and patients did not know who got which.</p><p>Salk himself objected to the use of a placebo during the clinical trial; he couldn’t imagine depriving a child of a lifesaving vaccine. As the petition before the F.D.A. notes, the current vaccine, manufactured by Sanofi, was not tested against a placebo; scientists and doctors almost universally agree that withholding a lifesaving vaccine would be unethical.</p><p>The Sanofi vaccine, given as a shot, is made using a technique similar to the one Salk used. It is an “inactivated” polio vaccine, meaning it is made using strains of inactivated, or killed, polio virus.</p><p>A different polio vaccine, first developed by the scientist Albert Sabin, a competitor to Salk, contained a live but weakened form of the polio virus. The Sabin vaccine, administered orally, replaced the Salk vaccine in 1962 and was in use for decades in the United States. But the oral vaccine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/07/us/doctors-urge-polio-shots-to-replace-oral-vaccine.html" title="">caused eight to 10 cases of paralytic polio</a> each year. In 1999, federal regulators decided to replace it with the current vaccine, which is safer.</p><p>The polio virus is still circulating worldwide. In 2022, an unvaccinated man in Rockland County, N.Y., was paralyzed by polio. Earlier this year, the virus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/health/polio-vaccine-gaza-children.html" title="">paralyzed a child in Gaza,</a> the first case in the region in 25 years, which prompted a mass vaccination campaign against polio.</p></div></div>
