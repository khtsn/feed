Pots clanged, horns honked and factory whistles blew around the country.</p><p>In the seven decades since, polio — a disease that <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once killed or paralyzed</a> more than half a million people around the world each year — has been vanquished in the United States.</p><p>A lawyer advising Robert F. Kennedy Jr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" title="">has asked t</a>he Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the current polio vaccine, a successor to the Salk vaccine, because it has not been tested against a placebo.</p><p>Experts say the move would be disastrous, because the polio virus is still around.</p><p>“We would have big outbreaks of polio,” warned Dr. Walter Orenstein, who ran immunization programs for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the late 1980s and 1990s. Because some people infected with polio are asymptomatic, Dr. Orenstein said, the virus could spread through the population unnoticed — until people started getting paralyzed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Salk vaccine was tested against a placebo in 1.8 million American first- and second-grade schoolchildren in a so-called double-blind placebo-controlled trial — the gold standard in American medicine, in which half the study subjects get an inert vaccine and doctors, parents and patients did not know who got which.</p><p>Salk himself objected to the use of a placebo during the clinical trial; he couldn’t imagine depriving a child of a lifesaving vaccine. As the petition before the F.D.A. notes, the current vaccine, manufactured by Sanofi, was not tested against a placebo; scientists and doctors almost universally agree that withholding a lifesaving vaccine would be unethical.</p><p>The Sanofi vaccine, given as a shot, is made using a technique similar to the one Salk used. It is an “inactivated” polio vaccine, meaning it is made using strains of inactivated, or killed, polio virus.</p><p>A different polio vaccine, first developed by the scientist Albert Sabin, a competitor to Salk, contained a live but weakened form of the polio virus. The Sabin vaccine, administered orally, replaced the Salk vaccine in 1962 and was in use for decades in the United States. But the oral vaccine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/07/us/doctors-urge-polio-shots-to-replace-oral-vaccine.html" title="">caused eight to 10 cases of paralytic polio</a> each year. In 1999, federal regulators decided to replace it with the current vaccine, which is safer.</p><p>The polio virus is still circulating worldwide. In 2022, an unvaccinated man in Rockland County, N.Y., was paralyzed by polio. Earlier this year, the virus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/health/polio-vaccine-gaza-children.html" title="">paralyzed a child in Gaza,</a> the first case in the region in 25 years, which prompted a mass vaccination campaign against polio.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“We still need to give the polio vaccine as long as these strains are in the environment,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. If the vaccine is eliminated, Dr. Offit said, “these strains will do just what they did in Gaza and do just what they did to this man in Rockland County.”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sheryl Gay Stolberg covers health policy for The Times from Washington.
