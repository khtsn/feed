    <h1>How Art Stars Are Made</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Museums provide the first draft of art history. They decide which artists get to share wall space with masters like Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Picasso.</p><p>Choosing which artists to exhibit requires museums to consider ultrasubjective questions about, say, the artistic merit of a painting or the historical relevance of a sculpture. The task has traditionally fallen to curators, who maintain their scholarly independence and grapple with the complexities of mounting shows.</p><p>But in recent years, museums have increasingly turned to another source for logistical and, at times, financial support for their shows: major commercial art galleries.</p><p>The scale of these partnerships was largely unexamined until now. This morning, The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/arts/design/hauser-and-wirth-nyc-museum-shows.html" title="">published an analysis</a> by my colleague Julia Halperin and me of more than 350 solo exhibitions by contemporary artists in New York’s biggest art museums over the last six years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>We found that nearly a quarter of those exhibitions featured artists who were represented by just 11 major galleries. These were no ordinary mom-and-pop dealerships but “mega-galleries,” as professionals call them — an elite slice of the art world that accounts for a sizable chunk of the $57.5 billion art market.</p><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain how the increasingly close relationship between museums and commercial galleries is shaping whose work is shown to the public.</p><h2 id="link-4400a35f">Painting by numbers</h2><p>Mega-galleries emerged as a phenomenon of the ascendant market for contemporary art in the early 2000s, when wealthy collectors became less interested in buying up old masters and more interested in cozying up to living artists like Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. Some dealerships rapidly expanded as a result. The best known today is owned by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/arts/design/larry-gagosian-gallery-art-succession.html" title="">Larry Gagosian</a>, whose global network of galleries represents more than 100 artists and estates.</p><p>Museums have typically downplayed their relationships with mega-galleries. But as traditional corporate sponsors pull back and attendance has yet to rebound from the pandemic, they are increasingly turning to galleries for support.</p><p>Some experts said that the overlap between mega-galleries and major museums was to be expected, considering both groups are eager to spotlight the field’s most influential figures. But others warn that such collaborations can raise questions of a conflict of interest, since museum shows typically lift the reputations of artists and the prices that their works command — which can help their gallerists profit handsomely.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3e83e310">A New No. 1</h2><p>The spring season offers a particularly stark example of how a single gallery can dominate New York’s major museums.</p><p>Four of the city’s most prestigious museums are mounting exhibits showcasing artists who are represented by a single gallery: Hauser &amp; Wirth, a Swiss juggernaut with 19 locations around the world, including three in Manhattan.</p><p>Their artists are now being shown at some of the buzziest exhibits of the season:</p><ul><li><p>the Whitney Museum of American Art’s survey of works by Amy Sherald, the painter behind Michelle Obama’s official portrait</p></li><li><p>the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum’s Rashid Johnson show</p></li><li><p>the Museum of Modern Art’s Jack Whitten retrospective</p></li><li><p>and the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s upcoming Lorna Simpson show.</p></li></ul><p>Some in New York’s art world have taken to calling this “Hauser spring.”</p><p>The gallery has provided logistical support to most of those shows and financial support to some — only the Museum of Modern Art said it had a policy of not accepting funding from art galleries. Gallery officials said that museum support was a key part of their long-term strategy to promote artists.</p><p>That strategy has clearly been successful. Our analysis found that Hauser &amp; Wirth is now the most influential gallery in New York’s museum scene, despite the fact that most Americans would be unable to identify its founders, Iwan and Manuela Wirth, from a lineup.</p><p>Marc Payot, the gallery’s president, struck a humble tone when I asked him about the development. “It is way less about our influence but really a testament to the artists,” he said, explaining that the artists had their own relationships with each of the museums. “It’s easy to be cynical, but it’s sincere.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-a94b887">Pope Francis’ Funeral</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Pope Francis’ funeral, which took place on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/world/europe/pope-francis-funeral-vatican-catholic-church.html" title="">solemn and majestic</a>, Jason Horowitz writes.

But if you want to know what the pontiff made of his own life, look no further than his best-selling memoir, which came out in January. The book opens with the story of his grandparents’ emigration from Italy to Argentina in 1929, a legacy of struggle and tenacity that imprinted itself upon Francis until the end of his life. “I too could have been among the outcasts of today,” he writes, “so that one question is always lodged in my heart: Why them and not me?” He weighs in on war, environmental crisis, social policy, technology and the future of the church with humility and candor. </p><h2 id="link-60b5e8f7">More on books</h2><ul><li><p>In “More Everything Forever,” Adam Becker scrutinizes Silicon Valley’s “ideology of technical salvation.” Read our review <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/books/review/more-everything-forever-adam-becker.html" title="">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-5eb0e2f"><span><strong>BELIEVING</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Iris Legendre</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lauren-jackson"><img alt="Lauren Jackson" title="Lauren Jackson" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/19/reader-center/author-lauren-jackson/author-lauren-jackson-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></a></p></div></div></div><p>A passage from a book has lingered with me for a decade. In the National Book Award winning “Let the Great World Spin,” Colum McCann writes of a character named Corrigan who wants “a fully believable God, one you could find in the grime of the everyday.”</p><p>I’ve always wondered whether that was something McCann wanted himself.

He wrote an essay in response. It’s about biking across America, searching for a faith. In the essay, “The Church of the Open Road,” he writes of a “quarrel with God under the bullet-holed stars.” He also describes what he found in the dust and grime of his own journey.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/style/colum-mccann-biking-church.html" title="">Read the essay here</a>.</p><p><strong><em>For more:</em></strong><em> </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/believing" title=""><em>Sign up to receive the latest installments</em></a><em> of “Believing” in your inbox.</em></p><h3 id="link-420eedc"><span><strong>THE INTERVIEW</strong></span></h3></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Devin Oktar Yalkin for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><em>This week’s subject for The Interview is the writer Isabel Allende, whose new book, “My Name Is Emilia del Valle,” will be published on May 6.

So you think: Well, I can live with this. Well, it can’t be that bad. So you are in denial for a long time, because you don’t want things to change so much. And then one day it hits you personally. For me, it was several things. At the beginning, I was hiding people in my house, because we didn’t know the consequences. We had no idea that if that person was arrested and forced to say where they had been, I would be arrested. Maybe my children would be tortured in front of me.</p><p>But you learn that later. By the time I was directly threatened, I said, OK, I’m leaving. And my idea was that I was going to leave for a couple of months and then come back. So I went alone to Venezuela. And then a month later, my husband realized that I shouldn’t go back. And so he left. He just closed the door, locked the entrance door of the house with everything it contained and left to reunite with me in Venezuela.
