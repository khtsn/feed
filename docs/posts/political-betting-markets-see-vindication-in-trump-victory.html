By the time polls closed, the chances of a Trump victory shot up.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prediction markets started reflecting a likely Trump win several weeks ago, even as opinion polls showed the race was neck and neck. That was despite questions about potential manipulation, notably with the emergence of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/business/dealbook/polymarket-trump-trader.html" title="">French trader</a> who for a time cornered the market for the pro-Trump contract on Polymarket.</p><p>“Polls 0,” <a href="https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1854067413643301021" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tarek Mansour</a>, the chief executive of Kalshi, wrote on X. “Prediction markets 1.”</p><p>Others have sought to get in on the action. <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/general/about/mediaRelations/10-4-24.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Interactive Brokers</a> and <a href="https://go.robinhood.com/election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robinhood</a> set up their own political betting markets over the past month. And Wall Street is increasingly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-30/polymarket-s-influence-on-wall-street-s-game-plan-grows-despite-red-flags" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">incorporating results</a> from these platforms into its research.</p><p>Investor interest in the business is growing as well, with Polymarket working to close a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/technology/polymarket-election-betting-crypto-trump.html" title="">$50 million fund-raising</a> round that would value the company at $300 million. (It is already backed by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.)</p><p>Prediction markets could become even bigger in future elections.
