Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-qatar.html" title="">effusively praised</a> Mr. Trump, who in turn called his host a “great gentleman” and a “friend of mine.”</p><p>Neither leader mentioned it, but Mr. Trump plans to accept <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/us/politics/trump-qatar-jet-gift-air-force-one.html" title="">a luxury Boeing 747-8</a> as a donation from Qatar’s royal family to serve as Air Force One. There has been backlash from Democrats and even some of Mr. Trump’s supporters to the proposal, which raises extensive legal and ethical issues. The president has said he would be “stupid” not to accept the plane.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The U.S. military has been using Al Udeid since September 2001, when it positioned planes there to target the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Two years later, Al Udeid became the main U.S. air operations hub in the region.</p><p>U.S. commanders used Al Udeid to coordinate a wide variety of missions during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as strikes against ISIS in Syria. The Air Force has deployed a wide variety of aircraft there, from advanced fighters and long-range bombers to drones, transport planes and in-flight refueling tankers.</p><p>The Combined Air Operations Center at the base helps project U.S. air power across <a href="https://www.afcent.af.mil/About/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/217803/combined-air-operations-center-caoc/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a vast region encompassing 21 countries</a>, from Northeast Africa to Central and South Asia, according to the Air Force.</p><p>Qatar, which saw the United States as its main protector in the Middle East, finished building the base in 1996, hoping to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/28/world/aftereffects-bases-us-will-move-air-operations-to-qatar-base.html" title="">encourage the deployment of the U.S. military</a> there.</p><p>Over the years, Qatar has spent more than $8 billion to develop the base, which its military also uses alongside the British Royal Air Force, as part of Qatar’s efforts to build up its partnership with the United States. The statement of defense cooperation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/qatar-airways-boeing-jets.html" title="">signed between Qatar and the United States on Wednesday</a> included $38 billion in potential investments, including support for burden-sharing at the base.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In a nod to the partnership, Qatari and American flags flanked the stage set up for Mr. Trump at Al Udeid on Thursday. An American Reaper drone was displayed on one side of the stage, and a Qatari F-15 fighter jet on the other.</p><p>The modernization and expansion of the base has allowed a number of <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-qatar" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">key U.S. military commands</a> to operate out of it. Along with the U.S. Central Command, the base also hosts command facilities for special forces.</p><p>The base has played a role outside of offensive military operations too. In 2021, as the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan, Al Udeid became <a href="https://statemag.state.gov/2021/11/1121feat01-d/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the central evacuation point</a> for tens of thousands of people leaving that country, including Americans and Afghans considered at risk from the Taliban.</p><p>The base’s location was carefully guarded until 2013, when Chuck Hagel, then the defense secretary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/world/middleeast/hagel-lifts-veil-on-major-military-center-in-qatar.html" title="">lifted the veil of secrecy</a>.</p><p>Landing later on Thursday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump toured the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, one of the largest in the world. He was accompanied by Sheikh Khaled bin Mohammed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Luke Broadwater<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
