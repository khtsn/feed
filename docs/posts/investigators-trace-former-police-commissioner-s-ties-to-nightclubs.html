Caban, and his brother James Caban dating back to Jan. 1, 2018, according to the person.</p><p>Investigators are looking for evidence that would support bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges, said the person, who, lacking authorization to discuss the case publicly, asked to speak anonymously. No one in the Police Department has been arrested or charged.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The person’s account gave a fuller picture of what investigators have been seeking as they have fanned out through the city, issuing search warrants and subpoenas to members of Mayor Eric Adams’s administration, which has been engulfed in at least four federal inquiries that have already led to several resignations.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Edward Caban, 57, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/nyregion/edward-caban-resigns-nypd-commissioner.html" title="">was the first to resign on Sept. 12</a>, at the request of City Hall, which had asked him to step aside after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-sheena-fbi-search-nyc.html" title="">federal agents seized his phone</a> on Sept. 4 as part of a criminal investigation.</p><p>Mr. Caban, whose departure ended a career that spanned more than 30 years at the Police Department, said he was leaving because “the noise around recent developments” had made it impossible for him to lead the agency.</p><p>His lawyers have said he is not the investigation’s target.</p><p>“He expects to cooperate fully with the government,” his lawyers, Russell Capone and Rebekah Donaleski, said Wednesday.</p><p>Sean Hecker and David Patton, lawyers for James Caban, a former police officer who was fired from the department more than two decades ago, said that he<strong> </strong>“unequivocally denies any wrongdoing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Caban was fired after he detained and threatened a livery cabdriver whom he had accused of stealing money from his wife’s purse.</p><p>His lawyers described him as a consultant who serves as a liaison with the department and works for a private company that they did not name. The work, Mr. Hecker and Mr. Patton said, “is perfectly legal, especially given his previous career as a N.Y.P.D. officer.”</p><p>Federal agents from the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York and the Internal Revenue Service are conducting the investigation. Agents seized the phones of both Caban twins, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>The police declined to comment. “Any questions regarding the investigation should be directed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” the department said in an email.</p><p>A spokesman for that office declined to comment. The I.R.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Police Department officials have said that federal investigators asked for the phones of several officers.</p><p>At least three — two lieutenants and a detective — have been contacted by federal agents, according to the person with knowledge of the investigation.</p><p>One lieutenant was served a subpoena by the I.R.S. to testify before a grand jury, the person said. The other lieutenant and the detective, who worked in the commissioner’s office, had their phones seized, the person said. Other department officials whose phones were seized include Mr. Caban’s chief of staff and two Queens precinct commanders, two other people with knowledge of the matter have said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>James Caban, the former commissioner’s twin, had a police security detail decades after being fired from the force.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The detective contacted by federal agents is assigned to security details, said Scott Munro, the president of the police detectives’ union. The detective “is just a potential witness in whatever they’re looking into,” he said. “We’re confident our member has done nothing wrong.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Hecker and Mr. Patton said that James Caban had a police security detail.</p><p>“The N.Y.P.D. protection provided to Mr. Caban was solely for his safety given his close relationship with his identical twin brother, Commissioner Caban, who faces numerous threats to his security given his position,” Mr. Hecker and Mr. Patton said in a statement. “Our client has fully cooperated with law enforcement and, once their investigation is complete, it will be clear that these claims are unfounded.”</p><p>The investigators are examining a wide range of information. According to the person with knowledge of the inquiry, they are seeking:</p><ul><li><p>Records or evidence of payments from nightclubs, bars or restaurants to James Caban or to any members of law enforcement.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Evidence of any actions taken by members of law enforcement at the request of any nightclub, bar or restaurant.</p></li><li><p>Records of promotions or transfers of members of law enforcement.</p></li><li><p>Officers’ testimony surrounding the department’s rules and regulations around conflicts of interest and accepting gifts, services or money.</p></li></ul><p>The two lieutenants who were contacted by federal officials work in special operations units of the department that are charged with responding to nightclubs, restaurants and bars that have chronic complaints against them.</p><p>None of the three officers are targets of the investigation, according to the person.</p><p>Chelsia Rose Marcius<!-- --> and <!-- -->Michael Wilson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maria Cramer is a Times reporter covering the New York Police Department and crime in the city and surrounding areas.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-cramer">More about Maria Cramer</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>23</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Former Police Commissioner’s Ties to Nightclubs Are Said to be Sought<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
