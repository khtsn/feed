And the words written on the bullets he used to kill a man in cold blood on a sidewalk on Wednesday have become, for some people, a rallying cry.</p><p>Three days after a gunman assassinated a top health insurance executive in Midtown Manhattan and vanished, the unidentified suspect has, in some quarters, been venerated as something approaching a folk hero.</p><p>The authorities have pleaded for help from the public to find the person who killed the UnitedHealthcare executive, Brian Thompson, who was a husband and father of two children. But in a macabre turn, some people seem to be more interested in rooting for the gunman and thwarting the police’s efforts.</p><p>The Upper West Side hostel where officials believe the unknown man stayed during his time in the city has reportedly received a deluge of bad reviews online, with some people <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/hostel-where-suspect-in-unitedhealthcare-ceo-slaying-stayed-flooded-with-reviews-with-some-calling-them-narcs-for-cooperating/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling the workers there “narcs.”</a> The business has been cooperating with the police.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Police officers searched Central Park on Friday for clues to the suspect’s whereabouts. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/nyregion/ceo-brian-thompson-gunman-video.html" title="">The shooter left a trail of evidence</a> for the police to track: a distinctive backpack abandoned in Central Park; a water bottle with DNA found at the crime scene; and a collage of surveillance video of him throughout the city, including a photo of him with his mask down at the hostel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the clue that has ignited the most chatter online, and that appears to have garnered the gunman a following, are the words officials say they found scribbled in permanent marker on bullet casings discovered at the scene: “depose,” “deny” and “delay.” Although the words could have multiple meanings, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/nyregion/delay-deny-defend-united-health-care-insurance-claims.html" title="">they may be a reference to the tactics used by insurers</a> of all kinds to avoid paying claims.</p><p>In some circles, those words alone have been enough for people to openly root for the shooter and hope that he escapes the grasp of law enforcement.</p><p>Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser at the Network Contagion Research Institute, which tracks online threats, said the internet rhetoric had left experts “pretty disturbed” by the glorification of the murder of Brian Thompson and the “lionization of the shooter.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://networkcontagion.us/reports/praise-for-united-healthcare-ceo-assassination-goes-viral/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report this week</a>, the institute found that of the top 10 most-engaged posts on X about the shooting on Wednesday, six “either expressed explicit or implicit support for the killing or denigrated the victim.” The dynamic is similar to the discourse that often emerges after a mass shooting on websites like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/technology/ai-4chan-online-harassment.html" title="">4chan and 8chan</a>, where perpetrators of extreme violence become memes themselves, Mr. Goldenberg said, “but what’s disturbing about this is it’s mainstream.”</p><p>“It’s being framed as some opening blow in a broader class war, which is very concerning as it heightens the threat environment for similar actors to engage in similar acts of violence,” Mr. Goldenberg said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>On Saturday afternoon, about half a dozen men gathered in the December cold at Washington Square Park in Lower Manhattan to participate in a look-alike contest for the gunman.
