He then made a 19-minute case against Donald Trump, asking his viewers to send the clip to “a Republican you love and respect.” </p><p>“Ask them to watch this whole thing as a personal favor to you,” he said. Then, after promising no “liberal virtue-signaling” and throwing in a Biden joke, he introduced himself to “those of you who don’t ever watch.”</p><blockquote><p>“I’m Jimmy Kimmel. Maybe you remember me from ‘The Man Show.’ We had a pretty good relationship back then — the beer, the trampolines. Good times, right? We had fun. But now times are less fun.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“We are very divided, and not just because of Donald Trump, because of people like, if I’m being honest, me. I do a lot of mocking and belittling, and it isn’t always productive.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="YouTubeEmbedBlock-1"><figure><p data-testid="youtubeEmbedBlock"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oy0zq8YzY9w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><blockquote><p>“Am I biased against Donald Trump? Yes. Do I think I have good reasons for being biased against him? Yes. And I’m probably wrong, but I think when you hear some of those reasons, you might agree with me, even just a little bit.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Maybe there’s a little voice in the back your head saying, ‘I might not want this guy driving the bus.’ And if you’re one of those people who think Democrats are controlling the weather or Beyoncé eats baby skin, forget it. This is not going to help at all.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Donald Trump is the exact meeting point between QAnon and QVC. You remember when Ronald Reagan was selling high-tops in the 1980s? No, you don’t, because he wasn’t.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Not to mention the 34 felony convictions. Will he be president from jail? I mean, how do you see that working?” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Anyway, if you made it this far, thank you for listening.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-16cadea1">The Punchiest Punchlines (What a Joke Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“It’s rare to tell a joke so bad that it alters the course of human history.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT, on the backlash over the comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally who compared Puerto Rico to garbage</em></p><p>“Today, following his disastrous rally at Madison Square Garden, former President Trump defended the event and called it an ‘absolute lovefest.’ Then Kamala Harris looked at the polls and said, ‘Well, I’m certainly loving it.’” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“It reminds me of the Shakespeare sonnet, ‘Shall I compare thee to a floating pile of garbage?’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“This joke looks like it could have a lasting effect on the race, and I get why Puerto Ricans are upset. But it’s still crazy to me that a joke from Trump’s warm-up guy seems to be having more of an impact than Trump’s actual terrible record on Puerto Rico. I mean, his administration blocked Puerto Rico from receiving hurricane relief, then Trump went down there and tossed paper towels into the crowd, I guess to help them soak up the hurricane?” <em>— RONNY CHIENG</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Tom Hanks played a mad scientist seeking revenge on an old friend, played by Stephen Colbert, in a spooky segment of “Too Much Exposition Theatre” on Tuesday’s “Late Show.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-1f978490">What We’re Excited About on Wednesday Night</h2><p>The all-girl rock band The Linda Lindas will be Ronny Chieng’s guests on Wednesday’s “Daily Show.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Nora Ephron’s work is once again on the upswing, reaffirming her as a cultural touchstone.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Warner Bros., via Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
