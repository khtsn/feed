But they will lead to direct out-of-pocket savings for only a subset of the millions of older Americans who take the drugs subject to negotiations.</p><p>Other provisions of the law that created the drug negotiation program, such as capping patients’ expenses for insulin and their yearly out-of-pocket drug costs, will do more to save older Americans money at the pharmacy counter.</p><p>The 10 drugs subject to negotiations include widely used blood thinners and arthritis medications. Had the new prices been in effect last year, Medicare would have saved $6 billion, which would have reduced its spending by 22 percent, administration officials said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“It’s a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn’s disease and more,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “And it’s a relief for American taxpayers.”</p><p>This is the first time that the federal government has directly negotiated with drugmakers on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, a reshaping of its role in a program that covers tens of millions of older and disabled Americans.</p><p>Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris are set to speak on Thursday afternoon at an event in Maryland celebrating the Medicare announcement, a sign of the issue’s importance to Mr. Biden’s legacy and Ms. Harris’s presidential hopes.</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry, which has fiercely opposed the negotiation program, quickly criticized the new prices on Thursday. Bristol Myers Squibb, the maker of the blood thinner Eliquis, one of the drugs subject to negotiations, <a href="https://www.bms.com/inflation-reduction-act-mfp-for-eliquis.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the drug’s new price “does not reflect the substantial clinical and economic value of this essential medicine.”</p><p>It is impossible to tell how much the new prices will save Medicare for each individual drug. The federal government does not disclose the net prices it pays for medications, which take into account the billions of dollars in discounts that reduce Medicare’s spending.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But <a href="https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2024.24153" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> from health economists who have analyzed Medicare’s actual spending indicate that many of the new prices are lower than what the government has paid in recent years, with some drugs more discounted than others.</p><p>“These are impressive results,” said Jack Hoadley, a Medicare expert and research professor emeritus at Georgetown University.</p><p>Wall Street analysts, however, told investors they thought the drug companies made out relatively unscathed, with discounts not much greater than what they already concede. “Sigh of relief,” analysts at the investment bank Leerink Partners wrote to investors. None of the big companies whose drugs were subject to negotiation had major swings in their stock prices on Thursday.</p><hr/><h3 id="link-58a5fc71"><span>2026 Prices for Drugs Subject to Negotiations</span></h3><p><em>Prices are the maximum Medicare Part D plans and the patient will pay for a one-month supply.</em></p><p>1. <strong>Eliquis</strong>, for preventing strokes and blood clots, from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, $231</p><p>2. <strong>Jardiance</strong>, for diabetes and heart failure, from Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly, $197</p><p>3. <strong>Xarelto</strong>,<strong> </strong>for preventing strokes and blood clots, from Johnson &amp; Johnson, $197</p><p>4. <strong>Januvia</strong>, for diabetes, from Merck, $113</p><p>5. <strong>Farxiga</strong>, for diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease, from AstraZeneca $178</p><p>6. <strong>Entresto</strong>, for heart failure, from Novartis, $295</p><p>7. <strong>Enbrel</strong>, for autoimmune conditions, from Amgen, $2,355</p><p>8. <strong>Imbruvica</strong>, for blood cancers, from AbbVie and Johnson &amp; Johnson, $9,319</p><p>9. <strong>Stelara</strong>, for autoimmune conditions, from Johnson &amp; Johnson, $4,695</p><p>10. <strong>Fiasp </strong>and<strong> NovoLog </strong>insulin products, for diabetes, from Novo Nordisk, $119</p></div></div><div><div><hr/><p>Medicare’s Part D program covers most of the costs of prescription drugs that seniors take at home. Approximately <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/fact-sheet-negotiated-prices-initial-price-applicability-year-2026.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nine million</a> Part D beneficiaries took at least one of the first 10 medications subject to negotiations in 2023.</p><p>The new prices were made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act, a climate, health and tax bill Mr. Biden signed in 2022 that authorized the health and human services secretary to negotiate on behalf of Medicare.</p><p>The legislation delivered more immediate benefits to Medicare beneficiaries, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/04/us/politics/biden-insulin-voters-drugs.html" title="">a $35 monthly cap</a> on out-of-pocket costs for insulin, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/us/politics/prescription-drugs-medicare-health-bill.html" title="">$2,000 annual cap on patient costs</a> for drugs taken at home. The $2,000 limit will go into effect next year.</p><p>The seniors who may see direct savings from the negotiation provision of the law are those whose insurance requires them to pay a percentage, often 25 percent, of a drug’s cost before discounts. When Medicare’s price is lowered in 2026, their out-of-pocket costs may be lowered too, by as much as hundreds of dollars — though that will make little difference for some, because they will already be benefiting from the $2,000 limit on yearly costs.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The White House on Thursday <a href="https://x.com/POTUS/status/1824053427317465545" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a video</a> of a conversation Mr. Biden held with Judy Aiken, a retired nurse who has arthritis and could benefit substantially from the Medicare negotiations. Seated at a table outside the Oval Office, she told Mr. Biden she spent about $9,000 out of pocket on Enbrel last year, and has sometimes skipped doses because of the cost.</p><p>Under her current Medicare plan, which requires her to shoulder a percentage of Enbrel’s cost, Ms. Aiken must pay $2,200 out of pocket for her first refill of the year. In 2026, when Enbrel’s new Medicare price goes into effect, that first refill of the year would cost Ms. Aiken $730.</p><p>Xavier Becerra, the health and human services secretary, said he hopes Americans would recognize the savings that would come from the program beyond what some Medicare beneficiaries might save at the pharmacy counter.</p><p>“I hope what they see is that there is money to be saved by negotiating,” he said.</p><p>The prices released Thursday represent the maximum that Medicare Part D plans and the patient will pay for a one-month supply. Medicare shoulders most of the cost and the patient typically covers a portion.</p><p>The selected drugs <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/fact-sheet-medicare-selected-drug-negotiation-list-ipay-2026.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account for some of the highest Medicare spending</a>, have been on the market for years and do not face competition.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The number of drugs negotiated by the federal government is set to increase in the coming years. Mr. Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called for</a> Medicare to negotiate the prices of 500 drugs over the next decade.</p><p>Ms. Harris has focused some of her early presidential campaign on the Biden administration’s drug pricing reforms, including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Yr4U5Clls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cap on monthly insulin costs</a> for Medicare recipients. At a series of campaign events last week, Ms. Harris <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/07/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-governor-walz-at-a-campaign-event/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said that</a> efforts to “take on Big Pharma” would be among her first priorities as president.</p><p>Ms. Harris cast the tiebreaking vote for the legislation that delivered the drug price negotiation program.</p><p>The new prices could be especially important in appeals to older voters, who make up roughly 90 percent of the more than 60 million Medicare recipients and represent a potentially decisive group in an election with slim vote margins.</p><p>Still, only around half of Americans 65 and older surveyed in late April and early May were aware of the drug price negotiation program, <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/press-release/new-kff-poll-finds-that-many-older-voters-are-unaware-of-medicare-drug-price-negotiation-but-awareness-has-grown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> KFF, the nonprofit health policy research group that carried out the survey.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Negotiations over drug prices are not new for Medicare.</p><p>Medicare’s Part D program covers most of the costs of prescription drugs that seniors take at home. It relies on hundreds of plans run by private insurers that administer the program. Part D plans hire middlemen known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/21/business/prescription-drug-costs-pbm.html" title="">pharmacy benefit managers</a>, or P.B.M.s, to negotiate with manufacturers to secure lower prices for the government, by extracting discounts off an initial sticker price.</p><p>The result is that Medicare, like employers in the private market, already pays less than the sticker prices for the medications subject to negotiation.</p><p>But the new negotiation program goes further in creating more leverage for Medicare by empowering the government to negotiate prices directly with manufacturers on behalf of all beneficiaries.</p><p>The negotiations have faced a legal onslaught from the drugmakers, who have argued that the program is unconstitutional and will stifle innovation and harm patients by discouraging the development of new drugs.</p><p>The lawsuits, most of which are still moving through the courts, have <a href="https://litigationtracker.law.georgetown.edu/issues/inflation-reduction-act/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had little success so far</a>. </p><p>Stephen J. Ubl, the chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry’s main lobbying group, said in a statement that the negotiation program amounted to a “price-setting scheme to drive political headlines.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>The pharmaceutical industry fears that the Medicare negotiation program will lead to lower prices in the private market. With Medicare’s lower prices now public, P.B.M.s negotiating on behalf of the privately insured will have greater leverage to demand deeper discounts from manufacturers.</p><p>Medicare’s new influence on drug prices could be weakened or reversed if former President Donald J. Trump wins the White House in November, particularly with full Republican control of Congress. The authors of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation-sponsored playbook for a future Republican administration written in part by former Trump administration officials, <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued that</a> the drug price negotiation program should be repealed.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Noah Weiland writes about health care for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/noah-weiland">More about Noah Weiland</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Rebecca Robbins is a reporter covering the pharmaceutical industry.
