The company first teased them more than a decade ago, when Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-unveils-futuristic-plan-delivery-by-drone/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">went on “60 Minutes”</a> to declare the start of Prime Air, an experimental drone delivery service that the company hoped would one day deliver millions of packages to customers in 30 minutes or less.</p><p>For Amazon addicts, the pitch was irresistible. Need a phone charger? Forgot your toothpaste on a work trip? Tap a button, Mr. Bezos said, and an autonomous drone would zoom through the sky to deliver it to you, in less time than it would take you to drive to the store.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>That future didn’t arrive on schedule, however, and Mr. Bezos is now more focused on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/technology/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-elon-musk.html" title="">sending rockets to space</a>. But Amazon hasn’t given up on drones. This week, I was invited along with my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/podcasts/hardfork-amazon-drone-delivery.html" title="">“Hard Fork”</a> co-host, Casey Newton, to tour the facility where Amazon just launched the newest iteration of Prime Air, and see its new drones in action.</p><p>Our tour was awkwardly timed — smack-dab in the middle of a national panic over the drones hovering over New Jersey. (For what it’s worth, Amazon officials say the mystery drones aren’t theirs. Federal officials said this week that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/politics/drone-sightings-explanations.html" title="">most of the reported sightings</a> had turned out to be piloted planes and hobby drones, although some remain unexplained.)</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
