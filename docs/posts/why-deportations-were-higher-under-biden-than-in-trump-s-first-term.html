Mr. Biden continued the practice until the end of the public health emergency in May 2023.</p><p>Title 42 expulsions made up a vast majority of removals during the pandemic years, but their totals can be misleading. Because these expulsions carried fewer penalties than a formal removal order, many people who were expelled simply attempted to cross again. (Those who were caught could be <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/title-42-autopsy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expelled repeatedly</a> — the proportion of people who were arrested by Border Patrol again within a year rose to <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly 30 percent in 2021</a>.)</p><p>During the pandemic, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported fewer people from the interior of the country.
