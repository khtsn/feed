The haul is the largest seizure of counterfeit musical instruments on record, officials said in announcing the bust on Tuesday.</p><p>“These fraudulent guitars may look and feel legitimate for unsuspecting consumers buying them from third-party online sources, street markets, unauthorized retailers, and person-to-person transactions,” said Cheryl M. Davies, the director of field operations for Customs and Border Protection in Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The biggest tip-off, though, might have been that authentic Gibson guitars are made only in Nashville and Bozeman, Mont.</p><p>“This is really emotional and personal for us,” Beth Heidt, chief marketing officer at Gibson, said at a news conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday. She said that generations of American families “have dedicated their entire lives to hand-crafting Gibson instruments.”</p><p>The company was founded in 1894 and its headquarters are in Nashville. Gibson’s best-selling guitars <a href="https://www.gibson.com/en-US/Collection/electric-best-sellers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost</a> about $2,000, but that can quickly rise to five figures for <a href="https://www.gibson.com/en-US/Collection/artist" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signature models</a> created with popular guitarists. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/nyregion/a-les-paul-six-string-brings-in-six-figures-at-auction.html" title="">Vintage guitars</a> have been sold for the low six figures.</p><p>That makes Gibson guitars an especially attractive target for counterfeiters, who can easily undersell the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, and still make a hefty profit off unsuspecting consumers.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gibson.com/en-US/Online-Dealers" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">authorized sellers</a> like Guitar Center would never carry those, the fake guitars were destined for third-party online resellers, officials said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There is a much better chance of a consumer getting hoodwinked if they can’t see the instrument directly, or hold and play it.</p><p>“We can pick it up immediately and tell,” Ms. Heidt said of a phony Gibson, adding that they were more flimsy and lightweight.</p><p>She said that a fake guitar would carry a Gibson logo that might look askew, bleed, or be in the wrong place.</p><p>“They don’t have correct inlays,” she said. “There are finish issues. The way the neck is fit into the guitar is inaccurate. So there’s quite a few ways that you can actually look at the guitar and tell that it’s not accurate. It’s from the parts, the specs, the look, the feel, top to bottom.”</p><p>Customs officers worked with special agents from Homeland Security Investigations and investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department to make the bust, but they did not say how long they had been working on the case, when the counterfeit guitars were seized, who made them or where they came from. They said it remained an active investigation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>It is a violation of intellectual property law to import, distribute or sell unauthorized products in the United States.
