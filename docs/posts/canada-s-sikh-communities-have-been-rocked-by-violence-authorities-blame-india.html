Avoid public spaces. Enhance security at home.</p><p>The first person he called — a friend and fellow activist in a campaign promoting an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India — had just gotten the same ominous warning.</p><p>A year later, that friend, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was dead.</p><h2 id="link-5c54057">Murder at the Temple</h2><p>Mr. Nijjar was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/world/canada/arrests-hardeep-singh-nijjar-india.html" title="">gunned down</a> in June 2023 by masked men outside a Sikh temple he led in British Columbia. The Canadian government blamed the Indian government for the killing, setting off an extraordinary diplomatic rift.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Now, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canadian law enforcement officials have painted an even darker picture: Mr. Nijjar’s assassination, they said, was part of a broader criminal campaign run by India that targeted Sikhs on Canadian soil and included harassment, intimidation, extortion and the killing of at least one other person.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrators in Toronto demanding an independent Sikh enclave in India. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian Willms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The campaign was orchestrated, officials said, by India’s ambassador in Canada and other diplomats out of the embassy in Ottawa and consulates in Toronto and Vancouver.</p><p>The Canadian authorities say that they will not release evidence linking individual cases to the Indian government because investigations are still underway.</p><p>But a review of court records and interviews with local police officials uncovered new details of a surge in such crimes in Sikh communities over the past year, including in at least a dozen alleged extortion episodes involving firearms and arson outside Toronto.</p><p>The spike began soon after Mr. Nijjar’s killing and Mr. Trudeau’s accusation in September last year that India was behind it according to community leaders, the court documents and law enforcement officials familiar with the cases outside Toronto. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly while the investigation is underway.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Trudeau and the federal authorities said they had decided to issue a broad warning about criminal activity backed by India even without releasing evidence because of “a grave concern for our public safety.” Local authorities said they could not link any cases examined by The Times to India, saying such evidence would need to come from intelligence agencies.</p><p>This month, citing the violence, Canada <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/canada/india-canada-diplomats.html" title="">expelled India’s high commissioner</a>, or ambassador, Sanjay Kumar Verma, and five other diplomats. India angrily denounced the accusations and expelled six Canadian diplomats.</p><p>Canada’s accusations have echoes to parallel events in the United States.</p><p>After Mr. Nijjar’s killing in Surrey, British Columbia, the F.B.I. last year charged an Indian government employee with plotting to assassinate a Sikh activist in New York. More recently, the authorities charged an Indian intelligence officer in the same case.</p><p>The public accusations suggest that the United States and Canada are increasing their pressure on India — a longstanding partner — to rein in what they describe as state-sponsored violence within their borders.</p><h2 id="link-44872849">Bad Blood</h2><p>India has largely stamped out Sikh secessionist aspirations at home. Most Sikhs who support the creation of an independent enclave they call Khalistan live overseas, with Canada home to the largest Sikh diaspora.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some 800,000 Sikhs are concentrated in British Columbia and Ontario, making up about 2 percent of Canada’s population.</p><p>Most are not involved in the Khalistan movement, but those who are say life in Canada has been punctuated by violence and intimidation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Moninder Singh says he was warned by the Canadian authorities that he was a target for assassination. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Singh, reeling from Mr. Nijjar’s killing, received several more warnings of imminent risk to his life from the Canadian authorities. Three other Sikh activists from their temple had also gotten initial warnings two years ago, Mr. Singh said.</p><p>They were all instantly certain where the threat was originating.</p><p>“I felt this was India trying to silence us, to either actually physically eliminate us or scare us into sitting at home and stepping away from the movement,” Mr. Singh said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It won’t work, he said: “I know I’d rather die than let that happen. Hardeep Singh proved his conviction with sacrificing his life.”</p><p>But Mr. Singh did temporarily move out of his home to protect his family, he said.</p><p>India has called Canada’s accusations “preposterous.” The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims that Mr. Trudeau is pandering to Canada’s Sikhs because they are an important voting bloc for his party, the Liberals.</p><p>India has long believed that Canada has not done enough to root out what it believes is Sikh extremism.</p><p>Sikh nationalists were implicated in Canada’s deadliest terrorist act: a 1985 suitcase bombing of an Air India flight from Montreal to India via London that killed all 329 on board. Twenty years later, a judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/world/americas/canadian-sikhs-are-cleared-in-1985-air-india-bombing.html" title="">acquitted two Indian-born Sikh nationalists</a> who lived in Canada of murder charges. A third man had earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter.</p><p>One of the men acquitted in the Air India case, Ripudaman Singh Malik, was killed in 2022 in Canada, and this week two men pleaded guilty to his murder. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sikh nationalists were implicated in Canada’s deadliest terrorist act: a 1985  suitcase bombing of an Air India flight.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Andre Durand/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Vincent Rigby, a former national security and intelligence adviser to Mr. Trudeau, said that the rift between Canada and India dated back to the bombing.</p><p>The Indian government believes that “the Canadian government did not do enough to prevent that, and the Indians have repeatedly said to Canada over the last 40 years: You’ve got to do more,” said Mr. Rigby, who was also a senior official at the public safety, foreign and defense departments before he retired.</p><p>“Their mind-set has been: ‘We told you to up your game with respect to the Sikh extremism, to do more to address this issue. You haven’t done it,’’’ he said.</p><p>Today the pro-Khalistan movement is involved in organizing “referendums” among the diaspora in favor of an independent Sikh homeland, protesting India’s government, and disseminating pro-Khalistan information.

The caller demanded that they transfer 200,000 Canadian dollars ($144,000) into a bank account or face physical harm.</p><p>He dismissed the calls as a prank, and they decided not to pay, but the calls made his brother nervous.</p><p>Fifteen years earlier, the two Sikh siblings had moved from India to Canada. They became Canadian and built up their business. Mr. Sidhu said that neither he nor his brother have links to the Khalistan movement.</p><p>One morning after he got the threatening phone call, as he was walking to the car dealership, Mr. Sidhu had a phone conversation with his brother that he had never expected. “If anything happens to me look after my family please and don’t worry about the business,” his brother told him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A car dealership in Brampton owned and operated by two Sikh brothers where 12 vehicles were damaged by gunfire.

CCTV footage reviewed by The Times showed three hooded men coming into the parking lot and, moving vehicle by vehicle, shooting at the tires using pistols, then calmly leaving.</p><p>Mr. Sidhu said the authorities had not said whether the targeting of his business was anything more than thuggery, nor did they suggest it was linked to the Indian government.</p><p>Ruby Sahota, a member of Parliament representing northern Brampton who serves as the Liberal government’s chief whip, and is herself Sikh, said her constituents started calling her to report such incidents late last year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>“People were being victimized in this manner,” she said in an interview. “The pace of it, it was alarming beyond belief, and the grief people had and sense of insecurity.
