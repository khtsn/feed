The ensemble said in a letter to audience members that Gillham had made “unauthorized statements” that represented an “intrusion of personal political views” on a piano recital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I was really surprised,” Gillham said in an interview. “It felt like an overreaction.”</p><p>A backlash followed: Artists, journalists and music fans in Australia denounced the Melbourne Symphony for canceling Gillham’s performance and defended his right to free speech. The orchestra backtracked, issuing a <a href="https://www.mso.com.au/performance/2024-mozart-and-brahms" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> saying it had been wrong to cancel Gillham’s appearance and that it would work to reschedule it. It wound up canceling the Beethoven performance, citing “safety concerns.”</p><p>But the fallout has continued.</p><p>On Monday, the Melbourne Symphony announced that its managing director, Sophie Galaise, was departing. The ensemble said it was commissioning an outside investigation into the incident, to be led by <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/now-a-politician-former-midnight-oil-singer-votes-nay-on-new-beds-are-burning-recording/" title="">Peter Garrett</a>, the former lead singer of the Australian rock band Midnight Oil, who has also been a government minister.</p><p>“The board recognizes the past few weeks has been a difficult experience for many of our people,” the Melbourne Symphony said in a <a href="https://www.mso.com.au/media-centre/press-releases/mso-announces-garrett-review" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. “There is a clear understanding that we need to learn from these events to ensure the M.S.O. is best positioned to continue offering world-class cultural experiences for our valued audiences.”</p><p>The controversy is the latest example of the challenges facing performing arts institutions as they navigate the politics of the Israel-Hamas war.</p><p>In Australia, the incident has drawn widespread attention. Some commentators have argued that Gillham was wrong for bringing politics into the recital hall and have accused him of holding anti-Israel views.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Others have faulted the orchestra’s managers, including Galaise, for infringing on his right to free speech, saying that the orchestra had overstepped in seeking to punish Gillham for speaking out.</p><p>The orchestra’s musicians recently passed a vote of no-confidence in the administration. “We no longer have faith in the abilities of our senior management to make decisions that are in the best interests of the company at large,” the musicians wrote.</p><p>The Cat Empire, a jazz and funk band, canceled a planned performance this month with the orchestra, <a href="https://x.com/thecatempire/status/1824355157406257375" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writing on social media</a> that it felt “deep sadness” over the cancellation of Gillham’s concert. “We value the principles of freedom of speech, artistic expression and inclusivity,” the group said.</p><p>Prue Bassett, a spokeswoman for the symphony, declined to comment. The orchestra said on Monday that the inquiry would evaluate the orchestra’s “policies, procedures and processes and cover protocols around freedom of speech and artistic expression onstage.”</p><p>D’Netto, the composer, said in an email that he wrote “Witness” to honor the “bravery and sacrifice” of journalists in Gaza. “Art, including classical music, has always been connected to the world around it, including its politics,” he said, citing works by Beethoven and Shostakovich.</p><p>Gillham, an Australian-British pianist who is based in London, said he planned to play “Witness” during the remainder of his tour in Australia. He said that he and D’Netto are working on a recorded version as well.</p><p>“People want to hear the piece now,” he said. “There’s a perception that everything in classical music is from 200 years ago and it’s not relevant. But through this work, we’ve shown that there is a space to talk about modern issues as well.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Javier C.
