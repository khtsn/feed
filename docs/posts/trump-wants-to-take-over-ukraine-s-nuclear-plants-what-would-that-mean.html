floated a highly unusual idea: The United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">could take control</a> of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.</p><p>“The United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise,” the White House said in a statement after the call on Wednesday. “American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.”</p><p>The idea surprised officials and energy experts in Kyiv, and it was not clear whether Mr. Zelensky would agree to such a plan. Ukraine owns four nuclear power plants, and it also appears that the two sides do not agree on how many facilities the idea concerns.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky suggested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html" title="">at a news conference</a> that the idea was limited to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which is now under Russian control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Ukrainian leader described his discussions with Mr. Trump about the plant as “positive steps,” but added, “I’m not sure we will get a result quickly.”</p><p>The White House statement echoed a familiar argument from Mr. Trump: that U.S. economic involvement in Ukraine serves as its best security guarantee, because Russia would be less likely to target a country where America has economic interests. Mr. Trump has also applied such reasoning to a potential deal on access to Ukrainian critical minerals.</p><p>So what could the United States’ interests be in Ukraine’s nuclear sector, and what challenges might it face?</p><h2 id="link-46fdc9df">U.S. Economic Interests</h2><p>Ukraine’s Soviet-era nuclear power plants have been the backbone of its energy network during the war, supplying up to two-thirds of the country’s electricity. While Moscow has relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s thermal and hydroelectric power plants in an effort to cripple its grid, it has avoided striking nuclear facilities, which could trigger a radiological disaster.</p><p>Against that background, the Ukrainian government has initiated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/ukraine-nuclear-reactor-purchase.html" title="">plans to build more nuclear reactors</a>, arguing that it is the only viable solution to ensuring long-term energy security.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>This is where America’s business interests could come into play.</p><p>Shortly before the war, Westinghouse, an American nuclear technology company, signed a deal with Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned nuclear company, to build five reactors. After Russia attacked, the <a href="https://energoatom.com.ua/en/news/budivnictvo-novix-energoblokiv-aes" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">number was increased to nine</a> and the two companies agreed to further cooperate to <a href="https://energoatom.com.ua/en/news/12-veresnya-2023-roku-energoatom-ta-westinghouse-domovilisya-pro-spivpracyu-u-rozgortanni-v-ukrayini-malogo-modulnogo-reaktora-ap300" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deploy smaller plants in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>For Westinghouse, it was a breakthrough after years of struggling to enter a Ukrainian nuclear market long dominated by Rosatom, the Russian nuclear power giant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Patrick Fragman, the chief executive of Westinghouse, speaking in Ukraine last April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sergei Supinsky/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Westinghouse has a special interest in the six-reactor Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Russia captured the plant in March 2022, and it no longer supplies electricity to the Ukrainian grid. But before the war, it used fuel and technology from Westinghouse.</p><p>Olga Kosharna, a Ukrainian nuclear safety expert, said that Russia’s capture of the Zaporizhzhia plant had raised concerns at Westinghouse about the potential theft of its intellectual property. In 2023, the U.S. Energy Department <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-04-18-23#h_358d97fbee9db908b910c0cb9a4218fa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> in a <a href="https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/rf-zavolodila-sekretnimi-kodami-zaporizkiy-1681395161.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> to Rosatom that the company could face prosecution under U.S. law if it used Westinghouse technology at the plant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Andrian Prokip, an energy expert with the Kennan Institute in Washington, said that Westinghouse would “definitely benefit” from a return of the plant to Ukrainian hands, as it would expand its market. </p><p>It is unclear whether Mr. Trump discussed the fate of the Zaporizhzhia plant with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in a call on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/europe/putin-trump-russia-ukraine.html" title="">as he had vowed to</a>.</p><p>Westinghouse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A current Ukrainian official and a former one, both with knowledge of the talks between the United States and Ukraine, also said Kyiv had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/europe/ukraine-nuclear-plant-cease-fire-talks.html" title="">emphasized to Mr. Trump that if the United States wanted access to Ukrainian minerals</a>, it would require the Zaporizhzhia plant’s power-generating capacity, because mineral extraction and processing is energy intensive.</p><h2 id="link-453fccef">Possible Challenges</h2><p>For one thing, all of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants are owned by Energoatom, and <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/847-14#Text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ukrainian law</a> prohibits their privatization.</p><p>Amending Ukraine’s laws to allow for U.S. ownership would be politically sensitive in a post-Soviet country where many key industries remain state-owned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Ukraine has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/world/europe/ukraine-privatization-war.html" title="">engaged in a wave of privatization</a> during the war. But privatizing Energoatom — the state-owned company that <a href="https://energoatom.com.ua/en/news/energoatom-posiv-tretye-misce-sered-ukrayinskih-kompanij-za-vitorgom-u-2023-roci-ta-pershe-sered-derzhavnih" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generates the most revenue</a> — would likely be a sticking point.</p><p>“I expect there would be great resistance to this idea in Ukraine,” said Victoria Voytsitska, a former Ukrainian lawmaker and senior member of Parliament’s energy committee. “From both sides of the political spectrum.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Energoatom’s headquarters in Kyiv in 2022.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Tung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Zelensky alluded to the issue in his news conference after his call with Mr. Trump. If Russia returned the Zaporizhzhia plant to Ukraine — a prospect that many in Ukraine deem unlikely — “simply handing over the plant” to the United States would not be possible, Mr. Zelensky said, because “it’s ours and it’s our land.”</p><p>Making plants operational again after three years of war would also pose a considerable challenge. Mr. Zelensky cited a period of up to two and a half years to get the degraded Zaporizhzhia plant running again.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Further, although all six Zaporizhzhia reactors have been shut down, they still require energy to power critical safety systems and water to circulate in their cores to prevent a meltdown.</p><p>But the power lines providing power to the plant have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/world/europe/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-power-grid.html" title="">cut on several occasions</a> in the war, and the destruction of a nearby dam, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/16/world/europe/ukraine-kakhovka-dam-collapse.html" title="">possibly at Russia’s direction</a>, has reduced access to cooling water, raising the risks of a nuclear accident.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/03/20/world/europe/trump-ukraine-nuclear-plants.html">18</a></span></p></div></span></p><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/03/20/world/europe/trump-ukraine-nuclear-plants.html">18</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Energy Infrastructure Strikes: </strong>Russia said it would agree to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia-ceasefire.html">limited cease-fire</a> that would stop attacks on energy targets as long as Ukraine does the same. Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia-energy-infrastructure.html">what that could mean for both countries</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Putin Digs In</strong><strong>:</strong> Although much of what President Vladimir Putin of Russia agreed to during his call with President Trump was spun as a concession, the Russian leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/europe/trump-putin-call-russia-ukraine-war.html">stuck to the positions he has long held</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kidnapped Ukrainian Children</strong><strong>:</strong> The State Department has ended funding for the tracking of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, and American officials or contractors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-ukraine-abducted-children.html">might have deleted a database with information on them</a>, according to a letter U.S. lawmakers sent to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fresh Sushi in a Frontline Town</strong><strong>: </strong>Sushi has long been a popular indulgence in Ukraine.
