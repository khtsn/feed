The discovery came hours after the authorities had narrowed the search based on information they collected over the weekend about their father’s whereabouts.</p><p>The Wenatchee Police Department did not say how the girls were killed.</p><p>The girl’s mother reported them missing around 9:45 p.m. Friday after they did not return from a scheduled visitation with their father, Travis Decker, 32. It’s unclear how long the girls had been missing before their mother called the Wenatchee Police Department.</p><p>“It was late enough that she felt the need to call police because it was out of the ordinary,” said Capt. Brian Chance of the Wenatchee Police Department.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Officers searched for Mr. Decker’s last known vehicle, a white GMC Sierra. Mr. Decker lived out of his car and, at times, hotels, the police said.</p><p>On Monday, the authorities found Mr. Decker’s vehicle empty near the Rock Island Campground.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The police say Travis Decker, 32, was last seen driving on a highway on Friday. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Wenatchee Police Department</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>A subsequent search of the area led to the discovery of the children’s bodies. Mr. Decker, who was last seen driving on a highway on Friday, was still at large on Tuesday and several law enforcement agencies were searching for him.</p><p>Mr. Decker is facing three counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping.</p><p>“It’s a remote area and everything points to him having been involved,” Captain Chance said.</p><p>Captain Chance said that Mr. Decker’s Army experience makes him dangerous and could help him evade capture. It’s unclear if Mr. Decker is armed, he said, warning against attempts to contact or approach Mr. Decker.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Walker is an investigative reporter for The Times focused on transportation.
