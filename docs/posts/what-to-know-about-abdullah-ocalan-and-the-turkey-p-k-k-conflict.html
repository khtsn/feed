Turkey, the United States and other countries consider the group a terrorist organization.</p><p>Now, the group’s imprisoned founder, Abdullah Ocalan, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/middleeast/turkey-pkk-abdullah-ocalan.html" title="">called on Kurdish fighters to lay down their arms</a> — although it remains unclear how effective his plea will be and what, if anything, the Turkish government is offering the group in exchange for ending the fighting.</p><p>Here is what to know about the P.K.K. and its conflict with Turkey.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-7c5a9a14">Who are the P.K.K.?</h2><p>The group began fighting the Turkish state in the early 1980s, originally seeking independence for the Kurds, who are believed to make up about 15 percent or more of Turkey’s population.</p><p>Starting from the mountains in eastern and southern Turkey, P.K.K. fighters attacked Turkish military bases and police stations, prompting harsh government responses. Later, the conflict spread to other parts of the country, with devastating P.K.K. bombings in Turkish cities that killed many civilians.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Ocalan in 1993.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Joseph Barrak/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Over the last decade, the Turkish military has routed P.K.K. forces from major Kurdish cities in southeastern Turkey, while using drones to kill its leaders and fighters, hindering its ability to organize and carry out attacks.</p><p>The conflict has been on a low boil for years, although occasional P.K.K. attacks have revived fears of a wider conflict. Last year, a small squad of its militants stormed into the headquarters of a state-run aerospace company armed with rifles and explosives and killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/world/middleeast/turkey-attack.html" title="">five employees</a> before the security forces regained control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-1ed4998a">Who is Abdullah Ocalan?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/world/middleeast/pkk-leader-abdullah-ocalan.html" title="">Mr. Ocalan is the founder and leader</a> of the P.K.K., which has been battling the Turkish state. He has been in a Turkish prison for a quarter century.</p><p>Many of Turkey’s Kurds view Mr. Ocalan as a potent symbol of the struggle for Kurdish rights. And despite his imprisonment, he still wields great influence over the P.K.K. and its affiliated militias in Syria, Iraq and Iran.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Ocalan in 1992.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ramzi Haidar/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr. Ocalan founded the P.K.K. in the late 1970s with a group of other rebels and largely ran the organization from neighboring Syria as it launched attacks in southeastern Turkey and later in other major Turkish cities.</p><p>In 1998, Syria forced him out and he traveled to Greece, Italy and Russia to seek asylum before Turkish intelligence agents, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/20/world/us-helped-turkey-find-and-capture-kurd-rebel.html" title="">with help from their U.S. counterparts</a>, captured him inside a plane at an airport in Nairobi, Kenya, on Feb. 15, 1999.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After his capture in 1999, he was incarcerated on Imrali Island in the Sea of Marmara, south of Istanbul, where he was the only prisoner for many years.</p><p>That same year, Turkey convicted him and sentenced him to death. That sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after Turkey abolished the death penalty as part of its bid to join the European Union.</p><p>Since his incarceration, Mr. Ocalan has shifted its ideology away from secession and toward Kurdish rights inside Turkey.</p><h2 id="link-63cc890b">How does Turkey see Mr. Ocalan?</h2><p>For most Turks, Mr. Ocalan remains the country’s most hated terrorist.</p><p>Human rights groups criticized his isolation on Imrali Island. In 2009, five other prisoners were sent to the facility, and Mr. Ocalan was allowed to meet them a few times a week, according to Turkish media reports.</p><p>But in recent years, Mr. Ocalan and the island’s other inmates were not allowed any visitors, including their lawyers, or any phone calls with family members.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Last October, a powerful political ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/world/middleeast/turkey-terrorist-attack-kurdish-peace-talks.html" title="">a surprising public call</a> to Mr. Ocalan, requesting that he tell his fighters to lay down their arms and end the conflict.</p><p>That led to limited visits from relatives and political allies of Mr. Ocalan to explore the possibility of a new peace process between Turkey and the P.K.K.</p><h2 id="link-2fa1d7f3">Who are the Kurds?</h2><p>The Kurds are an ethnic group of roughly 40 million people — there are widely varying estimates — concentrated in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey.</p><p>They speak multiple dialects of Kurdish, a language not directly related to Turkish or Arabic. Most are Sunni Muslims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The Kurds were promised a nation of their own by world powers after World War I, but that was never granted. There were Kurdish rebellions in various countries over the following generations, and Kurds have faced state suppression of their language and culture.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kurdish Syrians, who were forced to flee ISIS fighting in northern Syria, waited for transportation to refugee camps after crossing the border into Turkey in 2014.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bryan Denton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, whose leaders have roots in the P.K.K. and follow Mr. Ocalan’s ideology, controls the northeastern part of the country. They have been backed for years by the United States and played a crucial role in defeating the Islamic State.</p><p>But the fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/kurdish-forces-syria-turkey-isis-america.html" title="">left their future status unclear</a>. They are clashing with Turkish-backed Syrian Arab rebels, and remain outside of the control of the new Syrian government in Damascus.</p><p>Since the 1991 Gulf War, the largely Kurdish northern region of Iraq has been semiautonomous. The P.K.K. leadership is now based in the Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq. In recent years, Turkey has attacked the group and affiliated militias in Iraq and Syria while lobbying the Iraqi government to expel it.</p><h2 id="link-64b27beb">How did previous peace efforts fare?</h2><p>Multiple efforts to freeze or end the Turkey-P.K.K. conflict have been made, starting with a cease-fire in 1993. But all of them collapsed, often leading to greater bloodshed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Violence flared on and off until a new round of peace talks began in 2011. At that time, Turkish intelligence officers met with Mr. Ocalan in prison to map out a plan for his fighters to disarm, and Kurdish politicians ferried messages between him and his associates in northern Iraq.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>P.K.K. fighters in Zargali, in the northern Iraq, in 2013.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adam Ferguson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>But the process collapsed in mid-2015, with each side blaming the other for the failure. One of the conflict’s most deadly phases followed, with pitched battles in cities in Turkey’s southeast that killed more than 7,000 people, <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/content/turkiyes-pkk-conflict-visual-explainer" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the International Crisis Group.</a></p><h2 id="link-4cc1a9c2">Will this time be different?</h2><p>Although Turkey still considers the P.K.K. a <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/pkk.en.mfa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">separatist terrorist group</a> that does not represent the Kurdish people, it has acknowledged some historic violations of Kurdish rights and widened the margins for Kurdish language and culture.</p><p>It has licensed Kurdish-language television and radio broadcasts and allowed Kurdish language as an elective course in some schools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>At the same time, however, the government has removed more than 150 elected Kurdish mayors from their posts since 2015, according to the Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party, which represents the pro-Kurdish movement politically and has seats in Parliament.</p><p>Most of the removed mayors were accused, and some convicted, of crimes related to the P.K.K.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/02/07/turkey-kurdish-mayors-removal-violates-voters-rights" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called the removal of Kurdish mayors politically motivated</a> and a violation of voters’ rights.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
