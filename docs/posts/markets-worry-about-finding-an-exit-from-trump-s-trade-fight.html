That’s after the Trump administration placed 145 percent tariffs on imports from China; the White House has also put 10 percent tariffs on most other trade partners as it faces a 90-day deadline to reach scores of trade deals.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Meanwhile:</p><ul><li><p>The dollar is falling sharply again, having suffered its biggest drop against the euro in a decade.</p></li><li><p>The 30-year Treasury bond is more stable, but is on track for its worst week since the 1980s, according to Deutsche Bank research.</p></li><li><p>West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, is trading around $60. Its significant drop this week is being cheered on by the White House, but could <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-04-11/oil-slump-risks-breaking-best-us-deficit-tool?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exacerbate the trade deficit</a>, Bloomberg Opinion’s Javier Blas writes.</p></li><li><p>Just in: <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2025/1st-quarter/d88c408a-bbc9-4b06-b263-373f5b10b145.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JPMorgan Chase reported gains</a> in its core consumer lending, investment banking and trading businesses for the first quarter. But Jamie Dimon, the bank’s C.E.O., warned that “the economy is facing considerable turbulence.”</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>Watch the market volatility closely. </strong>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that he saw “<a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/us-treasury-chief-says-nothing-unusual-in-markets-despite-slump-a72510f2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nothing unusual</a>” about the market swings. But<strong> </strong>simultaneous<strong> </strong>drops in the dollar, stocks and long-dated Treasury bonds are extreme, especially in the United States, and suggest a potentially larger capital flight away from U.S. financial assets, analysts noted.</p><p>The sell-off in bonds in particular <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariff-pause-be-cool.html" title="">appeared to spook the White House</a> into pausing most of its reciprocal tariffs.</p><p><strong>Bondholders remain wary.</strong> They appear concerned about the inflationary effects of tariffs, “squeezing margins and reducing household real incomes,” Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg, wrote in a research note this morning. Berenberg forecasts that the yield on the 10-year treasury note will rise to 4.8 percent, up from about 4.4 percent this morning.</p><p><strong>Investors appear to be worried about what’s next for the “Trump put,”</strong> shorthand for the president walking back policies that could hurt the economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Because Trump has shown that he will listen to the bond market, the thinking goes, he has lost negotiating leverage — especially since he is seeking allies to team up against China. That means other trading partners can demand things from the U.S., and not, as the White House wants, the other way around.</p><p>Thursday’s market plunge seems tied in part to a growing belief that the only way for Trump to get out of this predicament is walk away from his fight altogether.</p><p><em>We’d like to know how the tariffs have affected your business. Have you changed suppliers? Negotiated lower prices? Paused investments or hiring? Made plans to move manufacturing to the U. S.? Please </em><a href="mailto:dealbook@nytimes.com" title=""><em>let us know</em></a><em> what you’re doing.</em></p><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>The House passes a Trump-endorsed budget blueprint.</strong> Holdout Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/house-budget-vote-trump-republicans.html" title="">dropped their opposition to the plan</a>, which seeks drastic cuts to taxes and government spending, despite their concerns that it would significantly increase the national debt. But party leaders in both chambers have yet to agree on how much spending to cut, and where.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p><strong>Elon Musk appears to drop his cost-cutting target again.</strong> In a cabinet meeting on Thursday, the billionaire said that his so-called Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/musk-doge-drops-goal.html" title="">anticipates cutting $150 billion</a> in the 2026 fiscal year, which runs from October 2025 to September 2026. It’s unclear whether Musk meant that number was what his team had identified so far, or all it expected to achieve, but it’s well below the $2 trillion he pledged last year. (A White House official said $1 trillion remains the goal.)</p><p><strong>More law firms near deals with Trump.</strong> The president told his cabinet that four or five firms were close to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/trump-law-firms.html" title="">committing $125 million each</a> to do pro bono work — more than others have pledged. Among those that have held talks with Trump advisers in recent days are Latham &amp; Watkins, Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, according to The Times. It’s the latest sign of corporate law firms bending to Trump to avoid facing his wrath.</p><p><strong>Republican lawmakers target the Ivy League over claims of price fixing.</strong> The Senate and House Judiciary committees began inquiries into the eight universities to examine whether they were violating antitrust laws by collaborating over tuition policies. It represents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html" title="">another attack</a> on higher education institutions. Relatedly, the Trump administration is looking to place Columbia University <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/nyregion/columbia-trump-consent-decree.html" title="">under a consent decree</a>.</p><h2 id="link-b663214">More scrutiny for trading around tariff reversal </h2><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has sent a letter to the S.E.C. <a href="https://nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/dealbook/warren-trump-sec.html" title="">asking the agency to investigate</a> whether President Trump violated securities laws while reversing course on his global tariffs on Wednesday, Lauren Hirsch is first to report.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>It is far from certain Warren’s request will lead to an investigation. But the letter — whose signatories include Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader — underscores how much scrutiny Trump’s comments before he announced a 90-day pause on tariffs are getting.</p><p><strong>Trading around Trump’s tariff U-turn was dizzying</strong>. During a period of intensely volatile trading, Mr. Trump wrote on social media, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” Hours later, he announced a 90-day pause on many of his reciprocal tariffs, sending the S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/trump-tariffs-stock-markets.html" title="">soaring more than 7 percent</a> in just minutes. It was the best day for the benchmark index since the fall of 2008.</p><p>The Times has reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-tariff-pause-be-cool.html" title="">Trump’s change of heart</a> on tariffs followed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/business/economy/bonds-tariffs-safe-haven.html" title="">rapid rise in bond yields</a> and increasing concern about the economic fallout of the levies.</p><p><strong>Warren wants to know who knew what, and when. </strong>“In recent days, President Trump has announced a series of erratic, reckless tariffs, leading to significant market turmoil,” Warren wrote.</p><p>“It is unclear which officials and affiliates of President Trump had advance knowledge of his plans to delay tariffs — but insiders may have known that he was going to announce a tariff pause and that the market would improve.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A spokesman for the White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p><strong>Others have made similar requests. </strong>Representative Maxine Waters. Democrat of California, sent a letter to the S.E.C. and the U.S. Government Accountability Office on Thursday. Of particular concern to her was a spike in trading of call options — bets that a stock will rise — in the period directly leading up to Trump’s announcement of the pause on tariffs.</p><p>“The timing and scale of the call option purchases would suggest that an official of the Administration, or perhaps the President himself, provided friends or associates with a heads up that the announcement was happening,” Waters wrote.</p><p><strong>Market volatility makes it hard to assess wrongdoing. </strong>Financial experts said they saw no immediate proof of insider trading, and that many of the spikes in buying Wednesday occurred at the same time as the announcement. “Speed is not illegal,” said Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.</p><p>But given the heavy trading volume surrounding Trump’s announcement, it would be difficult to detect illegal activity from looking at market moves alone.</p><p>“Just because I can’t find a smoking gun doesn’t mean there wasn’t one,” Sosnick added.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-214908b0">“Last fall, I asked teammates across the company to send me bureaucracy examples that they were experiencing.

And <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5236142-congress-tariff-bill-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven Republican senators</a> have signed on to another bipartisan bill that would give Congress <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-weigh-using-power-congress-rein-trump-tariffs-rcna199555" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 60-day window</a> to approve new tariffs imposed by the president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>On Thursday, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska called on her fellow lawmakers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/10/business/trump-tariffs-stocks/6f906833-e8bd-590e-bf4b-4236939c2028?smid=url-share" title="">reassert their authority over tariffs</a>.</p><p>But those bills aren’t likely to pass in the House, with Speaker Mike Johnson saying Monday that his chamber would <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/07/congress/house-will-give-trump-space-on-tariffs-johnson-says-00276498" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">give Trump “space” to enact his tariffs</a>. Even if Congress were to pass such legislation, Trump would probably veto it — a move that could only be overturned with a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate.</p><p><strong>The bills also ignore a bigger question. </strong>The Constitution grants Congress, not the president, control over levies. “The idea shouldn’t be that Congress gets permission to approve what the president does,” Sracic said. “The argument should be, can the president do this?”</p><p>The Supreme Court has previously ruled that the executive branch cannot claim authority to decide “<a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12077" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major questions</a>” of economic and political significance unless Congress has <em>clearly</em> delegated it.</p><p><strong>Legal challenges are already underway. </strong>The libertarian New Civil Liberties Alliance, a nonprofit that has <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/480918408_201712_990PF_2019012816035874.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously received funding</a> from the Charles Koch Foundation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/economy/lawsuit-tariffs-china-trump-administration.html" title="">filed a lawsuit last week</a> over the Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of the most powerful business lobbying groups in Washington, is also said to be considering a legal challenge to Trump’s global tariffs, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/chamber-of-commerce-lawsuit-trump-tariffs-liberation-day/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Fortune</a>. The Retail Industry Leaders Association began planning to sue over the tariffs, but put the efforts on hold because <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/top-us-retailers-balked-at-challenging-trump-tariffs-in-court" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">members feared angering Trump</a>, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>And the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal has also pointed out specific limits on Trump’s power to apply tariffs. “Someone should sue to block his abuse of power,” it argued.</p><p><strong>The administration’s argument: </strong>Trump is relying on a 1977 law that gives the president expanded powers during an emergency. In imposing tariffs on China in February, Trump cited what he said was a surge of illegal drugs from the country; on the worldwide tolls, he called the U.S. trade deficit “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.”</p><p>In its lawsuit, the New Civil Liberties Alliance argues that the 1977 law does not grant the president the authority to enact broad tariffs. Even if Congress wanted to give the president that authority, it could not, since the Constitution specifically gives it to the legislature. “It’s a non-delegation problem,” Sracic said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><h3 id="link-7c091e00"><span>THE SPEED READ </span></h3><p><strong>Deals</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/style/prada-versace-deal.html" title="">Prada agreed to buy Versace</a>, an embattled rival luxury fashion label, for $1.38 billion despite uncertainty about President Trump’s tariff fight.
