The filing does not directly bring legal claims against Ali Fayed; instead, it lays the groundwork for evidence to be collected for legal disputes in other countries.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The details in the filing are the latest in a series of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/world/europe/mohamed-al-fayed-harrods-rape.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/world/europe/mohamed-al-fayed-harrods-rape.html" title="">allegations of abuse</a> and trafficking made against Mr. al-Fayed, who is accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/world/europe/harrods-sexual-abuse-scandal-mohamed-al-fayed.html" title="">using Harrods</a> as a hunting ground for young women after he bought the department store with his two brothers, Ali and Salah, in 1985.

She said that she is seeking evidence from Ali Fayed for use in that litigation.</p><p>She also said in the petition that she is seeking a government inquiry into the systemic failures that allowed the abuse of many women to continue for more than two decades, and to be concealed for a decade longer, allowing Mr. al-Fayed “to escape accountability.”</p><p>A judge will now review the petition, and if it is successful, Ali Fayed could be required to turn over documents and sit for a deposition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ali Fayed<span>  </span>could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Harrods, in response to a request to comment on the new allegations on Tuesday said, “Mr. Ali Fayed ceased to be a director when the business changed ownership in 2010.” The company acknowledged <a href="https://www.harrods.com/en-gb/c/press?srsltid=AfmBOopLhfOoYE65jOIc6uSqvLgpcPVpGNtNAJt1tTsLWnhpy9OSDN9T" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement in September</a> that it had “failed our employees” who were Mr. al-Fayed’s victims and announced that it had established a claims program to consider and resolve claims by its former employees.</p><h2 id="link-ffc1fac">Harrowing allegations of abuse by al-Fayed</h2><p>Ms. Doe said in the court petition that she was hired by Harrods at age 19 in the mid-1990s to work as a salesperson, but was soon interviewed by Mr. al-Fayed and invited to work in Harrods’ executive training program and report directly to his office. She said she was given a medical examination arranged by Harrods that included an AIDS test.</p><p>Ms. Doe said in the court filing that she was then taken by Mr. al-Fayed aboard a Harrods helicopter and Harrods private plane, and was trafficked, raped and “brutally abused” over a “substantial period of time” while being subject to surveillance.</p><p>Ms. Doe said she interacted with Ali Fayed on multiple occasions in this period, detailing in the filing that he joked about her working as a secretary, and that she heard him making arrangements for a woman to be made available to him in London.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The filing represents the latest in a series of allegations of abuse made against Mr. al-Fayed, who is accused of using Harrods as a hunting ground for young women.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mina Kim/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>She said that during this period she was shown explicit Polaroid photographs of other women or girls who she believed were physically and sexually abused.
