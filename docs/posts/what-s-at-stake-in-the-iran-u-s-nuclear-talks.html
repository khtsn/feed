Nobody else could do that,” President Trump <a href="https://time.com/7280114/donald-trump-2025-interview-transcript/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in an interview with Time magazine</a> published on Friday. Mr. Trump abandoned a previous nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 during his first term, saying it was a flawed agreement.</p><p>The talks have the potential to reshape regional and global security by reducing the chance of a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from producing a nuclear weapon. A deal could also transform Iran’s economic and political landscape by easing American sanctions and opening the country up to foreign investors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-6f5b1c20">What’s happening on Saturday?</h2><p>Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy; Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister; and teams of technical experts from both sides will meet in the Gulf sultanate of Oman, which is mediating the talks.</p><p>This round will include the nuts-and-bolts “expert talks,” which bring together nuclear and financial teams from both sides to hash out technical details. These could include issues such as the monitoring of Iran’s nuclear facilities, its uranium enrichment levels and what will happen to its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium<strong>, </strong>along with easing sanctions.</p><p>Mr. Trump himself has defined the objective of the negotiations as preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Officials in his administration, however, have sent mixed messages about what that means. Saturday’s talks could help clarify the outlines of a deal.</p><h2 id="link-4260b111">What’s at stake?</h2><p>A new nuclear agreement could delay or avert a broader conflict between Iran and Israel and the United States. Israel and Iran have traded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/world/middleeast/iran-israel-strike.html" title="">direct attacks</a> since the war in Gaza began in 2023.</p><p>Last week, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-israel-iran-nuclear.html" title="">reported</a> that Israel had planned to attack Iranian nuclear sites as soon as next month, but it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-israel-iran-nuclear.html" title="">waved off</a> by Mr. Trump, who wanted to negotiate an agreement with Tehran instead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump, in his Time interview, said he did not stop Israel’s attack.</p><p>“But I didn’t make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack. I hope we can,” he said. “It’s possible we’ll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An Iranian drone was part of a military parade this month in Tehran.

It has amassed enough to build several bombs if it chooses to weaponize, according to the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p>Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and the I.A.E.A. has said it has not found signs of weaponization.</p><p>If its nuclear facilities are attacked, Iran has said it would retaliate fiercely and would consider leaving the U.N. Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Iran’s economy and the future of its 90 million people are also on the line.</p><p>Years of sanctions have created chronic inflation — exacerbated by economic mismanagement and corruption. Now, many Iranians say they feel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/04/world/middleeast/iran-economy.html" title="">trapped in a downward spiral</a> and hope that a U.S.-Iran deal would help.</p><h2 id="link-6246f54f">What happened in previous talks?</h2><p>The first round of nuclear talks was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/world/middleeast/us-iran-nuclear-talks.html" title="">in Oman</a> two weeks ago, followed by a second round in Rome last weekend.</p><p>Both sides have said the negotiations have been constructive and that they were moving in the right direction.</p><p>Iranian officials have said they are willing to reduce enrichment levels to those specified in the 2015 nuclear agreement with the Obama administration — 3.67 percent — around the level needed to produce fuel for nuclear power plants.</p><h2 id="link-3f8e9aad">What are the sticking points?</h2><p>The question of whether to allow Iran to continue enriching uranium has divided Mr. Trump’s advisers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Witkoff has described a possible agreement that would allow Iran to enrich uranium at the low levels needed to produce fuel for energy, along with monitoring.</p><p>But in a podcast interview this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that Iran could have a civilian nuclear program without enriching uranium domestically — by importing enriched uranium, as other countries do.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media"

seeking a total dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program, a position Iran has deemed a nonstarter.</p><p>Iran invited the United States to invest in its nuclear program and help build 19 more nuclear reactors as an extra measure of security, according to Mr. Araghchi, the foreign minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The trillion-dollar opportunity that our economy presents may be open to U.S. enterprises,” Mr. Araghchi said in a speech he shared on social media. “This includes companies which can help us generate clean electricity from non-hydrocarbon sources.”</p><p>Agreeing to limits on how much enriched uranium Iran can possess and to what level it can enrich exposes Mr. Trump to criticism that he is only replicating the key elements of the Obama-era nuclear agreement.</p><p>Analysts say some possible measures to improve on the old deal could include more stringent monitoring of Iran’s nuclear activities, joint ventures to run the nuclear facilities and making Iran’s guarantees permanent.</p><h2 id="link-31299e01">How did we get here?</h2><p>The two sides came into the negotiations with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/world/middleeast/iran-trump-nuclear-talks.html" title="">deep distrust</a>.</p><p>The previous deal between Iran and the United States and other world powers was called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.</p><p>It put measures in place to prevent Iran from weaponizing its nuclear program by capping enrichment of uranium at 3.5 percent, transferring stockpiles of enriched uranium to Russia and allowing monitoring cameras and inspections by the I.A.E.A.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>European companies pulled out of Iran, and banks stopped working with Iran, fearing U.S. sanctions.</p><p>About a year after the deal was reached, Iran, not seeing any financial benefits, moved away from its obligations and increased its levels uranium enrichment, gradually reaching 60 percent.</p><h2 id="link-29e3a6d9">What comes next?</h2><p>So far, there appears to be political will on both sides to reach a new deal.</p><p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who had barred negotiating with Mr. Trump in the past, authorized the talks and said the negotiating team has his support.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div
