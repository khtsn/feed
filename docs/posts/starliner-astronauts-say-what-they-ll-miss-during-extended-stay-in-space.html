Absolutely not. Not — never entered my mind. I don’t think Suni’s either until you mentioned it.” “Earlier, you talked about watching Starliner go home. I’m just curious if you can go more into the emotions you are feeling when it ultimately returns safely. Was there any disappointment that you weren’t on it?” “To be honest with you, I was so happy it got home with no problems. I was — we saw it fly away and then we all got up. The whole crew got up at whatever, 3 in the morning. And we had it up on our iPads watching it land.” “It’s a very risky business, and things do not always turn out the way you want. Before we launched, we said we’re going to find things. That is the nature of test. Every single test flight, especially a first flight of a spacecraft or an aircraft that has ever occurred, has found issues that things that you just cannot think about — 90 percent of our training is preparing for the unexpected.”</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS2/13ASTRONAUTS2-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore expressed support for NASA and Boeing, following the decision for them to remain in orbit, while the troubled spacecraft they rode to the International Space Station returned to Earth uncrewed.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>NASA Video</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katrina-miller"><img alt="Katrina Miller" title="Katrina Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/15/multimedia/author-katrina-miller/author-katrina-miller-thumbLarge.png"/></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang"><img alt="Kenneth Chang" title="Kenneth Chang" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/multimedia/author-kenneth-chang/author-kenneth-chang-thumbLarge-v3.png"/></a></p></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-09-13T20:11:47-04:00"><span>Sept. 13, 2024</span><span>Updated <span>8:11 p.m. ET</span></span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Nineteen astronauts across three spacecraft are currently in orbit around Earth — a record in the history of human spaceflight. Two of them, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore of NASA, were not originally scheduled to be up there at this time.</p><p>But neither seems perturbed by that. The two astronauts expressed staunch support for NASA and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/business/boeing-starliner-nasa-spacex.html" title="">Boeing, the company</a> whose troubled spacecraft <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/science/boeing-starliner-space-station-docking.html" title="">they rode to the International Space Station in June</a>, before it returned to the surface uncrewed last week.</p><p>“This is my happy place,” Ms. Williams said at a news conference from the space station on Friday. “I love being up here in space. It’s just fun, you know?”</p><p>Mr. Wilmore said he was not disappointed by NASA or Boeing or the decisions that led to their stay in orbit, which was originally announced as eight days in length but will now last until next year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Let down?” Mr. Wilmore said. “Absolutely not. Never entered my mind.”</p><p>In June, Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore launched to space on a test flight of Boeing’s Starliner. The vehicle was to be a second commercial option for NASA to send people to and from the International Space Station.</p><p>The spacecraft had suffered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/science/boeing-starliner-spaceflight.html" title="">a series of technical hiccups</a> across years of testing, including software errors, a faulty parachute system and a helium leak in the propulsion system used to maneuver the capsule in space. During the latest test flight, the first with astronauts aboard, more helium leaks sprang up once Starliner got to orbit.</p><p>After months of analysis, NASA officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html" title="">announced in August</a> that Starliner would be heading back to Earth uncrewed. The pair of astronauts watched from the space station’s cupola as their ship departed without them.</p><p>“I was so happy it got home,” Ms. Williams said, adding that she felt a sense of relief, rather than disappointment, when it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/science/boeing-starliner-nasa-space-station.html" title="">landed successfully</a> in New Mexico last Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore are now expected to return to Earth in February on a SpaceX Crew Dragon. By that point, the duo will have been in space for eight months — though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/science/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronauts.html" title="">NASA objects to calling them “stranded.”</a></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS/13ASTRONAUTS-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS/13ASTRONAUTS-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS/13ASTRONAUTS-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Twelve NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts crowded together aboard the International Space Station." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS/13ASTRONAUTS-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS/13ASTRONAUTS-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS/13ASTRONAUTS-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/13/science/13ASTRONAUTS/13ASTRONAUTS-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="341"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Williams, left, in red, and Mr. Wilmore, in green, are among 10 other crew members currently on the International Space Station, and 19 total people in orbit around Earth, a record.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In the news conference on Friday, the two astronauts shared some of the now-thwarted plans they had for the fall and winter.</p><p>“We always miss our families,” Ms. Williams said, mentioning her mother, husband, two dogs and friends. Ms. Williams, who hails from Massachusetts, said that she would miss New England’s apple-picking season amid the red and yellow hues of autumn, but hoped to take pictures of it from space.</p><p>Mr. Wilmore, who has a wife and two children back on Earth, will miss most of his younger daughter’s senior year of high school and his elder daughter’s sophomore year in college.</p><p>One thing they won’t miss is casting their votes in the November presidential election: Texas allows NASA astronauts to vote from space, and the ballots should arrive at the space station in a couple of weeks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore are not the only astronauts to have had their stay in orbit unexpectedly extended by months.</p><p>A year and a half ago, a radiator on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft docked at the space station sprang a leak. Frank Rubio, a NASA astronaut who launched to the space station on that vehicle, and two Russian astronauts suddenly did not have a ride home.</p><p>As with Starliner, engineers analyzed whether the Soyuz was safe enough to take the three back to Earth.</p><p>“There was no imminent threat to us as a crew, and so we could take the time to analyze, do different testing and really see what different options we could explore for us to get home,” Mr. Rubio recalled in an interview last month.</p><p>Ultimately, Russia launched a replacement Soyuz, and Mr. Rubio’s six-month stay was extended to more than a year. He let his wife and children know in a phone call. “It was challenging,” he said. “You’re missing six extra months of events, right? So whether that’s birthdays, anniversaries or just special moments, it’s certainly a challenge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Rubio now holds the record for the longest single stay in space by an American astronaut: 371 days.</p><p>“Butch and Suni have exhibited the exact same positive attributes that I tried to do,” he said. “Positive attitude. Try to contribute to the work. Focus on the mission.”</p><p>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore seem to be settling into their extended mission, which includes daily exercise to combat the effects of living in space and additional duties as full members of the space station’s crew. (Both have had previous stays on the outpost.)</p><p>Ms. Williams is also keeping a weekly recap journal, which she sends regularly to loved ones back home. She views the opportunity for introspection in space as a silver lining.</p><p>“It really is difficult for me to imagine people on Earth not getting along,” she said. “It’s the one planet we have, and we should all really be happy that we’re there together because that’s it. That’s our place.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Katrina Miller is a science reporter for The Times based in Chicago.
