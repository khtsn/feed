Under the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/middleeast/gaza-arab-leaders-meeting.html" title="">Arab plan</a>, Gaza would be run by Palestinian technocrats within a wider Palestinian state. By one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-postwar-plan.html" title="">Israeli proposal</a>, Israel would cede some control to Palestinians but block Palestinian statehood. By <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers.html" title="">another</a>, Israel would occupy the entire territory.</p><p>Since the opening weeks of the war in Gaza, politicians, diplomats and analysts have made scores of proposals for how it might end, and who should subsequently govern the territory. Those proposals grew in number and relevance after the sealing of a cease-fire in January, increasing the need for clear postwar plans. And when Mr. Trump proposed to forcibly transfer the population later that month, it fueled a push across the Middle East to find an alternative.</p><p>The problem? Each plan contains something unacceptable to either Israel or Hamas, or to the Arab countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia who some hope will fund and partially oversee Gaza’s future.</p><p>“The devil is in the details, and none of the details in these plans make any sense,” said Thomas R. Nides, a former United States ambassador to Israel. “Israel and Hamas have fundamentally opposed positions, while parts of the Arab plan are unacceptable to Israel, and vice versa. I’m all for people suggesting new ideas, but it is very hard for anyone to find common ground unless the dynamics change significantly.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The central challenge is that Israel wants a Hamas-free Gaza whereas the group still seeks to retain its military wing, which led the October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the war.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hamas militants standing in front of crowds during the handover of Israeli hostages to Red Cross officials in Gaza in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s plan would satisfy many Israelis, but it is unacceptable both to Hamas and to the Arab partners of the United States, who want to avoid a process that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/middleeast/international-law-trump-gaza.html" title="">international lawyers say</a> would amount to a war crime.</p><p>The Arab alternative — which was announced last week in Egypt — would allow Palestinians to stay in Gaza, while transferring power to a technocratic Palestinian government. But it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/world/middleeast/gaza-arab-leaders-plan.html" title="">hazy about how exactly Hamas would be removed from power</a>, and it was conditional on the creation of a Palestinian state, which a majority of Israelis oppose.</p><p>The upshot is that, despite the flurry of proposals since January, Israelis and Palestinians are no closer to an agreement about Gaza’s future than they were at the start of the year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In turn, that raises the risks of renewed war.</p><p>The cease-fire agreed to in January was technically meant to last just six weeks, a period that elapsed at the start of March. For now, both sides are maintaining an informal truce while they continue negotiations — mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States — for a formal extension.</p><p>But that goal seems distant because Hamas wants Israel to accept a postwar plan before releasing more hostages, whereas Israel wants more hostages released without an agreement over Gaza’s future. While some Israelis could accept any deal that secures the return of 59 hostages still held in Gaza, of which 24 are said to be alive, key members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government would not.</p><p>In a sign of the deep divides between the sides, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/middleeast/israel-electricity-gaza.html" title="">cut off power</a> to a desalination plant in Gaza on Sunday — the last remaining place in the territory that still received Israeli electricity. The move was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Hamas into backing down, and followed Israel’s decision last week to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-israel.html" title="">suspend humanitarian supplies</a> to the enclave. </p><p>Israeli troops also failed to withdraw from the Egypt-Gaza border over the weekend, breaking a condition of the initial truce.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>For now, some officials are attempting to project a sense of momentum.</p><p>A Hamas delegation visited Egypt over the weekend to discuss Gaza’s future. An Israeli delegation was set to arrive in Qatar on Monday for further mediation. And on Sunday night, Israeli networks broadcast interviews with Adam Boehler, an American envoy, in which he reported “some progress” from a “baby-steps perspective.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adam Boehler, a U.S. envoy, last week in Washington.

Israel and the United States have both called for Hamas to disarm — most recently on Monday, when Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Mideast envoy, said the group’s disarmament and exile was a precondition for peace talks.</p><p>But the Hamas movement has distanced itself from Mr. Abu Marzouq’s remarks and said they had been taken out of context.</p><p>The longer the impasse lasts without any hostages being released, the likelier it is that Israel will return to battle, according to Israeli analysts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Absent a breakthrough, Israel would either have to accept Hamas’s long-term presence — an outcome that is unacceptable to many ministers in the Israeli government — or return to war to force Hamas’s hand, said Ofer Shelah, a former lawmaker and a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a research group in Tel Aviv.</p><p>“Given the current situation, we are on a path leading to an Israeli occupation of Gaza, making Israel responsible for the fate of two million people,” Mr. Shelah said. That would have lasting consequences not only for the Palestinians in Gaza, he said, but also for Israel itself, which would probably get bogged down in a costly war of attrition in order to maintain its control of the territory.</p><p>Lia Lapidot<!-- -->, <!-- -->Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> and <!-- -->Amelia Nierenberg<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patrick Kingsley is The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, leading coverage of Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-kingsley">More about Patrick Kingsley</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>America’s Role:</strong> Among supporters and detractors alike, President Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/trump-foreign-policy-voters.html">upended old notions about the United States as a global leader</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stephen Bannon vs. Elon Musk:</strong> President Trump has made clear he wants to keep both men and their allies within his movement, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/us/politics/stephen-bannon-elon-musk-maga.html">the tensions are growing</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Schools Brace for Trump:</strong> The Trump Administration’s abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University cast a pall over at least nine other campuses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/columbia-trump-colleges-antisemitism.html">worried they could be next</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ukraine’s Access to Satellite Imagery:</strong> A Pentagon agency said that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/us-ukraine-satellite-imagery.html">“temporarily suspended” the sharing of satellite imagery</a> with Ukraine in accordance with orders from President Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trump’s Contradictions: </strong>Trump’s shifting positions and outright lies have presented the American public with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/politics/trump-third-term-gaza-contradictions.html">dueling narratives at every turn</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Report on the Trump Administration</strong></p><p>Hundreds of readers asked about our coverage of the president.
