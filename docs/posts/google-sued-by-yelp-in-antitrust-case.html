Yelp <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/yelp-v-google/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claims</a> that Google used its dominance as a general, or all-purpose, search engine to gain an unfair advantage in local search services. Yelp is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an order for Google to stop its anticompetitive practices in a jury trial.</p><p>A longtime critic of Google, Yelp has frequently complained about how the search giant treats other companies in its results. But it is the first time the San Francisco company has sued Google, despite years of protests to regulators around the world.</p><p>“This is a watershed moment,” Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview. “This is the time to have the conversation, this is the time to correct past wrongs.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yelp is leaning on a ruling from Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">that said Google had abused its power</a> over online search. The Justice Department and states had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/technology/google-monopoly-justice-dept-trial.html" title="">sued Google, accusing it</a> of illegally cementing its dominance by paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars a year to automatically steer users to Google’s search engine on their smartphones and web browsers.</p><p>The Justice Department has considered asking Judge Mehta to break Google up, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html" title="">The New York Times has reported</a>. But there will be another round of hearings to determine remedies in the case, starting in September. Google has said it will appeal the ruling.</p><p>While Yelp may be the first company to bring a case against Google after Judge Mehta’s ruling, it might not be the last. The decision offered a legal framework for other companies that claim they have been strong-armed by Google.</p><p>Aaron Schur, Yelp’s general counsel, said in an interview that the company’s arguments about Google were not unique to Yelp and that he does not “think it will be the last” case of this kind.</p><p>Google places its own results on local businesses above Yelp’s when people look for a nearby restaurant or hair salon, for example, often presenting a Google map near the top of the results page and forcing Yelp and others to compete for space below.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Yelp has been one of the tech industry’s most vocal critics of Google since 2010, the year after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/20/yelp-walks-away-from-google-deal-and-half-a-billion-dollars/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly rejected Google’s $500 million offer</a> to acquire it. The two companies competed to offer users reviews on businesses and services like plumbers and cafes, but Yelp repeatedly complained to regulators that Google was suppressing its content.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge Amit P.

Last year, Yelp <a href="https://www.yelp-press.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Investments-in-Product-Led-Strategy-Drove-Yelps-Strong-2023-Results/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had $1.34 billion</a> in revenue, while Alphabet, Google’s parent, <a href="https://abc.xyz/assets/43/44/675b83d7455885c4615d848d52a4/goog-10-k-2023.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded $307 billion</a>.</p><p>He added that he believed it was the government’s job to enforce monopoly laws against the search giant, a message that Yelp repeatedly delivered.</p><p>With Google’s recent loss, “the winds on antitrust have shifted dramatically,” Mr. Stoppelman said.</p><p>Yelp filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, where a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/technology/epic-games-google-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">jury last year found Google liable for strong-arming Epic Games</a> and other app developers with stringent fees and rules on the Android mobile operating system.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“This is a case about Google, the largest information gatekeeper in existence, abandoning its stated mission to deliver the best information available to its consumers and instead forcing its own low-quality local search content on them,” Yelp said in its legal filing.</p><p>Yelp added that when Google prioritizes its own results, it “starves competitors of the traffic and revenues that would allow them to achieve scale and pose a competitive constraint on Google’s conduct.” </p><p>The company said Google has leveraged its leading position in search to monopolize local search services and the local search ad market. It is suing Google under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, a U.S. antitrust law from 1890.</p><p>In the filing, Yelp said that “Google took Yelp’s data, used it for its own competing property to siphon users away from Yelp and profited.”</p><p>The claim dates back to when the companies had a two-year partnership starting in 2005. Yelp did not renew the deal for fear that Google would build a competing local search product, and it did.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Years later, in 2015, Yelp said that Google adjusted its search algorithm in a way that sent less traffic to Yelp, which experienced its first yearly decline in traffic as a result. Since then, the company said, “Google’s self-preferencing and gatekeeping has resulted in stagnant or diminished traffic to Yelp.”</p><p>Now, Yelp says, Google promotes its own services over competitors in all so-called vertical markets. This includes searches on topics like shopping and travel, where companies like eBay and Expedia compete with Google. Besides hurting the rivals’ businesses, Yelp argues that it also harms consumers.</p><p>Yelp, an ad-supported business, said that Google’s conduct undermined its ability to compete for advertisers, who want to reach the most users, and allowed Google to raise ad prices.</p><p>“Google’s local search results are on average shorter, more prone to error, less subject to quality control, and less likely to result in user engagement than Yelp’s local search results,” the company said in its complaint.</p><p>David McCabe<!-- --> and <!-- -->Cecilia Kang<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-11"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nico Grant reports on Alphabet’s Google and YouTube as well as the corporate culture of Silicon Valley.
