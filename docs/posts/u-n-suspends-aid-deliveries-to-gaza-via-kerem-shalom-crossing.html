In January, Israel accused a dozen of the agency’s employees of participating in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks that set off the war in Gaza, leading the agency to fire them. A U.N. investigation later found that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/world/middleeast/unrwa-israel-hamas-report.html" title="">Israel had not provided evidence</a> to back up its claims that many UNRWA employees had ties to Hamas.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In October, Israel’s parliament <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-ban-gaza.html" title="">passed two laws</a> barring UNRWA operations in the country, a move that could create further logistical challenges for the agency’s work in Gaza. Those laws are set to go into effect early next year.</p><p>The decision to stop UNRWA aid shipments was made after armed gangs robbed a group of aid trucks that entered Gaza on Saturday, a hijacking that came after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html" title="">a larger convoy was looted at gunpoint</a> on Nov. 16, Mr. Lazzarini said.</p><p>Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said the southern part of the territory had seen “a huge increase in looting and in criminal activity in recent months.”</p><p>“Even when we are able to collect aid from the border, it never makes it to our warehouses in Khan Younis,” Ms. Wateridge said, referring to a city in southern Gaza that is a hub for relief distribution. “If you are lucky then some days you might come back with half a truck of supplies, but you started with anything from five trucks or 12 trucks or 100 trucks.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>She said the agency believed some of the looting was driven not by organized crime but by desperation among the more than two million Palestinians living in the territory.</p><p>Ahmed Saleh, 44, a civil servant with the Palestinian Authority, the West Bank-based rival to Hamas, said aid restrictions and looting had left people in his neighborhood of Gaza City with few options.</p><p>“Most of the items, especially food, have disappeared. It is bread that we all fight for now,” said Mr. Saleh, adding that only one bakery was still operating in his neighborhood. “I line up for hours along with hundreds of starving people — men, women and children.”</p><p>Gaza has teetered on the edge of famine for almost a year. Israel, which controls Gaza’s borders, has imposed fluctuating restrictions on the entry of food, water, medicine and other goods since the war against Hamas began more than a year ago. It recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">banned the import of nearly all commercial goods</a>, saying Hamas was benefiting from their sale.</p><p>Last month, the International Criminal Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/icc-netanyahu-israel-gaza-war.html" title="">issued arrest warrants</a> for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister, saying they had “intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity.” The warrants drew a furious response from Mr. Netanyahu and from Israelis across the political spectrum, some of whom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/middleeast/icc-netanyahu-israel-gaza-war.html" title="">accused the court</a> of antisemitism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-yaalon.html" title="">Moshe Yaalon</a>, a former Israeli defense minister who has become a critic of Mr. Netanyahu, said he believed Israel was committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing in Gaza.</p><p>The Biden administration, while generally supporting Mr. Netanyahu’s war aims, has criticized Israel for the lack of aid entering Gaza. In October, the United States threatened to withhold military aid to Israel if more goods did not enter Gaza within 30 days and demanded that at least 350 aid trucks enter each day.</p><p>Israel failed to meet that goal, but the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">did not follow through</a> on its threat to cut off military support.</p><p>Abu Bakr Bashir<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
