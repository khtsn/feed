Kennedy Jr. to be the United States’ next health secretary, released a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Z5Ibcyy23wbMBo1hFOwd2sospbvt9eZ3Ors6qYLm2g/edit?pli=1&amp;tab=t.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public letter</a> on Monday warning that his “unfounded, fringe beliefs could significantly undermine public health practices across the country and around the world.”</p><p>The coalition, calling itself “Defend Public Health,” includes faculty members from some of the U.S.’s leading academic institutions, including public health schools at Yale and Havard. Its leaders said they had gathered 700 signatures on the public letter and had generated <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/7f9f33839a36bbba12e28d0c2fa07062e391864a?source=direct_link&amp;" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3,500 individual letters</a> urging senators to reject Mr. Kennedy, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>“Mr. Kennedy is unqualified to lead the nation’s health department with a budget of over $1.6 trillion and over 80,000 employees,” the public letter states. “He has little to no relevant administrative, policy or health experience or expertise that would prepare him to oversee the work of critical public health agencies.”</p><p>Over the past several weeks, Mr. Kennedy has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/politics/rfk-jr-senate-republicans.html" title="">made the rounds on Capitol Hill</a>, paying courtesy calls to senators who will consider his nomination. His confirmation is not assured, with some Republicans, including Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, having said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" title="">Mr. Kennedy’s vaccine skepticism</a> gives them pause.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The letter published on Monday is only the latest public push by Kennedy opponents. <a href="https://committeetoprotect.org/RFK-ACTION/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A separate group</a>, the Committee to Protect Health Care, said last week that it had gathered more than 15,000 signatures on <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5076993-doctors-oppose-kennedy-nomination/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a letter</a> opposing Mr. Kennedy.</p><p>But Kennedy allies in the medical field are also mobilizing.
