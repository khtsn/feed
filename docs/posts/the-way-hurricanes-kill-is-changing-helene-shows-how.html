The house was hundreds of miles from any coastline.</p><p>On the morning of Sept. 27, a nearby river overflowed, and catastrophe came quickly. Floodwaters rushed toward the couple and the children — Felix, 9, and Lucas, 7. In a frantic effort to escape, all four lost their lives.</p><p>Their deaths represent only a small fraction of Helene’s terrible toll. The storm has killed more than 200 people, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone to strike the mainland United States since 2005.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Over the last three months, The New York Times collected data on Helene’s deaths from county coroners and state officials, and interviewed family members.</p><p>The findings revealed that rain, which led to flooding and landslides, was the most deadly part of the storm, followed by wind, which toppled trees. And they showed that most of the deaths happened in counties where the risk of hurricane fatalities had been considered low, according to data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="helene-deaths-map" data-id="100000009889991" data-source-id="100000009889991"><div slug="helene-deaths-map" data-sourceid="100000009889991" id="embed-id-100000009889991">

And at least 17 people died in Tennessee, including six who had been working at a plastics factory in the town of Erwin, just across the border. Search and rescue teams worked to recover the remains of victims who may have been swept across state lines by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/helene-north-carolina-photos-video.html" title="">floods and landslides</a>.</p><p>In Green Mountain, where Ms. Wisely and Mr. Petrucci lived with her two boys, the threat did not seem severe at first, said Lance Wisely, Ms. Wisely’s former husband and the boys’ father.</p><p>But when the nearby North Toe River burst from its banks and the water began to rise, neighbors saw Ms. Wisely and Mr. Petrucci put the children in the car in an attempt to flee, Mr. Wisely said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>A rush of water carried them all away. All four were buried together on Nov. 9, the same day that the couple were meant to be married. “I wish that I could have protected them from this,” Mr. Wisely said.</p><p>National Hurricane Center data suggests that the rain associated with major storms has become more deadly than storm surge, partly because storm surge preparation has improved in coastal areas, said Michael Brennan, the center’s director. Hurricanes also tend to be wetter in a warming world, which can lead to more freshwater flooding. Climate change could make flooding deaths <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/climate/hurricane-helene-climate-change.html" title="">even more common</a>.</p><h2 id="link-20a68805">Falling trees in Georgia</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In Atlanta, workers cleared a tree that fell during Helene.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erik S Lesser/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In Georgia, the main cause of death was not flooding but wind.</p><p>At least three dozen people died in the state, mostly because of trees toppling onto homes and vehicles, according to reports from officials. Helene entered Georgia as a hurricane but left as a tropical storm, with winds around 70 miles per hour.</p><p>Many residents had not been prepared for such strong gusts so far inland.</p><p>In Thomson, Ga., a small city west of Augusta known for its flowering Camellia plants, Mary Ann Jones stayed in the two-bedroom mobile home she shared with her daughter, Kobe Williams, and her 1-month-old twin grandsons, Khyzier and Khazmir.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Shortly before sunrise on Sept. 27, Ms. Jones, 55, heard a whoosh of wind. Suddenly, she saw tree branches extending from her daughter’s bedroom. She screamed out for her daughter, but there was no answer.</p><p>When the emergency responders arrived, they told Ms. Jones that her daughter and grandsons were dead.</p><p>“Everything in the house reminds me of my daughter,” she said. Ms. Williams delighted in her sons, her mother said, and insisted on dressing them differently so that each could grow into his own person.</p><p>Unlike storm surges, falling trees can be difficult to predict and even more difficult to evade, Dr. Brennan said. “It’s a different type of problem that we need to think about.”</p><h2 id="link-313fbd52">A fatal surge in Florida</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Damage from Hurricane Helene in Keaton Beach, Fla.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Zack Wittman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Florida, by contrast, confronted a familiar threat.

Still, at least 21 people died in Florida, mostly from the storm surge.</p><p>As Helene approached the Big Bend region of the state, Marjorie Havard, 79, told her older sister on the phone that she thought she would be safe in her home about 200 miles south in St. Pete Beach.</p><p>The sister, Marcia Napier, 81, said she had urged Ms. Havard to join her farther south, in Venice, “but she said, ‘Oh, I’m just going to ride this one out.’”</p><p>The next morning, Ms. Napier called her sister over and over again.

S.C., left their home for a cardiology appointment.

Because of Helene, the traffic lights were not working.</p><p>Ms. Padillo, 60, treated it as a four-way stop, but another vehicle did not. Their Toyota Camry was struck by a sport utility vehicle, Ms. Padillo said, killing both her mother and aunt.</p><p>Ms. Padillo was hurt, too.
