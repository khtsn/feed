The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-deportations-venezuelans-el-salvador.html?" title="">court’s latest order</a>, which came around 1 a.m. on Saturday, blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas hours after the American Civil Liberties Union said the Trump administration was preparing to expel them without due process.</p><p>At times, the Trump administration has been accused of disregarding judicial orders as it proceeds with its immigration policies and deportation efforts, deepening legal scholars’ concern that the country could be facing a constitutional crisis.</p><p>Here is a timeline:</p><p><strong>March 14:</strong> The Trump administration issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive order</a> invoking the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/21" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alien Enemies Act</a>, but the order was not immediately made public. The proclamation said that the government was targeting the violent Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua, which it said was threatening an invasion of the United States. The Alien Enemies Act allows the government to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-8/clause-11%E2%80%9314/enemy-aliens" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detain and expel immigrants</a> age 14 or older without a court hearing when the United States is invaded or at war. It is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-alien-enemies-act-history.html" title="">fourth time</a> the law has been invoked in American history.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p><strong>March 15:</strong> Fearing that the Trump administration was preparing to immediately expel Venezuelans in custody without hearings, the A.C.L.U. filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/j-g-g-v-trump?document=COMPLAINT" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> in federal court in Washington seeking to block the president from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/alien-enemies-act-trump.html" title="">invoking</a> the law. The same day, the administration published the executive order. In a hastily scheduled virtual hearing, a federal judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg, was told by the A.C.L.U. that planes were leaving the United States with Venezuelans. He ordered the government not to deport anyone under the law and to return any planes that had already taken off, “however that’s accomplished.”</p><p><strong>March 16</strong>: On social media,<strong> </strong>El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, published a video of men being led off a plane in handcuffs and taken into a prison in his country. Mr. Bukele posted an article about Judge Boasberg’s order and wrote, “Oopsie… Too late.” The Trump administration insisted it did not violate Judge Boasberg’s order. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement that federal courts “have no jurisdiction” over the president’s handling of foreign affairs.</p><p><strong>March 17: </strong>Judge Boasberg grilled a Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/trump-deportation-flights-hearing.html" title="">lawyer on whether</a> the government had defied his orders. The lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, refused to answer specific questions but maintained that the government had complied. Mr. Kambli suggested that the government was following the judge’s written order, which did not include the demand that any planes already in the air return. “Apparently my oral orders don’t appear to carry much weight,” Judge Boasberg said, appearing frustrated. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/timeline-trump-deportation-flights-el-salvador.html" title="">New York Times review</a> of flight data found that three planes carrying more than 200 migrants continued to El Salvador and that none landed before the judge’s order. Two were already in flight, and one had not yet left American soil until after the judge’s written order was published online.</p><p><strong>March 26: </strong>A federal appeals court kept Judge Boasberg’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/trump-deportations-flight-block-alien-enemies-act.html" title="">block on the Alien Enemies Act in place</a>, denying an appeal by the Trump administration. The vote, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was 2 to 1. Judge Karen L. Henderson wrote that the government had not shown a “likelihood of success on the merits.”</p><p><strong>March 28: </strong>Judge<strong> </strong>Boasberg extended his block on the Alien Enemies Act for another two weeks.</p><p><strong>April 7: </strong>The Supreme Court said in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/07/us/supreme-court-venezuelan-migrants.html" title="">unsigned, three-page order</a> that the Trump administration could continue to deport Venezuelan migrants, for the time being. It imposed constraints on the administration, saying that detainees must receive notice before they are deported and must be allowed to seek a hearing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>April 16: </strong>Judge Boasberg, still searching for answers about whether his orders were defied in connection to the deportation flights a month earlier, issued a ruling threatening an extraordinary contempt investigation into the Trump administration.</p><p><strong>April 18: </strong>The A.C.L.U. filed court papers in federal court in Washington, saying that Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, had received removal notices. The notices, written in English, did not tell the Venezuelans how to contest their deportation, the filing said. The migrants were put onto buses and told by officers that they would be removed within 24 hours, court papers said. Judge Boasberg held an emergency hearing, but declined to take any action. Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas rejected a request for intervention. The A.C.L.U. also filed an emergency petition to the Supreme Court. (Separately, the appeals court that sits above Boasberg issued a temporary order blocking any contempt proceedings for now.)</p><p><strong>April 19: </strong>At 12:55 a.m., the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order blocking the Trump administration from deporting the Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet facility “until further order of this court.” Two members of the Supreme Court’s six-justice conservative majority, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., dissented. The Venezuelans were returned to the Bluebonnet facility, according to the A.C.L.U. The speed at which the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/us/politics/court-venezuela-deport-protocol.html" title="">typically methodical</a> Supreme Court responded — and the timing of the order’s release in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/19/us/trump-news#supreme-court-orders-in-the-middle-of-the-night-are-rare-these-days" title="">middle of the night</a> — were highly unusual. </p></div></div></section><div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-justice-department">U.S. Justice Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-supreme-court">U.S. Supreme Court</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</strong><strong>:</strong> Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/maryland-el-salvador-senator-van-hollen-abrego-garcia-deportation.html">traveled to El Salvador to press for the release of Abrego Garcia</a>, a state resident mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, which defied a Supreme Court order to retrieve him.</p></li><li><p><strong>Told to Leave:</strong> The Biden administration allowed 900,000 people to use an app to schedule appointments to cross the border.
