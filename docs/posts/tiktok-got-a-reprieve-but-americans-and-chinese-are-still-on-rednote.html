Americans users say they feel welcome, but politically sensitive topics are off limits.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Hello again, from a TikTok refugee. Nihao. Hello. I think I came to Red Note with a sense of rebellion, that if there’s going to be some of our opportunity taken away, then we may as well just go all the way with it. This idea that we’ll just flock back to whatever we’ve had in the past. Because we have no better options. No, we have options. This is the free market showing you what they want. This just happens to be the one where it seems to be the most people were going to. What happened in the past 24, 48 hours was something I would say phenomenal. And it’s never happened before. I made a video after I saw what’s happened on Xiaohongshu, TikTok refugees just flooding in. Our first reaction was — do you have a cat? So “cat tax” means show my pet. OK, well, I have a dog. I can do that. People are talking to each other. Some of them are actually sharing their farm life in America. And that’s really fascinating. People are curious about my artistic style, which is different than traditional Chinese. I posted a video explaining the concept of sweet tea, which everyone was baffled by how much sugar. A lot of people are interested in what it looks like to be a woodworker in the United States. I think there’s a lot of common ground that we share. I can see why that would be potentially limiting. For my case, It doesn’t feel like that. I think I can talk about woodworking and that should be able to be there. I remember even 20 years ago when we don’t have a wall on our internet, people in every country could just actually talk to each other. I just wish that this sweetness and friendliness and this conversation between these two groups of people can just last longer.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/15/world/asia/collage-for-tt-refugees/collage-for-tt-refugees-verticalTwoByThree735-v2.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Hundreds of thousands of self-described TikTok refugees are flocking to Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social media app also known as RedNote.
