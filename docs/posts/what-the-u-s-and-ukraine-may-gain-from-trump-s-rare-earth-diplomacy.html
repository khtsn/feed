The joint venture would reinvest at least some of its revenue to rebuilding Ukraine.</p><p>It <em>doesn’t</em> contain any security guarantees from Washington, something that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had sought. But it also doesn’t contain earlier Trump demands including that Kyiv contribute $500 billion or repay double any future aid from the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Trump has been fixated on snapping up minerals.</strong> He doesn’t just want Ukraine’s resources, which include lithium, titanium and uranium. He’s also interested in getting access to Russia’s geographical wealth, including so-called rare earth elements like neodymium and promethium. (He appears to mistakenly believe that Ukraine has big stores of rare earth minerals as well.)</p><p>“I’d like to buy minerals on Russian land too if we can,” Trump said on Tuesday. “They have very good rare earth.”</p><p><strong>But is Trump overestimating the importance of these minerals?</strong> Rare earth metals have been <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/9/as-trump-talks-up-trade-war-with-china-fears-rise-for-rare-earths-supply" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">touted as critical</a> to producing components like magnets and batteries for high-tech applications. And geopolitical hawks worry that China is by far the world’s biggest supplier of materials like yttrium.</p><p>But Bloomberg Opinion’s Javier Blas argues that they <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-19/trump-s-insistence-ukraine-has-rare-earth-elements-is-wrong" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aren’t as essential</a> as is commonly perceived (a myth that he says was spread in part by Ukraine last year):</p><blockquote><p>At best, the value of all the world’s rare-earth production rounds to $15 billion a year — emphasis on “a year.” That’s equal to the value of just two days of global oil output. Even if Ukraine had gigantic deposits, they wouldn’t be that valuable in geo-economic terms.</p><p>Say that Ukraine was able, as if by magic, to produce 20% of the world’s rare earths. That would equal to about $3 billion annually. To reach the $500 billion mooted by Trump, the US would need to secure 150-plus years of Ukrainian output.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>In other mineral news: Trump ordered the Commerce Department to study <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-to-probe-copper-tariffs-opening-door-to-new-levy-on-metal" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potential tariffs on copper</a>, which could reshape global supply chains.</p></li></ul><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span><strong>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING</strong> </span></h3><p><strong>The House passes a budget focused on tax and spending cuts.</strong> Lawmakers in the lower chamber narrowly approved a bill that calls for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/mike-johnson-budget-resolution-vote.html" title="">$4.5 trillion in tax cuts</a> and $2 trillion in spending reductions. The fine print: If legislators fail to meet the cost-cuts goal, the amount of tax reductions will also shrink. It sets up a path for Republicans to pass a budget along party lines, though Senate G.O.P. lawmakers have different ideas for tackling the issue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><strong>President Trump again reaffirms his support for Elon Musk.</strong> On Truth Social on Wednesday, the president urged his billionaire ally to “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114069904344598839" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">run Elon, run!</a>” despite facing blowback over an emailed directive to federal workers.

What recourse do Paramount shareholders have? Does a settlement raise potential risks to media deals under Trump? And what is a board’s fiduciary responsibility when it comes to settling a lawsuit that a company says is without merit?</p><p><strong>A recap: </strong>Trump sued CBS News for $20 billion, asserting that its “60 Minutes” program deceptively edited an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris to cast her in a more favorable light. Separate, but potentially related: Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount and CBS, is still waiting for regulatory approval for the Paramount-Skydance deal, which is supposed to close in the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/08/2909354/0/en/Skydance-Media-and-Paramount-Global-Sign-Definitive-Agreement-to-Advance-Paramount-as-a-World-Class-Media-and-Technology-Enterprise.html#:~:text=The%20transaction%20is%20anticipated%20to%20close%20in%20the%20first%20half%20of%202025.%C2%A0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">next few months</a>.</p><p>Some Paramount executives believe that settling the suit would clear the way for the merger.</p><p>But the company said any potential settlement was “completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the F.C.C. approval process.” A Paramount spokesman said in a statement: “We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.”</p><p>At CBS News, which is part of Paramount, the settlement talks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/business/media/cbs-news-60-minutes-trump.html" title="">have led to an uproar.</a> Legal experts see Trump’s case <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/business/media/trump-media-lawsuits.html" title="">as weak</a>, and the idea of a potential payout to him has caused deep distress within the storied news network. </p><p><strong>“They are definitely going to get sued if they settle,” </strong>Brian Quinn, a law professor at Boston College, told DealBook, referring to potential shareholder suits against the company. Quinn reiterated a concern shared by some Paramount executives: Any settlement could appear to be a bribe for the Federal Communications Commission to approve its deal with Skydance.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Importantly, board directors and company executives are typically not insured against such lawsuits.</p><p><strong>But those suits aren’t easy to win. </strong>The law generally says courts shouldn’t be in the business of second-guessing business decisions, and legal settlements usually fall within that category, several experts told DealBook.</p><p>Barring any smoking guns, that gives the board some legal leeway, according to Zohar Goshen, a professor at Columbia Law School. “The board,” he said, “can consider not only the direct legal exposure — assessed by the probability of winning or losing — but also the indirect business risks posed by the Trump administration’s stance on the corporation’s activities.”</p><p><strong>But there’s more at play than strictly fiduciary considerations. </strong>Any settlement could create a thorny precedent. Trump’s longstanding animus toward CNN, for example, could complicate any deal maneuvers by its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The media industry has been shrinking and undergoing consolidation as the tech giants continue to eat away at its profit.
