More akin to a typical storm system over the United States, the storm’s energy came from interacting air masses instead of from the rising warm, humid air of the ocean.</p><p>But even without the name, the hazards are the same. It has produced significant impacts on Monday, with life-threatening flash flooding reported in portions of southeastern North Carolina and wind gusts in excess of 60 mph along the coast, forecasters with the National Hurricane Center said Monday afternoon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-1"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/16/multimedia/16wea-tropical-storm-carolinas-gvtf/16wea-tropical-storm-carolinas-gvtf-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">The storm system produced significant impacts on Monday, with life-threatening flash flooding reported in portions of southeastern North Carolina.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Renee Spencer/The Star-News, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Flash flooding was ongoing early Monday afternoon as over half a foot of rain had fallen since midnight across southeastern North Carolina.

Forecasters did not originally expect as much rain for Monday. But by early afternoon, some locations, like Sunny Point, N.C., had already seen nearly 15 inches of rain, the top end of what fell in North Carolina during Debby.</p><p>Carolina Beach, N.C., had seen over 18 inches of rain since midnight, surpassing the 11 inches that fell in the beachfront community during Debby. Forecasters out of Wilmington, N.C., called the likelihood of that amount of rain occurring in only 12 hours a one-in-a-thousand-year event.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Schools in New Hanover County, which was partially under flash flood warning Monday afternoon, dismissed all students early and canceled classes at Carolina Beach Elementary School, which is just a couple blocks from the coast.

Officials in the city of Southport, N.C., which is about 30 miles south of Wilmington, closed the roads to all incoming traffic and told residents to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/zRs9XGLFh3Ee4hZz/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shelter in place</a> at their homes or places of work, according to the city’s Facebook posts.</p><h2 id="link-14a397bf">Key things to know</h2><ul><li><p>Most of the rain will fall near or north of the storm’s center, with widespread totals of four to eight inches and a few areas getting nearly 10 inches of rainfall in North Carolina.</p></li><li><p>The storm system is expected to continue to move slowly inland overnight as rains spread across North Carolina. On Tuesday, the remnants of the storm will move into Virginia, bringing the potential for some flooding rains across the commonwealth into Wednesday morning.</p></li><li><p>As the storm approached land, its winds weakened below tropical-storm-force (39 m.p.h. or greater), prompting the hurricane center to drop the tropical storm warnings that had flanked the coast.</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-9"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="eight-precip-embed" data-id="100000009694112" data-source-id="100000009694112"><div data-sourceid="100000009694112" id="embed-id-100000009694112">
