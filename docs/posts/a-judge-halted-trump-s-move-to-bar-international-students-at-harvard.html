The judge agreed with the university that the government’s decision would cause “immediate and irreparable injury” to the school.</p><p>The order <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/harvard-sues-trump-international-students-garber.html" title="">came in response to a lawsuit that Harvard filed this morning</a>, just a day after it was told that its ability to enroll foreign students was being revoked. The university accused the Trump administration of a “campaign of retribution” for rejecting the government’s demands. </p><p>The administration said Harvard had not complied with a list of demands sent on April 16, which called for the school to provide information on about 7,000 students within 10 business days. In this morning’s lawsuit, Harvard said that it had submitted the required information on April 30.</p><p>Harvard’s president called the ban “unlawful and unwarranted.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/harvard-international-students-trump.html" title="">It would transform the university</a>, where more than a quarter of the students come from other countries. They contribute disproportionately to the university’s revenue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The restraining order was the latest sign that the courts are serving as a rare check on President Trump’s power. But as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-administration-courts-judges-law.html" title="">our legal policy reporter Charlie Savage explained</a>, judicial losses have not necessarily stopped the president’s actions from having an impact.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Volkswagen factory in Zwickau, Germany, last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ingmar Nolting for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7826285d">Trump threatened steep tariffs on the E.U. and Apple</h2><p>Trump, who for the last couple of weeks had focused mostly on his tax bill and his trip to the Middle East, turned his attention back to the global trade system. He threatened today to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-tariffs-eu-apple.html" title="">impose 50 percent tariffs on imports from the E.U.</a> because talks on a trade deal with the bloc “are going nowhere.”</p><p>Trump also went on the offensive against Apple. He demanded that the company begin making iPhones in the U.S. or pay tariffs of at least 25 percent on iPhones made abroad. Our Silicon Valley reporter Tripp Mickle explained why Apple is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/technology/apple-iphone-trump-india-china.html" title="">unlikely to make the change anytime soon</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olena Nehir with her husband, Oleksandr, who was released from Russian captivity on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-136cdc3">Russia and Ukraine began their largest prisoner exchange</h2><p>Ukraine and Russia each returned 390 soldiers and civilians today in the first exchange of the largest prisoner swap of the war.
