The strikes, which included an attempted assassination of a top Hezbollah commander, were the deadliest in Lebanon since 2006, during the last Israel-Hezbollah war.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/23/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah" title="">Here’s the latest</a>.</p><p>The attacks were the latest in a series of attempts by Israel to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-escalating.html" title="">break the resolve of the Iranian-backed militant group</a>. It controls scores of villages across southern Lebanon and has been firing rockets and drones at Israel since last October, in support of its ally, Hamas. But so far, Hezbollah has vowed to continue its attacks: The group fired about 165 rockets and other munitions into Israel today, according to the Israeli military.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli public to expect “complicated days” ahead, as Israel seeks to “change the balance of security” along its northern border with Lebanon. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/us-troops-mideast.html" title="">The Pentagon also said it would send additional U.S. troops</a> to the region because of the rising tensions.</p><p>The bombardments came a day before world leaders were to gather in New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where Israel’s conflicts with both Hezbollah and Hamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/world/middleeast/un-meeting-war-climate.html" title="">are expected to be major topics of debate</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump in Mosinee, Wis., earlier this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Prosecutors will pursue a charge of attempted assassination against the suspect.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saul Martinez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-7919eac6">Suspect in Trump assassination attempt planned for months</h2><p>The 58-year-old man accused of trying to assassinate Donald Trump last week acknowledged in a prewritten note that he had planned the attack, and even predicted his failure, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-routh-hearing.html" title="">according to a new court filing</a>. The suspect, Ryan Routh, left the note inside a box at a friend’s home months ago, indicating that he had been planning the assassination for a long time.</p><p>In court today, prosecutors said they were seeking a charge of attempted assassination, which would carry a maximum possible penalty of life imprisonment.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Administration officials said that national security concerns, not politics, drove the ban.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Qilai Shen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sally Rooney</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ellius Grace for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-1aff095a">Sally Rooney is back with ‘Intermezzo’</h2><p>One of the biggest literary moments of the season is nearly upon us: Sally Rooney’s new novel, “Intermezzo,” will be released tomorrow.</p><p>The book, about two grieving brothers and their experiences with love, is sure to face backlash, just like Rooney’s other wildly popular books — especially among publishing’s smart young crowd. But our critic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/books/review/sally-rooney-intermezzo.html" title="">Dwight Garner writes that the backlash shouldn’t scare you away</a>.

After his recent rave review of Rooted Rotisserie in Baltimore, the spot was suddenly booked out for weeks. His influence has become so profound that it has become known as the “Keith Lee effect.”</p><p>But as his profile has grown, some viewers and members of the food media have questioned his methods and credibility as a critic. Lee has drawn criticism for how he picks restaurants and how he tastes — generally taking just one bite of a takeout dish in his car before declaring a score from 1 to 10.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Roe for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Julia Gartland for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Roberto Cornacchia/Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><h2 id="link-5edae28">A quest to find all the bananas</h2><p>You probably know just one type of banana, the Cavendish: It’s long, yellow and is the world’s most-eaten fruit.
