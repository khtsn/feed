The suspected arsonists fled when they noticed one of the congregants, the authorities said.</p><p>Emergency services were called to the synagogue just after 4 a.m. local time. Nobody else was inside at the time of the fire, which occurred a little over an hour before a planned morning service at the synagogue, the police said. </p><p>The authorities said they were looking for three people believed to be involved.</p><p>The blaze caused significant damage to the building, and one congregant sustained a minor injury on his hand, the police said. Investigators were “working to establish the exact circumstances of the fire, and at this stage believe it was a targeted incident,” the police said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Chris Murray, the officer in charge of the arson and explosives squad at Victoria Police, said at a news conference that the arsonists would be held to account to ensure that congregants could return to their local synagogue and do “what is absolutely Australian, that is to be able to worship without fear.”</p><p>In a statement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said: “I have zero tolerance for antisemitism. It has absolutely no place in Australia.” </p><p>“This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage,” he added.</p><p>Jacinta Allen, the top official for the state of Victoria, said the government could “absolutely identify that this is an act of antisemitism.”</p><p>Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent war in Gaza, Australia has recorded a flurry of incidents targeting Jews and Muslims, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/antisemitic-islamophobic-incidents-australia-israel-war.html" title="">increasing tensions between members of the faiths</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry reported more than 2,000 anti-Jewish incidents in the country between October 2023 and this September.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-moses">More about Claire Moses</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Undersea Surgeons: </strong>In a wireless world, it is easy to forget the cables that snake across the turbulent ocean floor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/30/world/africa/subsea-cables.html">Until they snap</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mexican Cartels Turn to Students:</strong> Cartels are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/americas/mexico-fentanyl-chemistry-students.html">luring university chemistry students in Mexico</a> with big paydays in their quest to build fentanyl empires.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Sinking Arctic Hamlet:</strong> Canada is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/world/americas/canada-arctic-permafrost-thawing.html">losing its permafrost to climate change</a>.
