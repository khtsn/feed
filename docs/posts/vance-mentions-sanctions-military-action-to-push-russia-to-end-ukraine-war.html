    <h1>Vance Mentions Sanctions, Military Action to Push Russia to End Ukraine War</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vice President JD Vance told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that all military and economic options were on the table if Russia did not agree to negotiate in good faith to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>“There are economic tools of leverage, there are, of course, military tools of leverage” available to the United States against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Vance told The Journal in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/vance-wields-threat-of-sanctions-military-action-to-push-putin-into-ukraine-deal-da9c18ac" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview published late Thursday</a>. Mr. Vance is expected to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Munich on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Vance’s comments came after President Trump on Wednesday said that he had begun talks with Mr. Putin to end the war. Mr. Trump also said that it was unlikely that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, and that future NATO membership for the country was not practical.</p><p>Mr. Vance told The Journal that it was too early to talk about specific territorial arrangements or security guarantees for Ukraine. “There are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence,” he said.</p></div></div>
