He was a former editor in chief of The Texas Tribune and held senior roles at the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, as well as a number of board positions.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/sewellchan/status/1913315814863786061" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on Friday afternoon, Mr. Chan described his firing as “hasty, ill-considered and quite frankly baffling.” He said he had learned earlier this week of several staff complaints about his behavior and had offered to meet with the employees.</p><p>He acknowledged three “pointed interactions” in recent weeks with colleagues, but described them as “normal workplace interactions.”</p><p>“This is the same approach I took in leading The Texas Tribune and the Los Angeles Times editorial board and as an editor and reporter at The New York Times,” he said. “The norms at Columbia are apparently very different.”</p><p>Mr. Cobb declined to comment further when contacted by The Times because “it’s a personnel matter.”</p><p>In a separate email to CJR board members on Friday, Mr. Cobb and the board chair, Rebecca Blumenstein, president of editorial at NBC News, said Mr. Chan’s departure was “effective immediately.” The news shocked some members of the board, according to two people familiar with the matter. The board was preparing to convene for a regular meeting next week, which is still scheduled to take place, the people said.</p><p>Mr. Chan’s departure comes at an inopportune time for CJR. The magazine, which has been running under tight budgetary constraints, was beginning a fund-raising campaign, two people familiar with it said. Now, the magazine is without a permanent editor to spearhead that effort.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>On Friday, Ravi Somaiya, a former editor at CJR, wrote <a href="https://www.breakermedia.com/p/inside-sewell-chan-s-horrible-cjr-editorship?_bhlid=481b449c61b0cc8305edbb1af26e51018a34755f&amp;last_resource_guid=Post%3Afa56f01c-0e1b-41a0-ace7-d00dcc4b4788&amp;utm_campaign=inside-sewell-chan-s-horrible-cjr-editorship&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=www.breakermedia.com" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a first-person essay</a> in the Breaker Media newsletter describing a tense workplace relationship with Mr. Chan.
