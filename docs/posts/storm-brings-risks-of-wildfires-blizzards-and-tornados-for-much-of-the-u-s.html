Meteorologists predict that strengthening winds and an influx of warm, moist air from the Gulf will create favorable conditions for severe weather across the South. By Tuesday afternoon and evening, conditions in the region will be ripe for severe storms. Forecasters have warned of damaging gusts, hail and possible tornadoes from eastern Oklahoma through Alabama and far western parts of Florida.</p><p>A Tornado watch was in effect in portions of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said the question is not whether severe storms will occur across the South, but how strong they will be. At a minimum, a line of thunderstorms is expected to develop and sweep through Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on a scale that people typically there see multiple times a year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>There is also a possibility that the storms could also be significantly stronger, as well as include strong tornadoes that may cause damage.</p><p>The most likely scenario is somewhere in between.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-5"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-03-03-bigstorm" data-id="100000010028956" data-source-id="100000010028956"><div slug="2025-03-03-bigstorm" data-sourceid="100000010028956" id="embed-id-100000010028956">

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-109aba73">Here’s what typical, and not, about this system.</h2><p>Mr. Chenard said that what made this storm unusual was the possibility that the pressure, one way to measure a storm’s strength, would drop to near-record-low readings for March. But storms like this one are three-dimensional, and there are ingredients other than just low pressure that can contribute to how they ultimately affect the areas they pass through.</p><p>And, in this case, Mr. Chenard said, the effects may be not really all that unusual for this time of year. There may not be much cold air behind this system, he said, which means it may not bring as much snow as could be expected with other storms. And because the storm is moving so quickly, precipitation won’t linger over one spot for long, which keeps flooding rains and snow from piling up. Still, forecasters like Mr. Chenard don’t want to underplay the risks as the storm intensifies on Tuesday.</p><h2 id="link-1437f5d7">The danger will move east on Wednesday.</h2><p>As the storm continues marching eastward, it will swing rain and thunderstorms through the East Coast. The most likely area for severe storms will be across eastern South Carolina, eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an enhanced risk for these areas, warning of severe thunderstorms capable of producing damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes on Wednesday morning and through Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>On the western side of this strong March storm, cold air could lead to snow in places that received rain the day before — or, in some cases, even hours before.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-14"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="2025-03-03-eastcoastwedsneday" data-id="100000010029528" data-source-id="100000010029528"><div slug="2025-03-03-eastcoastwedsneday" data-sourceid="100000010029528" id="embed-id-100000010029528">
