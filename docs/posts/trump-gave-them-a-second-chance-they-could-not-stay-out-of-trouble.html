Her family quickly navigated a back channel to President Donald J. Trump — the one man who had the power to free her with the stroke of his pen — as he was embarking on an unusual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/politics/trump-pardons.html" title="">clemency spree</a>.</p><p>Adam Katz, a lawyer with links to Mr. Trump’s world, agreed to take on Ms. Camberos’s case after a chance meeting with one of her relatives. Before Ms. Camberos finished her second month in prison, Mr. Katz filed a petition to request a commutation with the Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Justice Department, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>That office is tasked with vetting petitions and recommending deserving applicants to the president. But the office itself had become less important than winning Mr. Trump’s favor directly, fueling a market to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/us/politics/trump-pardons.html" title="">buy access to his advisers</a>. While Ms. Camberos’s family does not appear to have had high-level political ties, they and their allies took several steps that seemed designed to bolster her standing with Mr. Trump’s inner circle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Katz brought the case to Stefan C. Passantino, a lawyer who had been a deputy White House counsel and stayed in touch with people around the president. The White House also heard that the newly elected Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/politics/qanon-trump-greene-lawyers.html" title="">already among Mr. Trump’s favorites</a> and one of Mr. Passantino’s clients, was in favor of seeing Ms. Camberos get relief, according to a person familiar with the process. A spokesman for Ms. Greene did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>And one month after Ms. Camberos’s clemency petition was filed, her brother Andres Camberos made his first federal political donation to a Republican — <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202006199240017866" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$50,000 to Mr. Trump’s 2020 re-election effort</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Adriana Camberos was sentenced to federal prison for her role in a scheme to sell millions of counterfeit bottles of the caffeinated drink 5-hour Energy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the final days of Mr. Trump’s term in 2021, without a recommendation from the Office of the Pardon Attorney, the president <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commuted the sentence of Ms. Camberos</a>, then known as Adriana Shayota, springing her from prison about a year early.</p><p>She did not stay out of trouble for long.</p><p>Soon after her commutation, she and her brother Andres embarked on a new fraud, federal prosecutors in California said. The siblings were charged last year in a complicated scheme: They bought consumer goods from manufacturers at a steep discount, purportedly to sell them in Mexico — a legal practice. Instead, prosecutors said, the siblings sold the goods in the United States at higher prices and then committed bank and mail fraud to cover their tracks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>They have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled to go on trial next month.</p><p>Executive clemency is among the most unilateral unchecked powers of the Oval Office. Presidents are allowed to decide how and to whom to issue commutations, which reduce or eliminate prison sentences, and pardons, which wipe away conviction records.</p><p>According to <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/fsr/article-abstract/33/5/297/117725/Donald-Trump-and-the-Clemency-Process?redirectedFrom=fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an analysis</a> in a law journal focused on criminal justice, only 25 of the nearly 240 clemency grants issued by Mr. Trump were vetted and recommended by the pardon attorney’s office.

The man, who requested anonymity to discuss the continuing case, said he sent a message to Mr. Trump through his campaign website to point out the impact of Mr. Weinstein’s commutation. He said he did not receive a response.</p><p>Nick Muzin, a lobbyist who was paid at least $75,000 to advocate on behalf of Mr. Weinstein for commutation and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/us/politics/trump-pardons.html" title="">played a critical role in securing it</a>, told a Times reporter this month that those who supported the commutation “felt misled.”</p><p>Federal investigators looking into the Camberos siblings have asked at least one witness<strong> </strong>in the case<strong> </strong>about the $50,000 donation from Mr. Camberos to Mr. Trump,<strong> </strong>according to a person familiar with the investigation. It is not known why it may be of interest to prosecutors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. Camberos, 53, had argued in her clemency petition that her ex-husband masterminded the 5-hour Energy scheme without her knowledge. (No one was known to have been harmed by the counterfeit drink.) Lawyers representing her and her brother rejected suggestions that Ms. Camberos had a proclivity toward criminality.</p><p>“For those who know what Adriana has been through, the notion that she is a recidivist is implausible,” the lawyers said in a statement, adding that the siblings “very much look forward to being vindicated at trial.”</p><p>Geoffrey Potter, a lawyer for the company that manufactures 5-hour Energy, disagreed. He negotiated a civil settlement with Ms. Camberos and her now ex-husband Joseph Shayota in 2013.</p><p>“She’s a grifter with a long history of counterfeiting and fraudulently diverting consumer products,” he said. “Her recidivism is not a surprise to me, and shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone.”</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- --> contributed reporting. <!-- -->Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Kenneth P.
