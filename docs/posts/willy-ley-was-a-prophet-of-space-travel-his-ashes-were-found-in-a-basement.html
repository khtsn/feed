Though it would be decades before the first man was launched into orbit, Mr. Ley was convinced from an early age that space travel was within reach.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>As a 20-year-old student in 1926, Mr. Ley wrote his first book, “A Trip Into Space,” which explained to the general public the concept and potential of spaceflight and rocketry. In 1927, he helped establish the “Society for Space Travel,” the purpose of which, he said, was “to spread the thought that the planets were within reach of humanity, if humanity was only willing to struggle a bit for that goal.”</p><p>He recruited a young Wernher von Braun — the rocket and aerospace pioneer — to join the Society, beginning the first of many collaborations between the two men.</p><p>In Berlin in 1930, Mr. Ley introduced a liquid-fuel rocket to a group of aeronautical engineers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wernher von Braun, left, with Willy Ley.

It could climb about 1500 feet and was brought back by parachute,” Mr. Ley recalled in a 1968 article he wrote for The New York Times. “What, the engineers wanted to know, was the aim of all of this? Eventually, I replied, rockets of this type will carry men to the moon.”</p><p>The rise of the Nazi party disturbed Mr. Ley deeply, and in 1935, worried about the weaponization of rockets by the government, he fled Germany. Eventually, he ended up in Queens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In New York, he made a living primarily as a science writer, churning out articles and books, including “Rockets: The Future of Travel Beyond the Stratosphere” in 1944. In it, Mr. Ley reiterated his belief in the possibility of space travel: “I wish to affirm with great seriousness that the rocket to the moon <em>is</em> possible,” he wrote. “Whether it has any practical value is another question and whether the experiment will be made is another story altogether.”</p><p>Jared S. Buss, the author of the 2017 biography “Willy Ley: Prophet of the Space Age,” called Mr. Ley one of the architects of that era — a major player in America’s early attempts at space exploration. “In the late ’50s when Sputnik was launched, he was the person journalists turned to as an expert,” Mr. Buss said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Ley, who fled Germany during the rise of the Nazi party and settled in New York, has a crater on the moon named after him.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bettmann, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 1951, Mr. Ley participated in the first symposium on space travel, said the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the American Museum of Natural History’s Hayden Planetarium.</p><p>That symposium and the annual meetings that followed “led to a series of articles, including many cover stories from 1952 to 1954, that became the public’s first exposure and awareness of a possible future in space,” Dr. Tyson said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In a very real sense, Willy Ley helped introduce the notion of space travel to the American public.</p><p>In a 1952 article in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine he predicted what the first manned spacecraft would look like, almost a decade before it happened:</p><blockquote><p>The voyage of the first spaceship, as I have repeatedly said, will go literally nowhere. It will be a vertical takeoff from base, followed by a tilt in an easterly direction so that the ship will travel along the ellipse around the Earth. The captain will stay “up” until all the service tests have been completed, the observing program carried out, or until everybody aboard is thoroughly bored. Then he’ll land again, trying to make it as close to base as he can.</p></blockquote><p>Nearly nine years later, in April 1961, Yuri Gagarin did just that, becoming the first man in space. Taking off from what is now Kazakhstan, he flew eastward around the earth and landed in the Saratov region of Russia after 108 minutes in orbit.</p><p>As the space race mounted, Mr. Ley continued to publish books and articles that translated complex astrophysics and rocketry concepts for a broader audience. His work was cited by Congress, and many of his then-outlandish predictions — an undersea tunnel between Britain and France, the rise of commercial solar and wind power — have since been realized. Walt Disney hired him as a consultant any time a rocket ship or space ride was being built at Disneyland.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Willy and Olga Ley married in 1941 and lived with their daughters in Queens.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Olga Ley</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>He spent the rest of his life living in Jackson Heights, Queens, with his wife, Olga, and two daughters.

His younger sister, his wife, his daughters and his granddaughter are all deceased, so at first it was difficult for Ms. Nadeau to confirm that the ashes were definitely his.</p><p>But a deeper dive into files of the United States Columbarium, now called Fresh Pond Crematory in Middle Village, N.Y., verified that the identification number on the can, 136874, was indeed a match to Willy Ley.

Margaret A.
