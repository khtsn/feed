Other students and faculty members contemplating her departure were saddened. But there was also cautious optimism that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/katrina-armstrong-columbia-president.html" title="">new interim president, Katrina Armstrong</a>, could better manage a chaotic campus situation that in many ways had become ungovernable for Dr. Shafik.</p><p>As a newcomer to Columbia, Dr. Shafik had limited experience to help her navigate tensions among different factions on campus and manage a pro-Palestinian movement undeterred by suspensions, arrests and locked campus gates. She was criticized by both those who thought she did too much to crack down on protesters and those who thought she did not do enough.</p><p>But Dr. Shafik’s departure still left some students and faculty members with a sense of sadness that the university had become so toxic for her that she felt she had to leave.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Dr. Andrew R. Marks, a member of the executive committee of the University Senate, had broadly supported Dr. Shafik, though he said he disapproved of her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/30/nyregion/columbia-protests-college" title="">calling the police to campus</a> against the Senate’s advice.</p><p>“She was the first woman president of Columbia University and many of us had high hopes for her leadership,” he said.</p><p>For some of those close to her, the move seemed to reflect the practical decision-making of a professional economist who had decided there was little upside in staying, for herself or the university, when she had already faced so much criticism.</p><p>“She’s a consummate professional,” David Greenwald, the co-chair of Columbia’s board of trustees, said in an interview on Wednesday night. “She made the very difficult decision that it was in Columbia’s best interest for it to have a fresh start with a new president.”</p><p>“This was her decision,” said Claire Shipman, the board’s other co-chair, who also stressed that the board had been busily planning for the fall with Dr. Shafik and had not asked her to resign.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But, she added: “We understand it after the year we’ve all experienced and the toll it has taken.”</p><p>The criticisms of Dr. Shafik, who goes by Minouche, sometimes took the form of angry personal threats, the former president wrote in her departure note to the Columbia community.</p><p>“It has been distressing — for the community, for me as president and on a personal level — to find myself, colleagues and students the subject of threats and abuse,” she wrote. </p><p>Steven Min, 22, a junior who was on campus Thursday morning, said that during the spring semester he noticed in uptick in hate speech toward the former president on an anonymous posting platform for students called Sidechat.</p><p>“It was like she was stuck to the road with a car driving toward her,” he added. “She was put on the spot and harassed.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Steven Min, an undergraduate student, said he had noticed an increase in personal attacks on Dr. Shafik online.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Dee Delgado for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>Dr. Shafik had told several people that the presence of protesters screaming outside her house in the middle of the night was particularly disturbing to her and her family and was making them lose sleep. Police barricades were placed outside her house to deter protesters from gathering at the end of last semester.</p></div><div><div><p>In her letter to the community on Wednesday, she said she would be moving to a role working for the British foreign secretary under the country’s new prime minister.</p><p>Robert Newton, a Columbia oceanographer who is on the executive committee of Columbia’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, a faculty group focused on academic freedom, said he thought it would have been extremely hard for Dr. Shafik to stay in the position this year, given what happened last year. One major blow was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/nyregion/president-shafik-columbia-faculty-vote.html" title="">no-confidence vote</a> in her by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p><p>“I think she made some major mistakes early on, and she could never quite recover from them,” he said.</p><p>But he and others added that it was not an inevitability that the campus had become so chaotic and unmanageable by last semester’s end. Other universities and their leaders had made it through the tensions sparked by the Israel-Hamas war more smoothly.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“There’s been a long history of protest at American college campuses,” Mr. Newton said. “It hasn’t made them ungovernable. I mean, it’s difficult to manage a community which is sharply divided. But if you allow protest, if you choose not to criminalize civil disobedience — if you do those things, then the process rolls forward.”</p><p>Predictably, perhaps, the people celebrating Dr. Shafik’s departure most openly on Thursday were those at the extremes of the debate over whether Columbia under Dr. Shafik had bowed too far toward those supporting Israel, or toward those who oppose it.</p><p>The Columbia chapter for Students in Justice in Palestine, an anti-Zionist organization that was suspended from campus last fall but continued to organize under a different banner, posted on social media: “After months of chanting ‘Minouche Shafik, you can’t hide,’ she finally got the memo.”</p><p>And <a href="https://x.com/NerdeenKiswani/status/1823925023423259020" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raucous cheers</a> broke out Wednesday night among anti-Zionist demonstrators who were protesting a Kamala Harris campaign event in Harlem when a speaker announced the news of Dr. Shafik’s resignation.</p><p>Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, a Republican who has described Columbia as a hotbed of antisemitism, said in a statement that the resignation was “long overdue.” She described Dr. Shafik as “failing to protect Jewish students and negotiating with pro-Hamas terrorists.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Many at Columbia, weary from months of conflict, hoped that Dr. Armstrong, who is already a proven leader at the university’s medical campus uptown, would be aided by her years of experience at the institution as she starts in her interim presidency.</p><p>“She knows faculty and students,” Brendan O’Flaherty, an economics professor, said. “That helps her.” She also knows how the university works, he added, and “has seen what can go wrong.”</p><p>There was also a broad hope that for everyone’s sake, no matter who sits in the president’s seat, Columbia would weather the tensions on campus better this year.</p><p>“I think we need someone open-minded because it’s such a diverse university, diverse city, so you have to think about every group’s benefits,” said Katherine Chen, 23, a student at the medical center, who felt Dr. Shafik’s decision to have protesters arrested had been too heavy-handed. “You have to demonstrate you’re fair, not preferential toward one group.”</p><p>Rebuilding trust between students and the administration will have to be high on the agenda, said Ainsley Martinez, 22, a master’s student, even if doing so will be difficult.</p><p>“I think some students are at a place where any president isn’t going to be the right pick,” she said, adding that the broader institution also had work to do: “A lot of people are aware that a president is only one part of the coin.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sharon Otterman is a Times reporter covering higher education, public health and other issues facing New York City.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sharon-otterman">More about Sharon Otterman</a></span></p></div><div><p>Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/stephanie-saul">More about Stephanie Saul</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Gaza Cease-Fire Talks:</strong> Ahead of a high-stakes round of negotiations, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/gaza-peace-talks.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-middle-east-crisis&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Article">hopes for a breakthrough were damped</a> after Hamas said it would not attend.
