    <h1>Crucial Week for Trump: New Tariffs and Elections Will Test His Momentum</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“It’s a big race,” Mr. Trump said of the Wisconsin judicial contest on Monday while signing executive orders in the Oval Office. “Wisconsin is a big state politically, and the Supreme Court has a lot to do with elections in Wisconsin.”</p><p>Mr. Trump is also expected to reveal the details of his reciprocal tariff plan on Wednesday. He has labeled it “Liberation Day,” saying the nation will finally break free of past trade relationships that he argues have cheated the United States. Investors, however, are growing more concerned that the tariffs could fuel inflation and slow consumer spending, potentially driving up economic anxieties among voters.</p><p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, brushed off those concerns on Monday.</p><p>“The president will be announcing a tariff plan that will roll back the unfair trade practices that have been ripping off our country for decades,” Ms. Leavitt said. “He’s doing this in the best interest of the American worker. The president has always said that the stock market is a snapshot for a moment in time and he’s doing what’s best for Main Street, and Wall Street will work out just fine.”</p><p>Mr. Trump also said he was not worried about the potential for rising consumer prices. Despite the confidence projected by the White House, the S&amp;P 500 ended March with its steepest monthly decline in more than two years, driven by uncertainty about the scope of the president’s tariffs. Investors will also be focused on the scheduled release of a monthly report on the health of the U.S. jobs market on Friday.</p><p>“This country is going to be more successful than it ever was,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday. “It’s going to boom. You’re going to have Boomtown, U.S.A.”</p></div></div>
