He was 66.</p><p>His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his son, Matthew Cooper, who did not cite a cause.</p><p>As a screenwriter, Mr. Cooper, who was raised in Harlem, was perhaps best known for the three films often called his Harlem Trilogy. The first, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/archives/film-for-new-jack-city-its-the-same-old-story.html" title="">“New Jack City”</a> (1991), about a ruthless uptown drug lord (Wesley Snipes), presaged a wave of films from Black directors and screenwriters that touched on gang life in the 1990s.</p><p>The trilogy also included two films from 1994: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/25/movies/review-film-brothers-undone-by-life.html#:~:text=%22Sugar%20Hill%2C%22%20which%20may,it%20has%20a%20heavy%20hand." title="">“Sugar Hill,”</a> another drug-hustling drama starring Mr. Snipes, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/23/movies/review-film-a-young-man-torn-by-good-and-bad.html" title="">“Above the Rim,”</a> a basketball drama starring Tupac Shakur as a dealer, which Mr. Cooper wrote with Benny Medina and the film’s director, Jeff Pollack.</p><p>Whatever the medium, Mr. Cooper blended a rich literary sensibility with a deep knowledge of the language and status symbols of the ghetto. “He was very aware of everything from Hemingway to Dostoyevsky,” the author, critic and filmmaker Nelson George, who worked with Mr. Cooper at The Village Voice, said in an interview. “At the same time, he was very, very connected to the slang of the streets.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Cooper captured the glitter as well as the bloodshed of a new generation of 1980s and ’90s hustlers who flashed thick gold ropes and hockey-puck-sized rolls of cash while upending communities in pursuit of overnight fortune.</p><p>“I wanted to detail their voices — the way the hustlers talked,” Mr. Cooper said in a <a href="https://www.stopsmilingonline.com/story_detail.php?id=791" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2007 interview</a> with Stop Smiling, an arts and culture magazine. “I wanted to put it in a literary context like ‘The Great Gatsby.’”</p><p>His goal, he added, was to “take Harlem and the Renaissance and put it in a modern context.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“New Jack City,” “Sugar Hill” and “Above the Rim” were known as Mr. Cooper’s Harlem Trilogy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Warner Bros, 20th Century Fox and New Line Cinema</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In 1986, he published an early in-depth examination of the crack boom for Spin, the music and culture magazine. “<a href="https://barrymichaelc.medium.com/crack-2e9646f1b70f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sinewy arms</a> folded across their chests laden with gold medallions,” he wrote in the article, “a silent roar creasing their lips in the guise of a sneer, the young lions usher their prey in and out of video parlors and misty hallways.”</p><p>A year later, he won the award for best magazine feature from the National Association of Black Journalists for his Spin article <a href="https://barrymichaelc.medium.com/before-the-wire-in-cold-blood-the-baltimore-teen-murders-ffa89f47f2b1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“In Cold Blood: The Baltimore Teen Murders,”</a> about the eruption of gun violence among teenagers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>His 1987 Village Voice cover article <a href="https://barrymichaelc.medium.com/kids-killing-kids-new-jack-city-eats-its-young-1d63f53fd652" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>“</em></a><a href="https://barrymichaelc.medium.com/kids-killing-kids-new-jack-city-eats-its-young-1d63f53fd652" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kids Killing Kids: New Jack City Eats Its Young</a>” chronicled the exploding drug trade in Detroit, including the young street-level dealers who “were making like <a href="https://freshairarchive.org/segments/journalist-and-screenwriter-barry-michael-cooper" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2,000 a day</a>,” Mr. Cooper said in a 1991 interview with Terry Gross of the NPR program “Fresh Air.”</p><p>“These were new examples of the privileged underclass, so to speak,” he said. “The ones who carried beepers and cellular phones, and drove Jeeps and went out to the malls in Michigan and spent $10,000 at a drop at Gucci’s and Fendi’s. I had never seen that before.”</p><p>The article was a showcase for a street term — “new jack” — that Mr. Cooper made his own, albeit with a twist. “My brother used the term a lot,” he told Stop Smiling. “He used to say, ‘Yeah, that kid is a new jack,’” meaning “someone who’s new to the game and frontin.’ It’s almost a derogatory term — almost like a rookie.”</p><p>He added: “Then I heard a song by Grandmaster Caz, and he used a line about this guy who was ‘a new jack clown.’ I took the phrase and wanted to flip it. It rang strong, new jack.”</p><p>Mr. Cooper again invoked the term in 1988 with <a href="https://barrymichaelc.medium.com/teddy-rileys-new-jack-swing-harlem-gangsters-raise-a-genius-1f441da4e7f1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Teddy Riley’s New Jack Swing,”</a> an article in The Voice in which he gave a name to the <a href="https://timeline.carnegiehall.org/genres/new-jack-swing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blend of hip-hop, dance-pop and R&amp;B</a> pioneered by Mr. Riley, a prominent record producer and songwriter, as epitomized by artists like Keith Sweat and Bobby Brown.</p><p>By that point, “Kids Killing Kids” had already opened the door to Hollywood. Two weeks after the article was published, Mr. Cooper said in <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/new-jack-comeback/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2007 interview</a> with The Voice, “I was on a first-class flight to Hollywood to meet with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/arts/music/quincy-jones-dead.html" title="">Quincy Jones</a>. My head was huge.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Mr. Cooper was hired to retool a script by the screenwriter Thomas Lee Wright based on the story of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/nyregion/nicky-barnes-dead.html" title="">Nicky Barnes</a>, the heroin lord of Harlem in the 1960s and ’70s. He updated it for the crack era, focusing on a fictional kingpin, Nino Brown, in what became “New Jack City.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>From left, Ice-T, Vanessa P.

It eventually earned nearly $50 million and was released at “a <a href="https://thesource.com/2024/03/08/today-in-hip-hop-history-cult-classic-film-new-jack-city-premiered-in-theaters-33-years-ago/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pivotal time</a>,” <a href="https://thesource.com/author/pologod/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sha Be Allah</a> wrote in an appraisal for The Source magazine last year.</p><p>In 1991, he wrote, “the blaxploitation film genre had been defunct for over a decade, leaving a gaping hole in ‘Black Hollywood.’ ‘New Jack City’ was a harbinger of the resurgence of Black actors, writers and filmmakers in Hollywood, as well as the crystallization of Hip Hop’s synergistic capabilities.”</p><p>Barry Michael Cooper was born on June 12, 1958, in Harlem, the elder of two sons of Lafayette and Josephine Cooper. He spent his formative years in <a href="https://esplanade-gardens.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Esplanade Gardens</a>, a cooperative high-rise complex. “You had all levels of society in there,” he later said, “from millionaires to people on welfare.”</p><p>He recalled spending Saturdays at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, reading Harlem Renaissance writers like <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/22/specials/hughes-obit.html#:~:text=Langston%20Hughes%2C%20the%20noted%20writer,known%20for%20his%20folksy%20humor." title="">Langston Hughes</a> and Wallace Thurman. After high school, he spent a year at North Carolina Central University, in Durham, N.C., before transferring to Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. Along the way, he fell in love with the narrative nonfiction of Gay Talese, Joan Didion, Tom Wolfe and others associated with the New Journalism movement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 1980, Mr. Cooper embarked on a journalism career of his own with a piece for The Voice, “The Gospel According to Parliament,” about the funk titan George Clinton’s celebrated ensemble. His career as a reporter thrived in the 1980s, but he largely abandoned print for Hollywood after “New Jack City” became a hit.</p><p>Success, he admitted, went to his head. “I got so high on myself that I <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/new-jack-comeback/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">turned down jobs</a>,” he told The Voice in 2007.</p><p>He eventually found himself in a tangled relationship with a woman that resulted in his arrest on charges of assault in 1997, according to The Voice. The terms of his plea deal required him to leave Los Angeles for a year; when he returned, he found that opportunities had evaporated.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Cooper attended a screening of the documentary “Planet Rock: The Story of Hip-Hop and the Crack Generation” at the Paley Center for Media in New York City in 2011.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John W.
