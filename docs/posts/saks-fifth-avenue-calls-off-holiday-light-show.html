The news <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCO2obKOJxp/?igsh=MWNrYnY0em5hbHMyMQ==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">began appearing on social media</a> early this week, and was based on employees’ accounts.</p><p>In confirming the decision, a representative for Saks <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/11/us-news/saks-fifth-avenue-nixes-famed-holiday-lights-show-challenging-year/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The New York Post</a> on Monday that it had been a “challenging year for luxury.”<span>  </span></p><p>The store said in a statement that it instead planned to celebrate the centenary of its flagship store by “honoring the architectural significance of this iconic building, elegantly illuminating the facade and framing the holiday windows.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Along with the department store’s vaunted holiday windows, the light show had for nearly two decades drawn crowds to 611 Fifth Avenue, with many visitors pairing the show with a nighttime stop at the nearby Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.</p><p>In the statement, a spokeswoman for Saks Fifth Avenue noted that “for some time, we have contemplated changing our approach.” Yet the decision appeared to have been made recently, with <a href="https://pressroom.saks.com/news-releases/news-release-details/saks-fifth-avenue-debuts-gifts-delight-holiday-campaign" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a news release</a> from October including a mention of the light display, noting that like the celebrated Saks holiday windows, the display would be “presented by Mastercard.”</p><p>It was not clear whether the decision to call off the light show represented a pause, or an end to the tradition, but Saks confirmed that it was not related to the company’s relationship to Mastercard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Saks Fifth Avenue Carousel of Dreams holiday display, sponsored by Dior and Mastercard, in 2023.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The annual light show, which began in 2004, was typically unveiled in late November and ran through early January. The display was timed to repeat every few minutes.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In its early years, the show involved a similar display every holiday season. Massive snowflakes projected onto the store’s facade appeared and disappeared as Christmas music played. By 2010, the display grew more sophisticated, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_9AYqhaw64" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bubbles that appeared to emerge from the store windows</a> and float up the front of the building.</p><p> For several years, the display turned the store into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_qQEuVkrIA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a blinking castle</a>, its pillars and spires changing color every several seconds under a fringe of icicles. Even during the pandemic, the show went on.</p><p>In 2022, as part of a collaboration with the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the show involved rocket ships, kaleidoscopic images and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7t-neiz_sk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the musician himself</a> playing “Your Song” at the unveiling.</p><p>Last year, in a partnership with Dior, the store created a so-called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dAjlmRFp2A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carousel of Dreams with zodiac signs</a> on a disc that pulsed with lights and appeared to spin like a roulette wheel, as music played and fireworks shot into the sky.</p><p>Money was no object then, or so it seemed.</p><p>On social media this week, many wondered about the company’s decision to call off the light show precisely on the flagship store’s 100th anniversary. “What better year to make an <em>extravaganza</em>?” said KaVonna Holloway, the host of “The Introvert’s Social Hour” podcast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“That’s what people expect every year,” Ms. Holloway said in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theintrovertssocialhour/video/7436238011622247711" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video on TikTok</a>. “And you say, ‘No, we’re not going to do it. We’re going to highlight the window displays.’ Nobody wants that.”</p></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the New York Region</h2><h3>A look at life, culture, politics and more in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Congestion Pricing:</strong> Gov.
