Trump to congratulate him after he won the presidential election. Mr. Trump took the call, becoming the first American president or president-elect to speak to a Taiwanese leader in decades.</p><p>This time, after Mr. Trump won a second term in the White House, Taiwan was <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aipl/202411070042.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quick to deny reports</a> that its current leader, Lai Ching-te, was seeking a similar phone call with the president-elect.</p><p>The contrast was telling.</p><p>Taiwan appears to be preparing for a more delicate, possibly testy, relationship with Mr. Trump upon his return to the White House. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump had suggested that Taiwan should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/world/asia/trump-taiwan-defense-chips.html" title="">pay the United States</a> for helping defend the island from China, and complained that Taiwan had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-joe-rogan-chips-science-act.html" title="">stolen America’s business</a> in semiconductors.</p><p>“There is more anxiety this time” in Taiwan about Mr. Trump taking office, Chen Ming-chi, a former senior adviser on Taiwan’s National Security Council, said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By “declaring that we are not going to seek a congratulatory phone call, that means we are more realistic,” said Professor Chen, who teaches at Taiwan’s National Tsing Hua University. Mr. Lai issued a congratulatory <a href="https://english.president.gov.tw/News/6830" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement about Mr. Trump’s victory</a>.</p><p>Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are high, with frequent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/world/asia/china-taiwan-war-games.html" title="">Chinese military drills</a> stoking fears of an accidental conflict. A call with Mr. Trump could prompt a forceful reaction from China, which claims the island as its territory and resents whenever Taiwan acts like, or is treated as, a sovereign nation.</p><p>For instance, that 2016 call between Mr. Trump and Tsai Ing-wen, who was then Taiwan’s president, drew condemnation from China. The United States had avoided leader-level contacts with Taiwan after it severed ties in 1979 to switch to recognition of China.</p><p>The call was only the first of several notable steps by Mr. Trump that bolstered U.S. support for Taiwan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His administration later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/us/politics/us-arms-sale-taiwan-china.html" title="">increased weapons sales</a> to Taiwan and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/world/asia/taiwan-us-azar-china.html" title="">sent senior officials</a> to visit, in defiance of Beijing’s complaints. Such moves gained Mr. Trump <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/32538-who-do-people-asia-pacific-want-win-us-presidentia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wide popularity in Taiwan</a> even as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics/global-survey-trump.html" title="">much of the world soured</a> on American leadership under him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A plane carrying Alex M.

And the lack of formal relations means Taiwan’s president, Mr. Lai, won’t get to make his case in a face-to-face meeting with the new U.S. leader.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/30/donald-trump-2024-interview-immigration-ukraine/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">complaints</a> about Taiwan’s military spending and semiconductor industry are adding to the pressure on Taiwan to buy more American weapons and increase investment in building chip plants in the United States.</p><p>“You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business, OK?” he said on a recent episode of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBMoPUAeLnY&amp;t=1s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>,” a popular podcast. “They don’t pay us money for the protection, you know? The mob makes you pay money, right?”</p><p>Professor Chen, the former security adviser, said Taiwan would have to adjust its approach to securing the support of the United States and its allies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“In the past few years, we built our value on two things: democracy and chips,” he said. “But democracy is not a focus of the coming Trump administration, and the chips have turned from our advantage to a bit of a problem, because Trump says we are stealing jobs.”</p><p>Taiwan’s trade may also suffer if President-elect Trump acts on vows to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/trumps-tariffs-global-trade.html" title="">steeply increase tariffs</a> on goods imported into the United States. And some in Taiwan worry that Mr. Trump may lose sight of the island’s concerns as he focuses on his relationship — part pugilistic, part admiring — with China’s strongman leader, Xi Jinping.</p><p>Despite Taiwan’s lack of formal diplomatic relationship with Washington, it relies on U.S. support to counter China’s growing power and military pressure.
