Trump has secretly spoken with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as many as seven times since leaving office, even as he was pressuring Republicans to block military aid to Ukraine to fight Russian invaders, according to a new book by the journalist Bob Woodward.</p><p>The book, titled “War” and scheduled to be published next week, describes a scene in early 2024 at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s estate in Florida, when the former president ordered an aide out of his office so he could conduct a phone call with Mr. Putin. The unidentified aide said the two might have spoken a half-dozen other times since Mr. Trump left the White House.</p><p>The book also reports that Mr. Trump, while still in office early during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, secretly sent Mr. Putin what were then rare Abbott Point of Care test machines for the Russian’s personal use. Mr. Putin, who has been described as particularly anxious about being infected at the time, urged Mr. Trump to not publicly reveal the gesture because it could damage the American president politically. “I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,” Mr. Putin reportedly told him.</p><p>The disclosures raise new questions about Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Putin just weeks before an election that will determine whether the former president will reclaim the White House. A copy of the book was obtained by The New York Times. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/08/bob-woodward-new-book-war-trump-putin-biden/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>, where Mr. Woodward has worked for more than half a century, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/bob-woodward-book-war-joe-biden-putin-netanyahu-trump/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNN</a>, where he often appears as a commentator, also reported on the book on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Woodward, who rose to fame with his Watergate reporting and regularly produces best-selling books with explosive reporting based on access to high-level sources, attributed his account of the continuing communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin to a single Trump aide who is not named in the book. The aide offered no specific details beyond saying there had been what Mr. Woodward characterized as “maybe as many as seven” contacts. Efforts to confirm any post-White House communication between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin on Tuesday were not successful. Nineteen current and former Trump and Biden administration officials and career intelligence officials reached by The Times on Tuesday said they had no knowledge of any contacts between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin in the years since Mr. Trump left office.</p><p>U.S. and Russian officials did <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/63311" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly announce</a> in 2020 that Covid supplies had been sent to Russia shortly after a May 7 telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the time that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/1118964/pompeo-tells-salena-zito-the-world-must-impose-costs-on-china-for-coronavirus/#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“some testing equipment as well as ventilators”</a> had been sent. But officials did not say that it was for Mr. Putin’s personal use or disclose that the Russian president ad advised Mr. Trump to keep their conversation secret.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s campaign on Tuesday dismissed Mr. Woodward’s book by assailing the author with typically personal insults — “a total sleazebag” who is “slow, lethargic, incompetent and overall a boring person with no personality” — without addressing any of the specifics reported in it.</p><p>“None of these made-up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Steven Cheung, the campaign communications director, said in the statement. Mr. Cheung said Mr. Trump did not give Mr. Woodward access for the book and noted that the former president was suing the author over a previous book.</p><p>The Kremlin likewise denied the reporting in Mr. Woodward’s book about conversations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin and the provision of Covid tests. “This is not true,” Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman, said in a text message. “It’s a typical bogus story in the context of the pre-election political campaign.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>While generally disputing Mr. Woodward’s account, the Trump campaign statement did not explicitly say whether the former president had spoken with Mr. Putin since leaving office and the campaign did not immediately respond to a question about that. But Mr. Trump’s oft-expressed affinity for the master of the Kremlin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/us/politics/trump-putin-ukraine.html" title="">has long baffled even his own appointees</a>, prompted investigations and troubled Republican national security specialists.</p><p>Mr. Woodward’s book includes other tantalizing reporting that had Washington buzzing on Tuesday, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/world/middleeast/biden-netanyahu-israel-woodward-book.html" title="">profanity-laced tirades by President Biden</a> about and to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel over the war in Gaza over the last year.</p><p>Among the episodes Mr. Woodward recounts is a July 4 private lunch after Mr. Biden’s disastrous debate performance in which Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, a longtime confidant, tried to gently broach the idea that the president drop out of the race.</p><p>“I don’t want to see your legacy jeopardized,” Mr. Blinken reportedly told Mr. Biden, saying that any president gets “one sentence” as his legacy in history. “If this decision leads you to staying in and winning re-election, great,” Mr. Blinken said. “If it leads to you staying in and losing re-election, that’s the sentence.”</p><p>The book also reports that Mr. Biden came to regret appointing Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, expressing fury after the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the president’s son, Hunter Biden. “Should never have picked Garland,” Mr. Biden told an associate, according to the book.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The president received consolation from a surprising source after the botched troop withdrawal from Afghanistan from former President George W. Bush. “Oh boy, I can understand what you’re going through,” Mr. Bush told Mr. Biden, according to the book. Mr. Bush said that he too had felt ill-advised by intelligence officials. </p><p>As for Russia, Mr. Biden faulted his own former ticket mate, President Barack Obama, for screwing up the response to Russia’s initial, more limited invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “That’s why we are here,” Mr. Biden is quoted telling a friend. He added, “Barack never took Putin seriously.”</p><p>After reports about Mr. Woodward’s book on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Mr. Trump for being too close to Mr. Putin, citing the provision of Covid testing equipment. “Everybody was scrambling to get these kits,” she said during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/08/us/harris-trump-election/heres-the-latest-on-the-presidential-race?smid=url-share" title="">an interview on Howard Stern’s satellite radio show</a>. “This guy who is president of the United States is sending them to Russia, to a murderous dictator, for his personal use.”</p><p>Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Mr. Trump’s running mate, responded to questions about the former president’s possible contacts with Mr. Putin by insulting Mr. Woodward before saying he had not discussed the matter with Mr. Trump. “Even if it’s true,” Mr. Vance added, there would be nothing wrong with speaking to world leaders.</p><p>U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Mr. Putin had ordered the Russian government to intervene in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a conclusion that Mr. Trump rejected, suggesting that he believed Mr. Putin’s denial. While the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III did not find a criminal conspiracy that could be proved in court, he documented an unusual number of contacts between Russia and people in Mr. Trump’s circle during that campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Since leaving office, Mr. Trump has continued to praise Mr. Putin. He called the Russian leader a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html" title="">“genius”</a> when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 and since then has refused to say that Ukraine should win the war. He has criticized American aid to Ukraine and leaned on congressional Republicans not to approve more assistance. He has boasted that if he wins he will negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine within 24 hours and do so even before the inauguration.</p><p>Mr. Trump has not explained how he would do that, but possible terms described last month by Mr. Vance sounded a lot like what Mr. Putin would want. Mr. Vance said that Russia could keep the Ukrainian territory it has seized by force in violation of international law and receive a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">“guarantee of neutrality”</a> from Ukraine, which would not be allowed to join NATO.</p><p>Former presidents meet with foreign counterparts after leaving office from time to time. In fact, Mr. Trump has hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and others at Mar-a-Lago. But those meetings were publicly known, and Mr. Trump posed for pictures with his guests.</p><p>It would be highly unusual for a former president to privately talk with a top American adversary like Mr. Putin without clearing it with the current administration — especially at a time when the United States and Russia are on opposite sides of a war in Europe. Mr. Biden has not spoken with Mr. Putin since the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Woodward’s book does not report what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin discussed in the call in early 2024, nor does it provide details about the additional calls mentioned by the Trump aide. It quotes Jason Miller, a top campaign aide to Mr. Trump, saying that he had “not heard that they’re talking, so I’d push back on that.” But Mr. Miller also said that “I’m sure they’d know how to get in touch with each other” if they did want to talk.</p><p>Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence appointed by Mr. Biden, hedged on the question when asked by Mr. Woodward. “I would not purport to be aware of all contacts with Putin,” she told him. “I wouldn’t purport to speak to what President Trump may or may not have done.”</p><p>Maggie Haberman<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jonathan Swan<!-- -->, <!-- -->Julian E.
