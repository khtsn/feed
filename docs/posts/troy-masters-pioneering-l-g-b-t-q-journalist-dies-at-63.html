He was 63.</p><p>His sister, Tammy Masters, said that his body was found in his apartment by his friend and former partner, Arturo Jiminez, whom she had asked to make a wellness check after not hearing from him for two days. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner determined that the cause was suicide.</p><p>Mr. Masters’s career took him from Tennessee, where he grew up, to New York City in the 1980s. He worked at the publications Outweek, QW, LGNY and its successor, Gay City News, before he moved west and started The Los Angeles Blade in 2017 in partnership with The Washington Blade, an L.G.B.T.Q. paper founded in 1969.</p><p>“Troy was a pioneer of L.G.B.T.Q. media who was fueled by a passion for advocacy and brought his commitment to justice, truth and best-in-class journalism,” Kevin Naff, the editor of The Washington Blade and an owner of both the Washington and Los Angeles papers, said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In the first issue of The Los Angeles Blade<a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2017/03/23/welcome-los-angeles-blade/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">, Mr. Masters described the heady promise</a> — and the challenges — that his readers faced.</p><p>“We are living in a paradigm-shifting moment in real time,” he wrote. “You can feel it. Sometimes it’s overwhelming. Sometimes it’s toxic. Sometimes it’s perplexing, even terrifying. On the other hand, sometimes it’s just downright exhilarating.”</p><p>Mr. Masters, the founding publisher, and his staff built the newspaper, published twice a month, and its website into a reliable source of news, health, arts and entertainment coverage for a large L.G.B.T.Q. audience — with a cautious eye on how politics affected its readers.</p><p>Two years ago, Mr. Masters used his platform at The Blade to raise concerns about an outbreak of the infectious viral disease monkeypox, or mpox, in Los Angeles County and its disproportionate impact on gay and bisexual men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Masters discussed the viral disease monkeypox at a town hall event in West Hollywood, Calif., in 2002. “This is not a gay disease nor is it a sex-panic,” he wrote, “but it is hitting our community hard and we must protect ourselves and each other.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dan Steinberg/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“This is not a gay disease nor is it a sex-panic,” <a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/06/17/the-politics-of-monkeypox/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Masters wrote</a>, “but it is hitting our community hard and we must protect ourselves and each other.” He added, “If monkeypox is used as a cudgel against the community of men who have sex with men, it will be time to ACT UP and fight again.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Masters helped organize town hall events with health experts in the Los Angeles area to educate the public.</p><p>“He did great, important work that saved people,” Mr. Naff said. “It didn’t become an epidemic because people like Troy spoke out.”</p><p>Troy Davis Masters was born on April 13, 1961, in Gallatin, Tenn., near Nashville. His mother, Josie Hesson Masters, was a makeup artist who divorced Jimmy Davis Masters, a bread deliverer, when Troy was young. He was raised by his mother and his stepfather, Ray Kirkland, a musician who performed at the Grand Ole Opry.</p><p>Two incidents in Troy’s young life made him aware of the perils of being gay. While on summer vacation in Dothan, Ala., Mr. Kirkland’s hometown, he overhead Mr. Kirkland tell another family member, with disdain, “Troy is a queer.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In an essay in Gay City News in 2015, Mr. Masters wrote: “Even at 13, I understood that my feelings for other boys were supposed to be secret. Now I knew terror.”</p><p>And shortly after that, he recalled, while traveling by train on his own from Dothan to Nashville, he was sexually assaulted by the maître d’ of the dining car.</p><p>“While I knew without a doubt that I was gay,” he <a href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2018/09/28/ending-a-long-silence/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in The Los Angeles Blade in 2018</a>, “telling anyone about the rape would not only have outed me (and I was not prepared for that), it would have forced me to deal with anger and hatred toward gays I was already trying to avoid at home.”</p><p>After graduating in 1986 from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with a bachelor’s degree in communications, he worked as a marketing manager at Whittle Communications, whose media properties included single-sponsor publications.</p><p>In 1988, Mr. Masters arrived in New York City, where he sold advertising for the computer publication PC Magazine. He was doing well at his job, but he recognized the growing suffering caused by the AIDS epidemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A sick friend spotted a classified ad in The Village Voice for a job at Outweek, a gay and lesbian magazine. He responded to the ad and became the magazine’s advertising director. After Outweek closed in 1991, he became the publisher and an owner of QW, a glossy weekly for gay and lesbian readers, which folded after a year when a major investor died.</p><p>After spending time as the publisher of a weekly casting magazine for actors, Mr. Masters resurfaced in L.G.B.T.Q. media in 1995 as the founder and publisher of LGNY: Lesbian &amp; Gay New York. He had been urged to start it by a friend, the writer M. Gessen, who told him he needed to help L.G.B.T.Q. people in New York who were “suffering an urgent health crisis, fighting for basic legal rights and against an increase in violence,” <a href="https://voyagela.com/interview/meet-troy-masters-troy-masters-midwilshre/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Masters told Voyage LA</a> magazine in 2018.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Masters, center, in 1997, when he was the publisher of LGNY, with Paul Schindler, the editor, and Sharon Chen, a printer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Linda Rosier for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In 1998, Mr. Masters was one of the first volunteers in New York City for a test of an experimental AIDS vaccine. “It’s anxiety-producing and exciting at the same time, but I’m going to have to live with this crisis one way or the other,” he was quoted as saying in<span>  </span>The New York Times.</p><p>LGNY struggled financially. But Mr. Masters found a savior when <a href="https://gaycitynews.com/gay-city-news-parent-sold-to-information-technology-executive/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the paper was taken over in 2002 by Community Media</a>, a small chain of local papers owned by John W. Sutter. LGNY was renamed Gay City News, and Mr. Masters served as its associate publisher until he relocated to Los Angeles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“He wanted those publications to tell stories that were being misreported, underreported or overlooked by the mainstream media,” Paul Schindler, who was the editor of LGNY and Gay City News, said in an interview. “Stories having to do with H.I.V., sexual health, certain police abuses in terms of false arrests, nondiscrimination laws, marriage equality, hate crimes and transgender rights.”</p><p>The paper has won awards from the New York Press Association, the Society of Professional Journalists and <a href="https://www.nlgja.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists</a>.</p><p>“His tenacity and vision not only informed but also empowered, ensuring that L.G.B.T.Q.+ stories were told with authenticity and dignity,” NLGJA said in a statement after his death.</p><p>In addition to his sister, Mr. Masters is survived by his mother, Josie Kirkland; his father; and Mr. Jiminez, with whom he had remained close.</p><p>Mr. Masters’s first journalistic venture in Los Angeles was The Pride LA, a bimonthly newspaper that the Mirror Media Group began publishing in 2015. But he left a year later when he went to the office after the mass shooting that killed 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub, in Orlando, Fla., and finding both a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag with the image of an AK-47 on it and a MAGA hat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Masters had known that his business partners were Republicans, but after that he felt he could not continue with the partnership. “I made a decision to stick with my community,” he told Voyage LA, “and vowed to build an enterprise that truly respected it.”</p><p><em>If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.</em></p></div></div></section></article></div>
