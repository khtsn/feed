Large, destructive waves were expected near the coast. The Bermuda government posted <a href="https://x.com/BdaGovernment/status/1824754209448690058" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">footage</a> on Saturday morning of the waves pounding against the rocky shore.</p></div></div><div><div><p>As daylight approached on Saturday, the government warned residents to stay indoors. The second half of the storm was expected to match or outpace its earlier intensity, <a href="https://x.com/BdaGovernment/status/1824772369669304343" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it said</a>, adding that winds would “rapidly and dangerously pick up again with full force.”</p><p>Many households found themselves in the dark. Outages affected more than 25,000 customers early Saturday morning. <a href="https://belco.bm/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BELCO</a>, Bermuda’s sole electricity provider, said it was not safe for its crews to be in the field late Friday and that it would resume work on restoring power when conditions improved.</p><p>The storm has prompted a near-total shutdown of Bermuda’s transportation services. Ferry services were suspended, and bus services were halted Friday evening.</p><p>L.F. Wade International Airport closed on Friday night and said it would reopen on Sunday after the storm had passed. Ahead of the closure, American Airlines and United Airlines added flights to accommodate the surge of travelers seeking refuge on the East Coast of the United States.</p><p>Bermuda is well-practiced in dealing with hurricane-force winds but, before this week, it had only sustained a direct hit nine times since 1851, according to <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=6.94/32.328/-64.766&amp;search=eyJzZWFyY2hTdHJpbmciOiJCZXJtdWRhIiwic2VhcmNoVHlwZSI6Imdlb2NvZGVkIiwib3NtSUQiOiIxOTkzMjA4IiwiY2F0ZWdvcmllcyI6WyJINSIsIkg0IiwiSDMiLCJIMiIsIkgxIl0sInllYXJzIjpbXSwibW9udGhzIjpbXSwiZW5zbyI6W10sInByZXNzdXJlIjp7InJhbmdlIjpbMCwxMDMwXSwiaW5jbHVkZVVua25vd25QcmVzc3VyZSI6dHJ1ZX0sImJ1ZmZlciI6NzAsImJ1ZmZlclVuaXQiOlsiTWlsZXMiXSwic29ydFNlbGVjdGlvbiI6eyJ2YWx1ZSI6InllYXJzX25ld2VzdCIsImxhYmVsIjoiWWVhciAoTmV3ZXN0KSJ9LCJhcHBseVRvQU9JIjp0cnVlLCJpc1N0b3JtTGFiZWxzVmlzaWJsZSI6dHJ1ZX0=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s historical hurricane database</a>.

The New York office of the Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/nwsnewyorkny/status/1824251705304944978?s=46&amp;t=btsi_vkrnKd3vNNuaDxgIw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned swimmers</a> to stay out of the water. The storm is expected to move off the coast of Canada early next week.</p><p>This week, Ernesto brought up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Puerto Rico, the Weather Service said.</p></div></div><div><p>The storm knocked out power to more than 600,000 customers. Luma Energy, which distributes electricity in the territory, said on Saturday morning that nearly 112,000 customers were still without power.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/12/multimedia/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg/12wea-ernesto-02-cfqg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Rainwater flows over a four-lane road surrounded by trees.
