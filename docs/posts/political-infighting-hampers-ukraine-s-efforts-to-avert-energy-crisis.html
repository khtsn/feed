stations, the head of the national electricity company, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, earned praise from Kyiv’s allies and energy experts for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-infrastructure.html" title="">keeping the country’s power grid mostly running</a>.</p><p>But last month, Mr. Kudrytskyi was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/world/europe/ukraine-electric-boss-fired-russia-pounds-power-grid.html" title="">dismissed</a> by the supervisory board of the company, Ukrenergo. Ukrainian lawmakers criticized the move as unjustified given Mr. Kudrytskyi’s record, while countries financing repairs to power plants said it was ill timed as Ukraine scrambles to restore its ravaged energy network before winter.</p><p>Adding to their concern, two members of Ukrenergo’s supervisory board resigned in protest, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/npcukrenergo/posts/949207100581449?ref=embed_post" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying the dismissal was “politically motivated.”</a> Several lawmakers from across the political spectrum said German Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, was behind the move to gain greater control over the company’s management.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, chief executive of Ukrenergo, in Kyiv, in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Political rivalries have disrupted other Ukrainian institutions this year, undermining the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/world/europe/ukraine-parliament.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">smooth functioning of Parliament</a> and causing upheaval in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/world/europe/zelensky-general-valery-zaluzhny-ukraine-military.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">country’s military command</a>. Now, political infighting, highlighted by Mr. Kudrytskyi’s dismissal, is hampering Ukraine’s efforts to avert an energy crisis, according to more than half a dozen current and former Ukrainian energy officials, experts and lawmakers.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They said several top officials involved in repairing the grid or protecting it from Russian attacks had been fired or pushed to resign without apparent reason, and that major policy decisions had been delayed because of political calculations. With substantial funding allocated to strengthening the energy network, they also voiced concerns that some projects might be vulnerable to corruption, a pervasive issue in Ukraine.</p><p>“It’s terrifying,” said Inna Sovsun, an opposition lawmaker who sits on Parliament’s energy committee. “Because in the meantime the energy situation is getting more and more unstable.”</p><p>An International Energy Agency <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/cec49dc2-7d04-442f-92aa-54c18e6f51d6/UkrainesEnergySecurityandtheComingWinter.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> said Ukraine’s electricity deficit this winter could reach as much as six gigawatts, about one-third of what is needed during peak hours.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Kudrytskyi said a major point of contention with the energy ministry had revolved around the strategy for securing energy supplies. He said he had advocated building dozens of small, privately run power plants across the country to make the system less vulnerable to any single Russian attack — an approach supported by most energy experts and international partners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Mr. Kudrytskyi said his suggestions clashed with the position taken by Mr. Galushchenko, the energy minister, who favored greater centralization under state-owned companies. By the time Ukraine’s government adopted a plan to decentralize its network, <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/storage/app/uploads/public/66a/ce4/791/66ace47912598027335435.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in mid-July</a>, experts and diplomats said that it was too late to bolster energy supplies significantly before winter.</p><p>In written responses, Mr. Galushchenko denied pushing for Mr. Kudrytskyi’s dismissal, saying he had no influence over Ukrenergo’s supervisory board. He also dismissed claims that infighting had derailed Ukraine’s energy policies, saying that planned repairs at power stations had been “completed on time” and that Ukraine’s energy network was entering winter “with the highest possible level of readiness.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the United States and European Union ambassadors to Ukraine told Mr. Galushchenko during a lunch last month in Kyiv that he had been too slow in developing decentralized generation capacities, according to two participants who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the details publicly.</p><p>As word of Mr. Kudrytskyi’s impending firing spread last month, the E.U. ambassador, Katarina Mathernova, also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=922426583043422&amp;set=pcb.922417959710951" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote to the Ukrainian prime minister</a>, Denys Shmyhal, warning that such a move “could jeopardize our collective ability to support Ukrenergo and other priority measures of Ukraine’s vital energy security.”</p><p>The dispute has cost Ukraine precious time in preparing for winter, according to Mr. Kudrytskyi. The solution, he said, was “to put aside any political preferences or any wish to create ambitious plans or whatever and follow one simple rule: Listen to the engineers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Utility workers repairing electricity lines after a Russian missile struck nearby last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Kudrytskyi was one of several energy officials to fall over political disputes recently, according to several lawmakers, energy experts and Western diplomats in Kyiv.</p><p>In May, Oleksandr Kubrakov was fired as infrastructure minister for reasons never made clear, they said. The next month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/world/europe/ukraine-reconstruction-resignation.html" title="">Mustafa Nayyem</a>, the head of the reconstruction agency, resigned, citing bureaucratic delays for project approvals and payments to contractors.</p><p>The two men had overseen multimillion-dollar plans to build shelters around Ukrainian substations to protect them from Russian attacks, including from shrapnel, drones and missiles.</p><p>But in an interview in June after his resignation, Mr. Nayyem said the government had failed to release a significant portion of the funds earmarked for the agency to pay contractors, causing the construction of shelters at several substations to be delayed or halted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Maksym Shkil, the founder of Autostrada, a Ukrainian company involved in building the shelters, said his company had stopped work over complaints that the government owed him more than $200 million for unpaid work.</p><p>The government recently <a href="https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1013033.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that 85 percent of the shrapnel and drone shelters had been completed, but even that partial coverage is months past the original deadline of March set in a document from the reconstruction agency obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>Mr. Nayyem said a letter he had sent this year to Prime Minister Shmyhal to try to resolve the funding issues had gone unanswered. “The reason is political issues, personal relationships,” he said.</p><p>In Kyiv’s political circles, Mr. Kubrakov and Mr. Nayyem were seen as aligned with the United States on spending priorities for rebuilding aid, a stance that irritated some government officials who resented what they saw as intrusive American oversight. Both had also spoken out against corruption, even reporting lawmakers to watchdogs <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/lawmaker-suspected-of-attempting-to-bribe-top-officials-released-on-bail/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on suspicion of attempted bribery</a> — upsetting some officials, according to <a href="https://english.nv.ua/nation/anti-corruption-activist-on-recent-government-resignations-interview-50426297.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anticorruption activists</a>.</p><p>Mr. Shmyhal’s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Ukraine has focused on protecting substations because Russia targeted them during the first winter of the war. But energy experts say the approach left the country open to being blindsided by a shift in Russian tactics.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>This spring, Russia began attacking power plants directly, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-attack.html" title="">the impact was devastating</a>: Ukraine lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity between March and July, <a href="https://ukraine.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/ENG%20Attacks%20on%20Ukraine%E2%80%99s%20Energy%20Infrastructure-%20%20Harm%20to%20the%20Civilian%20Population.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a> — far more than can be restored before the winter.</p><p>Oleksiy Mikhailenko, a former energy adviser at the British Embassy in Kyiv, said it was clear from the start of the war that Russia could strike power plants. “But the government seems to have not employed any proactive policies to secure the energy supply,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Kudrytskyi said that as soon as early 2023 he had advocated decentralizing the electricity supply, supporting the entry of private companies into the energy market to build and operate small power plants across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>German Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, in Berlin in June.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Annegret Hilse/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>But he said Mr. Galushchenko and other government officials had instead pushed for large-scale, centralized projects. In particular, Mr. Galushchenko pushed multibillion-dollar plans to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraine-start-building-4-new-nuclear-reactors-this-year-minister-2024-01-25/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">build four new nuclear reactors</a> through Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, where he once worked.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The move has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-buy-russia-made-nuclear-reactor-uproar-war-corruption/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faced fierce opposition from lawmakers</a> who say the reactors are costly and will take years to build. They also raised concerns about potential corruption, noting that Energoatom has been mired in scandals recently, with some of its top managers currently <a href="https://nabu.gov.ua/en/news/zavolod-nnia-100-mln-grn-pri-bud-vnitctv-skhovishcha-v-dpratc-ovanogo-iadernogo-paliva-5-p-dozriuvanikh/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under investigation on charges of embezzling funds</a>.</p><p>Mr. Galushchenko said he had started plans to decentralize generation capacities “in the shortest possible time.” He dismissed the opposition to building reactors as the work of lawmakers lobbying for private energy companies.</p><p>Energy experts say that while the energy grid’s decentralization was important, it would not fully compensate for the damage Russia has done to power plants, which can be protected only by air-defense systems — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/world/europe/ukraine-missile-defenses.html" title="">a capability that Ukraine sorely lacks today</a>.</p><p>Still, Mr. Kudrytskyi said if Ukraine had begun decentralizing its energy network last year, it would not be scrambling today to secure energy supplies before winter. “This wrong planning and this approach to recovery cost us more than a year,” he said. </p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia">Russia-Ukraine War</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/10/15/world/europe/ukraine-energy-crisis-russia.html">15</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Deadly Month:</strong> September was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/russia-casualties-ukraine-war.html">bloodiest month of the war for Russian forces in Ukraine</a>, U.S. officials said, bringing the number of Russia’s dead and wounded to more than 600,000 troops since the war began.</p></li><li><p><strong>Russia’s Shadow Fleet:</strong> Almost two years since an oil “price cap” was enacted by the West, a new report shows that nearly 70% of the Kremlin’s oil is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/russian-oil-price-cap-shadow-fleet.html">transported on “shadow tankers” that are evading the restrictions</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standup Comedy Sweeps Ukraine:</strong> Even as the conflict with Russia grinds on, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/world/europe/stand-up-comedy-ukraine.html">a new generation of comics in Ukraine</a> is trying to make people laugh — and raise money for the war effort.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>How We Verify Our Reporting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Our team of visual journalists analyzes satellite images, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/insider/verifying-images-of-the-war-in-ukraine.html">photographs</a>, videos and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/28/world/europe/reskin-russian-radio-ukraine-war.html">radio transmissions</a> to independently confirm troop movements and other details.</p></li><li><p>We monitor and authenticate reports on social media, corroborating these with eyewitness accounts and interviews. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-journalism.html">Read more about our reporting efforts</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
