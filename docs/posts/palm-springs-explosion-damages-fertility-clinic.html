The explosion happened less than a mile from downtown Palm Springs.</p><p>The mayor, Ron deHarte, said there were still structures on fire in the area.</p><p>He added that there were no reports of injuries as of yet and that the source of the explosion was not immediately known.</p><p>A phone number for the clinic, American Reproductive Centers, did not appear to be in service on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A website for the office listed fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization and egg freezing, among its services.</p><p>The police, firefighters and medical crews were on the scene, the mayor said. Mr. deHarte said that the public should avoid the area.</p><p>Videos showed flames licking the shattered terra-cotta tiles of the clinic’s roof as debris clogged its entrance.</p><p>Claudio Chavez, who works at an upholstery shop near the explosion, said that his store’s windows were blown out.</p><p>“I was just in my shop waiting for clients, and all of a sudden it felt like a big explosion,” he said. “It took out our window. I just saw a bunch of smoke.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He said people came out of homes and businesses onto the street to see what happened. Mr. Chavez, a logistics manager at the shop, said he began picking up debris and sweeping up broken glass.</p><p>Scott Pastorius, 61, a construction project manager from Los Angeles, was sitting in his vacation home four blocks away from the explosion site when he heard a loud boom.</p><p>“My initial response was earthquake, but in a split second I realized it was too intense,” he said. “The whole house rattled and then the glass in the door I saw flexing.”</p><p>Mr. Pastorius said he ran into his backyard, where he saw a plume of smoke billowing nearby. He grabbed his camera and got in his car and drove to the scene.</p><p>The damage was extensive, he said.</p><p>The Desert Regional Medical Center across the street, a liquor store and a pancake house had windows blown out, he said. A nearby hotel also had doors blown off and its portico was damaged, Mr. Pastorius said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Pastorius said the roof of the fertility clinic had collapsed and the entire back side of the building had been blown out. Debris from the explosion shot across the street to the other curb, he said.</p><p>“That was a very intense explosion,” Mr. Pastorius said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Claire Fahy reports on New York City and the surrounding area for The Times.</p></div><div><p>Simon J.
