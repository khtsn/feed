Four of them were earlier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages.html" title="">released in an exchange</a> on Saturday.</p><p>Ms. Berger’s mother, Meirav, said she last saw her daughter when they dropped her off at the base on Oct. 5, 2023, two days before the attack. According to a website <a href="https://www.agamberger.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created by her family,</a> and her parents’ accounts in Israeli news media, Ms. Berger called her parents in the middle of the attack, using the phone of a friend who was killed next to her. She told them that she could hear shots being fired and that people were crying, but that she was not afraid, according to the website.</p><p>In November 2023, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/family-marks-20th-birthday-of-hostage-agam-berger-with-music-and-song/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Agam Goldstein-Almog</a>, who was taken captive with her daughter and two sons and was released as part of the first cease-fire deal, said that she had been held in a tunnel with Ms. Berger and the other soldiers serving as lookouts who had been captured. She said that Ms. Berger was praying a lot, and seemed to be in good spirits.</p><p>In August, Ms. Berger’s family held an event to mark her birthday at Tel Aviv’s Anu Museum of the Jewish People, centered on music because she is passionate about music and plays the violin. She has a twin sister and two other siblings.</p><h2 id="link-405dcd67">Gadi Moses</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gadi Moses being escorted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters as he is handed over to the Red Cross in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jehad Alshrafi/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Gadi Moses, a farming expert, was abducted in Kibbutz Nir Oz after stepping out of his home to try to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-father-kidnap.html" title="">reason with the militants</a>.</p><p>His partner, Efrat Katz, hid inside a safe room in their home with her daughter and two visiting grandchildren, before they were also taken by militants.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/middleeast/arbel-yehud-civilian-hostage-gaza.html" title="">released a video</a>, which an analysis by The New York Times dates to Jan. 25, in which she says, “My family, I’m OK.
