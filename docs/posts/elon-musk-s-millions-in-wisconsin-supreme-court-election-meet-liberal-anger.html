He has posted about the contest countless times on social media, held a livestream with his chosen candidate and is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">planning to visit</a> Wisconsin on Sunday evening, two days before the Tuesday election.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In doing so, Mr. Musk has made himself the face of a contest with significant real-world stakes, and turned it into a test of whether rising Democratic anger can eclipse a billionaire’s political machine.</p><p>A victory by the liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, would signify a backlash to Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk’s collective stewardship of the country, giving Democrats hope that all is not lost.</p><p>A triumph by the conservative contender, Brad Schimel, who is backed by more than $20 million from Mr. Musk and allied groups, would mean that the billionaire has written a new recipe for success for Trumpian officeseekers across the country while making himself, rather than the candidates, the center of attention.</p><p>“Everyone has an opinion on him,” said Rohn Bishop, the Republican mayor of Waupun, Wis. “He’s the talk of everything.”</p><p>Mr. Bishop recalled a town-hall meeting with local Republican state legislators this month that was hijacked by questions about Mr. Musk’s efforts to disembowel large parts of the federal government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Mr. Musk comes bearing financial incentives. He is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/elon-musk-wisconsin-petition.html" title="">offering $100 to Wisconsin voters</a> who sign a petition “in opposition to activist judges,” and, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-million-dollar-petition.html" title="">repeating a gambit</a> he used in Pennsylvania before the presidential election, he created a sweepstakes in which he would hand two $1 million checks to people who signed the petition and voted. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/elon-musk-paying-voters-wisconsin.html" title="">later clarified</a> that he would not condition the payouts on voting. Campaign finance experts suggested that paying for votes would violate state law.</p><h2 id="link-67097a7">‘The Whole Country Is Watching’</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Brad Schimel, a judge in Waukesha County, Wis., and the race’s conservative candidate, has been endorsed by President Trump.

Democrats want Judge Crawford, a liberal jurist in Dane County, to win and maintain the court’s 4-3 liberal majority. Republicans want Judge Schimel, who sits on a court in Waukesha County, to seize back control for conservatives after they lost it in 2023 — making this the second straight State Supreme Court race that has turned into a national referendum on party enthusiasm.</p><p>Top officials in both parties have focused attention on the race. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House minority leader, said on <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1kvJpyBpEWPxE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a livestream</a> on Monday that a victory for Judge Crawford could help Democrats claw back two House seats in Wisconsin — a prospect also broached in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-race.html" title="">a January call that Judge Crawford participated in</a> with party donors.</p><p>“There are gerrymandered congressional lines right now in Wisconsin,” Mr. Jeffries said. “We need to be able to revisit that and have fair lines. The only way for that to be even a significant possibility is if you have an enlightened Supreme Court.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Trump hosted a conference call for Judge Schimel’s supporters on Thursday night and reiterated the national implications for Republicans. The president said his agenda could be impeded if a liberal-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court redrew the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats.</p><p>“It’s a very important race, actually,” Mr. Trump said. “I know you feel it’s local, but it’s not. It’s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.”</p><p>Wisconsin Democrats, who had planned <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-race.html" title="">to try to make the election about abortion rights</a>, zeroed in on Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">the moment he began spending</a> on Judge Schimel’s behalf in February.</p><p>Judge Crawford made opposition to Mr. Musk a core part of her stump speeches and television advertising. A statewide tour was branded “The People v. Elon Musk.” And Judge Crawford’s allies rarely pass up a chance to remind voters that Tesla, the electric vehicle company controlled by Mr. Musk, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/elon-musk-tesla-wisconsin.html" title="">is suing Wisconsin</a> for the right to open dealerships there.</p><p>Wisconsin Democrats say that with Mr. Trump now a decade into his tenure as the chief boogeyman for liberals, it is helpful to have a new villain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“I see people who are only tangentially political posting selfies about how they’re knocking on doors,” said Kelda Roys, a Democratic state senator from Madison. “Now, people are paying attention, and now I’m seeing the type of awareness and attention that was missing earlier in the race.”</p><h2 id="link-58a4289d">An Avalanche of Money and Ads</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The race’s liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, a jurist in Dane County, Wis., has made opposition to Mr. Musk central to her campaign.

Nonstop ads on television and cellphones as well as constant mail and door-knocking have spurred early voting at a pace far exceeding the 2023 Supreme Court race, which at the time was the most expensive judicial campaign in American history.</p><p>This year’s contest could wind up costing nearly twice as much.</p><p>While voters uniformly say they dislike the barrage of political ads, an internal analysis from America Votes, one of the largest Democratic voter mobilization groups, found that in the first week of in-person early voting, turnout was twice what it was two years ago, largely because of increased Republican enthusiasm for the practice.</p><p>The America Votes memo, circulated among Wisconsin Democrats this week and obtained by The New York Times, concluded that Judge Crawford probably had a lead of eight percentage points among the 500,000 votes that had been cast. But it warned that Judge Schimel was likely to win among Election Day voters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“Elon Musk, the disdain for what he’s doing at the federal level, is helping to fuel the fire,” said David Crowley, the Democratic executive of Milwaukee County. “There are things happening at the federal level that we can combat next week.”</p><h2 id="link-215573ca">Don’t Forget About the Candidates</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Judge Crawford has long gone out of her way to present herself as an unassuming candidate, and even before ascending to the bench was judicious in voicing her personal politics.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jim Vondruska for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>With all the focus on Mr. Musk, the actual candidates have fallen a little under the radar.</p><p>Judge Crawford has gone out of her way to present herself as an unassuming candidate in the mold of Senator Tammy Baldwin — the third-term Democrat from Wisconsin who has never lost an election.</p><p>Even before ascending to the bench in 2018, Judge Crawford was judicious about voicing her personal politics. Buried in a 263-page Republican opposition research document on her was the fact that she did not sign petitions to recall Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, in 2012. At the time, the recall, which eventually failed, was a cause célèbre for Wisconsin Democrats.</p><p>Judge Schimel, a former state attorney general, has been a bit more colorful. His fondness for Mr. Trump is such that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/brad-schimel-trump-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">he dressed up as him last Halloween</a>, and this month he posed with a 50-foot inflatable version of the president. Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/us/politics/trump-schimel-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">endorsed him last weekend</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Mr. Walker, in an interview this week from aboard Judge Schimel’s campaign bus, predicted that Democrats’ focus on Mr. Musk would boomerang to benefit Judge Schimel. “The more they’re attacking the president or even Elon Musk, they energize their base, but that base is already pumped up,” Mr. Walker said.</p><p>But attacks on Mr. Musk, he said, are also exciting Republican voters looking for a way to defend the president: “The more you elevate the race and make the connection to Trump, since there’s such a personal affinity a lot of these voters have for the president, the better the odds become.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Reid J.
