Britain, he said, would finance the massive new expenditure by scaling back spending on development.</p><p>The Labour government had previously promised to raise expenditure to 2.5 percent of economic output, from a current level of 2.3 percent, but had not given a date by which it would do so. The move would amount to an increase in expenditure of 13.4 billion pounds ($17 billion) a year on defense between now and 2027. </p><p>“We must change our national security posture because a generational challenge demands a generational response,” Mr. Starmer said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Starmer said the change would be funded by cutting overseas development aid from 0.5 percent of gross domestic product to 0.3 percent, adding that he regretted the reduction. “At times like this, the defense and security of the British people must always come first,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Trump has long demanded that European allies contribute more to Europe’s defense. NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, recently called on NATO members to spend “considerably more” than 3 percent of economic output on defense.</p><p>Mr. Starmer reiterated the centrality of NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance to Europe’s security. That drew a distinction with the likely new chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Merz, who said after his party’s election victory on Sunday that Europe would have to stake out a security strategy independent of the United States.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
