But to the more than 300 people in attendance, who were mostly Jewish, he was a rock star. He was the kid who got into Harvard, made his parents proud and then exposed antisemitism from inside the ivory tower.</p><p>At the event, a scholarship ceremony in Lake Success, N.Y., for high school students fighting injustice, Mr. Kestenbaum would be speaking about antisemitism at Harvard, next to a survivor of genocide in Rwanda. “You’re the Harvard guy?” a rabbi asked him. “Don’t hold it against me,” Mr. Kestenbaum replied.</p><p>Over the last year and a half, Mr. Kestenbaum, a 26-year-old Orthodox Jew from the Bronx, has become the face of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html" title="">Republican-led campaign against antisemitism</a> in America’s top universities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>His determination to battle his alma mater in court helped build momentum for the Trump administration to challenge what it calls the “ideological capture” driving college campuses to the political left.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kestenbaum spoke at an event in April at the Fresh Meadow Country Club in Lake Success, N.Y.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jackie Molloy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Kestenbaum has documented his unlikely trajectory on social media, with photos of himself with President Trump and other politicians.</p><p>He was a second-year student at Harvard Divinity School when protests over the war in Gaza broke out on campus. A former high school debate captain, he took naturally to appearing in news reports as a conservative student voice and joined a round table of students in Washington to discuss antisemitism at universities.</p><p>In May 2024, he graduated from the divinity school. And then in July, he was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In the months since, Mr. Kestenbaum’s agenda for higher education has become nearly identical to Mr. Trump’s. To root out antisemitism, Mr. Kestenbaum believes schools should have, among other things, stronger disciplinary measures against protesters who violate the law or university policy; reform of curriculum that he says amounts to left-wing indoctrination; and the deportation of international students who have broken the law.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kestenbaum, right, with President Trump last year at Ohel Chabad-Lubavitch in New York City.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Kestenbaum said he had wealthy patrons who were helping finance his litigation, though he would not reveal their identities. He casually mentioned that he spoke “with the guys on DOGE,” or the Department of Government Efficiency, a group that Elon Musk has led to reduce the size and spending of the federal government.</p><p>“They reached out to me, and I’m going to sound braggadocious, but I’m active in this space,” he said in one of several conversations with The New York Times. “I was more than happy to help.”</p><p>In January 2024, he was among six Jewish students at Harvard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/us/harvard-antisemitism-lawsuit.html" title="">who sued the university</a>, accusing it of becoming “a bastion of rampant anti-Jewish hatred and harassment.” The case was settled, the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, but Mr. Kestenbaum refused to join the settlement. He broke off on his own and continued to litigate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>His lawsuit describes a poisonous atmosphere at Harvard. As an example, he cited in court papers a social media message that taunted a “pro-genocide sophomore” who “looks just as dumb as her nose is crooked.” </p><p>His complaint said that Harvard ignored his many, increasingly angry reports that pro-Palestinian activists were harassing Jewish students. It also said that he was stalked on campus by protesters who were trying to intimidate him, and that he was kicked off a divinity school WhatsApp group chat for his views.</p><p>Harvard declined to comment on Mr. Kestenbaum’s claims. But its lawyers said in court documents that the university “has not been, nor will it ever be, deliberately indifferent” to complaints of antisemitism.</p><p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/harvard-antisemitism-islamophobia-reports.html" title="">the school published two reports</a>, totaling about 500 pages, documenting widespread antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus and proposing reforms. The report on Islamophobia said that Arab, Muslim and Palestinian students had also reported experiencing harassment, such as being called slurs like “terrorist” and “towelhead.” These students and faculty members said they felt they could not freely express their political opinions on campus, according to the report.</p><p>The two reports were accompanied by a letter from Harvard’s president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/us/harvard-alan-garber-trump-administration.html" title="">Alan Garber</a>, apologizing for not having done more to protect students.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But protesters and free speech advocates have said that efforts to stop antisemitism on campuses have often been too heavy-handed. They argue that the definition of antisemitism that Harvard uses, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/harvard-antisemitism-definition-discipline.html?timespastHighlight=Kestenbaum" title="">it recently adopted</a> as part of the settlement of the first lawsuit that Mr. Kestenbaum was a part of, is so broad that it has been used to crack down on pro-Palestinian speech.</p><p>Mr. Kestenbaum has not always identified with conservative causes. He registered as a Democrat when he turned 18 and supported Bernie Sanders. But like some other lifelong Democrats who are Jews, he shifted right after the campus protests.</p><p>While some Democrats view Republican calls to fight antisemitism skeptically, Mr. Kestenbaum said that this was not the time to shrink from “making a fuss,” and that he was willing to speak aloud what many Jews believe but keep to themselves.</p><p>“Shabbos Kestenbaum has given voice to the anger, horror and indignation that is felt by a large number of people,” said Kenneth Marcus, the chief executive of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, which fights antisemitism on campuses. The group had separately sued Harvard and settled.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Kestenbaum enrolled in Harvard’s divinity school in 2022, where he said he stood out for being an Orthodox Jew.

In two weeks, he will speak in Amsterdam.</p><p>And on Thursday, he was at the White House, in the Rose Garden, as Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing the Religious Liberty Commission during a National Day of Prayer event. Mr. Kestenbaum said he spoke to Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, about expediting the deportation of international students who broke the law and took a selfie.</p><p>Some believe his activism is both sincere and opportunistic.</p><p>After the Republican convention, Shaul Magid, a visiting professor of modern Judaism at the divinity school, wrote a gentle rebuke of Mr. Kestenbaum in The Crimson, the student paper at Harvard. “The fact that Kestenbaum, who knows my leftist views on Israel, chose to speak at the R.N.C. after sitting in my classroom for a year, demonstrates that professors don’t indoctrinate,” Dr. Magid wrote. “They encourage independent thought.”</p><p>In an interview, Dr. Magid said that he and Mr. Kestenbaum had been “pretty close.” He agreed that there were problems with how the divinity school and the university dealt with the protests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“But I think that he was exaggerating the situation,” he said. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“They reached out to me,” Mr. Kestenbaum said of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team known as DOGE, “and I’m going to sound braggadocious, but I’m active in this space.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jackie Molloy for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Mr. Kestenbaum, the sixth of seven children, said he comes from an outsider background. His parents, a rare book dealer and an early childhood educator, are British immigrants, and at the divinity school, he said, he stood out for being an Orthodox Jew. The school held community tea once a week, he said, “and there was never any kosher food.”</p><p>“Being an Orthodox Jew who supported the land of Israel as a religious mandate was something that was never once accepted,” he added.</p><p>One of his favorite professors was David Wolpe, a prominent rabbi from Los Angeles who was a visiting scholar. Rabbi Wolpe caused a stir by resigning from a Harvard advisory panel on antisemitism, saying he did not feel he could make a difference.</p><p>He applauded his former student for sticking to his cause. “He was uncompromising and unstinting in calling out what was going on,” Rabbi Wolpe said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Mr. Kestenbaum relishes his new role — the travel, the people, the sense of higher purpose.

A doormat is inscribed “Welcome to Joe and Kami’s House,” referring to the family’s cats, Joe and Kamala. The family adopted and named them as “good luck charms” before the 2020 election, Mr. Kestenbaum said.</p><p>Asked what kind of career his advocacy might lead to, he suggested perhaps a role in public policy.</p><p>For now, he is planning to move to Los Angeles for a job at PragerU, a nonprofit “hub for pro-American content online,” according to its website. In the role, he said he will preach ideas like “the importance of religion, the importance of free market capitalism, the importance of holding institutions of higher learning accountable.” He hopes to reach the next generation of conservatives.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Anemona Hartocollis is a national reporter for The Times, covering higher education.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/harvard-university">Harvard University</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Education in America</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Alan Garber and President Trump:</strong> Harvard’s president became a hero to liberals after Harvard resisted the federal government.
