But the scars of its impact are impossible to miss.</p><p>More than 130,000 people, according to the Russian authorities, have fled border areas or been evacuated from them since Ukrainian forces began their incursion on Aug. 6. Many have found themselves in this regional capital, a city of about a half-million.</p><p>During a recent visit, people awaited in long lines for help with accommodation and other basic necessities like blankets. They jostled for position and sometimes shoved, but they did not move when sirens wailed repeatedly, warning of a potential drone or missile attack.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/multimedia/16russia-kursk-02-khbp/16russia-kursk-02-khbp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/multimedia/16russia-kursk-02-khbp/16russia-kursk-02-khbp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/multimedia/16russia-kursk-02-khbp/16russia-kursk-02-khbp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A large building with blown-out windows and piles of debris around it." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/multimedia/16russia-kursk-02-khbp/16russia-kursk-02-khbp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/multimedia/16russia-kursk-02-khbp/16russia-kursk-02-khbp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/multimedia/16russia-kursk-02-khbp/16russia-kursk-02-khbp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/16/multimedia/16russia-kursk-02-khbp/16russia-kursk-02-khbp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="429"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A building that was damaged by falling missile debris in Kursk.

It will be very difficult to wash away this hate.”</p><p>As for himself, he said, because of the incursion he would probably sign another military contract.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A memorial park for soldiers killed in World War II is now also a cemetery for soldiers from Kursk who have been killed in Russia’s war in Ukraine since 2022.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nanna Heitmann is a member of Magnum Photos and freelance photographer for The Times.
