    <h1>At Funeral in Turkey, Family Mourns American Activist Aysenur Eygi</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Turkey’s president, Mr. Erdogan, said on Monday that his country would seek to add her killing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/middleeast/icj-israel-genocide-ruling.html" title="">a genocide case against Israel</a> at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. After Ms. Eygi’s body arrived in Turkey on Friday, Turkey performed an autopsy before transporting it to Didim.</p><p>Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-icj-genocide.html" title="">rejected accusations of genocide</a>, saying it is defending itself after the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 that killed an estimated 1,200 people.</p><p>Ms. Eygi’s death came as international criticism of Israel’s handling of the war in Gaza has been rising. More that 41,000 people have been killed, according to the Gazan health ministry, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.</p><p>Airstrikes continued into Saturday, with Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency, reporting that 10 people, including women and children, had been killed in a strike that hit a home in Gaza City, among other deaths in the enclave. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.</p><p>Friends and relatives of Ms. Egyi recalled her as passionate about standing up for people she considered to be victims of injustice.</p><p>That conviction fueled her involvement, often with socialist groups, in activism in Mexico, Myanmar, Australia and Seattle. In the winter of 2016-2017, she camped out with other activists in North Dakota to protest the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/us/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-battle-whos-fighting-and-why.html" title="">Dakota Access Pipeline</a>, which was slated to run near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.</p><p>She also became a fervent supporter of the Palestinians, which drove her to travel to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to join protests against Israeli settlements there.</p><p>“She was an outlier,” her cousin, Sercan Eygi, 28, said in an interview after the funeral. “Most activists don’t even bother moving apart from their safe zone.”</p><p>Ms. Eygi had been in Turkey before traveling to the West Bank and had told her relatives that she was going to Jordan, which is much safer, Mr. Eygi said. When they discovered through social media where she actually was, Mr. Eygi called her.</p><p>“I asked her not to die,” he recalled telling her. “She said, I’ll try my best.”</p><p>She was shot the next day.</p><p>He was at work in Portugal, where he lives, when a colleague told him an American activist of Turkish descent had been killed in the West Bank. He asked for the name, learned that his cousin was gone and had to inform other relatives, he said.</p><p>The Turkish government had helped the family, he said, and he was glad that it was pushing for accountability. He did not feel the same about the United States.</p><p>“I honestly think the U.S. government is trying to do the least reaction possible,” he said.</p><p>Ms. Egyi’s father said that he had not received even a condolence call from an American official.</p><p>“The Turkish government is following the case,” he said, adding, “I hope the U.S. government will do the same.”</p><p>An official from the U.S. Embassy in Ankara said that the U.S. government had been helping the family since Ms. Eygi’s death.</p><p>“From the moment of this horrific tragedy, our consular teams — first in Jerusalem and then in Ankara — have been in touch with family members and offering consular services,” he official said. “Our posts overseas have no higher priority than U.S. citizens, and Aysenur Eygi was a U.S. citizen.”</p><p>Many mourners on Saturday had not known Ms. Eygi but had been moved by accounts of her life and death.</p><p>In the crowd outside the mosque, Semanur Sonmez Yaman, 50, said she had come from Istanbul to pay her respects because Ms. Eygi had “stood up to persecution.”</p><p>More than 11 months of war in Gaza and so many deaths had left her with “a feeling of desperation,” she said, but added that Ms. Eygi had encouraged her.</p><p>“Of course the death is very painful, but someone from Turkey dying there doing something good gives me a type of serenity,” she said.</p><p>Safak Timur<!-- --> contributed reporting from Istanbul.</p></div></div>
