data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>With Turkish flags flying and chants of “God is great” resounding through the cemetery, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a Turkish American activist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-activist-shooting.html" title="">killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank</a>, was laid to rest on Saturday in a town near Turkey’s Aegean coast.</p><p>Although she moved to the United States as a toddler, acquired citizenship and spent most of her life there, the funeral for Ms. Eygi, 26, was deeply Turkish, and profoundly pro-Palestinian.</p><p>Hundreds of people, many carrying Palestinian flags and wearing Palestinian scarves, gathered at the central mosque in the town of Didim to say prayers for her, including senior Turkish officials. No American officials attended, and there was not an American flag in sight.</p><p>In the 11 months since the war in Gaza began, Ms. Eygi’s two countries have taken starkly different stances toward the conflict. The United States has stood by Israel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/world/middleeast/the-white-house-signals-long-term-support-for-israel-hoping-to-avert-a-regional-war.html" title="">continuing to supply its military</a> with bombs even as concerns about civilian deaths have mounted. Turkey, on the other hand, has embraced the Palestinians, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/world/middleeast/turkey-israel-erdogan.html" title="">decrying Israel’s conduct</a> and standing up for Hamas, which Israel, the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization.</p><p>Two relatives of Ms. Eygi said the American response to her killing had frustrated them. In an interview before her funeral, her father, also a U.S. citizen, said the United States had not stood up for her.</p><p>“I have been living in the U.S. for 25 years, and I know how seriously the U.S. looks out for the safety of its citizens abroad,” said her father, Mehmet Suat Eygi. “I know that when something happens, the U.S. will attack like the eagle on its seal. But when Israel is in question, it transforms into a dove.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mehmet Suat Eygi (rear right) father of Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26 year old from Seattle, in his home in the Turkish Aegean town of Didim.

The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-activist-shooting.html" title="">Israeli military has said</a> it is “highly likely” that she was hit “indirectly and unintentionally” and that the matter was still being investigated.</p><p>Other activists who were with her at the time said that she had been standing more than 200 yards away and downhill from the soldiers. They added that the protest, during which some demonstrators had thrown stones, had calmed down by the time she was shot.</p><p>Senior officials from both of Ms. Eygi’s countries — she was born in Turkey but obtained U.S. citizenship in 2005, her father said, and had lived in the Seattle area — have condemned her killing.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Tuesday <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-united-kingdom-foreign-secretary-david-lammy-joint-press-availability/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called the killing</a> “unprovoked and unjustified,” and on Wednesday, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-aysenur-eygi/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that he was “outraged and deeply saddened” by her death.</p><p>“There must be full accountability,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/world/middleeast/biden-israel-shooting-west-bank-activist.html" title="">Mr. Biden said</a>.</p><p>But addressing the mourners in Didim on Saturday, Numan Kurtulmus, the speaker of the Turkish Parliament, criticized not just Israel, but at the countries that support it.</p><p>“This is not only the crime of a few murderous Israeli soldiers,” he said. “This is also the crime of the collaborative states who have the back of that terrorist state.”</p><p>Underlining the extent to which Turkey had adopted her killing as a national cause, other officials who attended the funeral included the vice president; the justice, interior and foreign ministers; the head of the largest opposition party and a former prime minister.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mourners held Palestinian flags during the funeral of Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bradley Secker for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Her death came as international criticism of Israel’s handling of the war in Gaza has been rising. More that 41,000 people have been killed, according to the Gazan health ministry, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.</p><p>Airstrikes continued into Saturday, with Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency, reporting that 10 people, including women and children, had been killed in a strike that hit a home in Gaza City, among other deaths in the enclave. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.</p><p>Ms. Eygi’s body arrived in Turkey on Friday, where Turkey performed its own autopsy. The Turkish president, Mr. Erdogan, said on Monday that his country would pursue her case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</p><p>Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-icj-genocide.html" title="">rejected accusations of genocide</a>, saying it is defending itself after the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 that killed an estimated 1,200 people.</p><p>In Didim, a resort town near the Aegean coast where Ms. Eygi was to be buried, her father said that Turkey had taken a great interest in her case but that he had not received even a condolence call from any American official. An official from the U.S. Embassy in Ankara said that it had been providing consular assistance and had been in touch with Ms. Eygi’s family and with the Turkish authorities.</p><p>Mr. Eygi said, “The Turkish government is following the case,” adding, “I hope the U.S. government will do the same. An independent investigation is our biggest wish, but we don’t know how it can be done.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Hubbard is the Istanbul bureau chief, covering Turkey and the surrounding region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-hubbard">More about Ben Hubbard</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
