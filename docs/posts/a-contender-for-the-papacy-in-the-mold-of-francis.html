After he rose to be a bishop, he implied that he suffered from impostor syndrome. And when Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle of the Philippines is asked if he could become the first Asian pope — a frequent question in recent years — he says it is impossible.</p><p>“Thinking of myself in that position, no, no, I laugh at it,” Cardinal Tagle told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbqB3dKZgHM&amp;t=707s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the BBC</a> in 2015. “I cannot even manage my life. How can I manage a worldwide community?”</p><p>By then he had already been talked about as a potential replacement for Pope Benedict XVI. Now 67, Cardinal Tagle (pronounced TAG-leh) is once again on many unofficial short lists of “papabile” cardinals, or those with a good shot at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/next-pope-francis-candidates.html" title="">succeeding Pope Francis</a>. The most prominent candidate from Asia, his election would be an emphatic marker of the Roman Catholic Church’s shift away from Europe to Africa and Asia, where it <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2024-04/vatican-central-statistical-office-church-pontifical-yearbook.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">continues to grow</a>.</p><p>Francis was the only pope in the modern era who was born outside Europe. If Cardinal Tagle ascends to the papacy, he would be the first Asian pontiff in modern times. (Several popes in antiquity were from Syria, which is technically in West Asia, though it is now considered part of the Middle East.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At the Vatican, Cardinal Tagle oversees missionary work. Widely known by his nickname “Chito,” he is often called the <a href="https://cruxnow.com/church/2015/01/manila-cardinal-luis-tagle-the-asian-pope-francis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Asian Francis”</a> for his ability to connect with the poor, his call for action against climate change and his criticism of the “harsh” stance adopted by Catholic clerics toward gay people, divorced people and unwed mothers. He is popular for his humility, and his homilies have drawn the faithful to the pews and to Facebook streams.</p><p>But as leader of the church in the Philippines, he was criticized by activists and fellow priests as being timid about the scourge of clerical sex abuse. Those complaints continued as his profile in the church rose. Last month, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, an advocacy group, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/67f051268ff9667a0f3091d2/t/67f4db2725ccf900c637fdeb/1744100137904/Tagle_VELM+Complaint_3.25.25.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged the Vatican</a> to investigate Cardinal Tagle’s conduct in relation to cases of alleged clerical abuse in the Central African Republic and New Zealand. (The group also sought inquiries into five other cardinals.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pope Francis with Cardinal Tagle in 2013.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tiziana Fabi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Separately, in 2022, Pope Francis removed the entire management team of Caritas Internationalis, the Vatican’s charitable arm, including Cardinal Tagle, who served as president.

Some Vatican insiders see Cardinal Pablo Virgilio Siongco David, who has a lower profile, as a potential pope as well.</p><p>When the Philippine legislature proposed a bill to make it easier to access contraception, Cardinal Tagle called on lawmakers to reject it.

But he has also said that survivors should seek justice through the church’s canonical process because “the victims, once exposed to the public, might also be shamed.” The church, he said, should also care for “the abuser, who is definitely lost.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“This is a very Asian approach,” he told the Union Catholic Asian News in 2013, “and that approach leads to healing.” </p><p>“The sad thing is that Cardinal Tagle is very much out of touch with the realities facing the sexual abuse of children by priests and brothers,” said the Rev. Shay Cullen, an Irish priest working in the Philippines. He said the cardinal had told him the church was more concerned about matters like divorce.</p><p>Cardinal Tagle’s approach has contributed to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/world/asia/philippines-catholic-priests-abuse.html" title="">culture of impunity in the church in the Philippines</a>, according to a watchdog group, BishopAccountability.org.</p><p>Cardinal Tagle has acknowledged being criticized for “not being strong, that I don’t condemn enough,” but he said he took heart from Francis’s example, according to a <a href="https://cruxnow.com/church/2015/01/manila-cardinal-luis-tagle-the-asian-pope-francis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2015 interview with Crux</a>, a publication specializing in the Catholic Church. “Who am I to judge?” he said, repeating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/world/europe/pope-francis-gay-priests.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20someone%20is%20gay%20and,the%20English%20word%20%E2%80%9Cgay.%E2%80%9D" title="">Francis’s position on gay priests</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Born in Manila, Cardinal Tagle was raised in the city of Imus by parents who worked in a bank.
