Tens of thousands of residents were being transferred to safety while dozens were being treated for injuries.</p><p>At least 126 people have died and 188 were injured in the quake, which struck on Tuesday morning in Dingri County, near one of Tibet’s most historic cities, in western China, state media reported. The quake was China’s deadliest since December 2023, when 151 people were killed in a magnitude 6.2 temblor in the northwestern provinces of Gansu and Qinghai.</p><p>The area has since recorded more than 600 aftershocks, some exceeding a magnitude of 4.0, Chinese state media said. Survivors and rescuers have had to brave freezing temperatures, as the mercury dropped to a low of minus 18 degrees Celsius or 0 Fahrenheit at night. Recent aerial images near the epicenter showed frozen lake surfaces, and temperatures are expected to remain low for the next three days, which could narrow the window for rescuing survivors.</p><p>The true extent of the damage was hard to determine independently. Tibet is one of the most inaccessible and underdeveloped parts of China. Security has been heightened for decades because of tensions between Beijing and Tibetans, many of whom have struggled to maintain their cultural identity and religious traditions in a country dominated by Han Chinese. Foreign journalists are forbidden from traveling independently in the region.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Much of the relief effort is focused on warding off the cold. The state broadcaster showed video footage of rescuers setting up tents draped with an insulated layer and rigging them with light panels powered by generators as displaced residents draped in blankets huddled on cots and chairs.</p><p>Zhang Guoqing, the vice premier, visited hospitals and tent camps on Monday night. He instructed rescue teams to focus on finding remaining survivors, delivering medical care for the infirm, and ensuring that the displaced have enough food and warmth to survive the frigid winter.</p><p>Rescuers have pulled out more than 400 survivors from the rubble overnight. About 46,000 people were relocated to safety.</p><p>Chinese state media reported that road obstructions have been cleared, and electricity has resumed in most surrounding towns and villages. The state broadcaster showed footage of soldiers digging through rubble with gloved hands and shovels.</p><p>Li You<!-- --> contributed research in Beijing.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tiffany May is a reporter based in Hong Kong, covering the politics, business and culture of the city and the broader region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/tiffany-may">More about Tiffany May</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
