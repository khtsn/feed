Instead, government officials accused the school of not resolving the “pervasive race discrimination and antisemitic harassment” they described as “plaguing” the campus in Cambridge, Mass.</p><p>“There is a dark problem on Harvard’s campus, and by prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school’s claim to taxpayer support,” the task force said.</p><p>The task force did not detail which grants were being canceled, though it said eight federal agencies were involved in cutting off money. The officials said the $450 million in cuts were on top of $2.2 billion the administration had already frozen.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A Harvard spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>The government has been at odds with Harvard since late March, when the task force said it would review about $9 billion in federal money designated for the university and its affiliates. Harvard later rejected a list of intrusive demands from the federal government and filed a lawsuit to challenge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html" title="">the suspension of the $2.2 billion in multiyear grants</a>.</p><p>Last week, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, told Harvard not to apply for future federal grants. In a response on Monday, Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, said the university and the Trump administration shared “common ground on a number of critical issues, including the importance of ending antisemitism and other bigotry on campus.”</p><p>But, he warned, shared ambitions were “undermined and threatened by the federal government’s overreach into the constitutional freedoms of private universities and its continuing disregard of Harvard’s compliance with the law.”</p><p>The Trump administration’s battle with Harvard has become the focal point of its efforts to realign what it views as the liberal tilt of elite universities. The result has been a widening effort to open a series of investigations after the college refused to comply with President Trump’s demands.</p><p>In late April, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025.04.25-Commissioner-Charge-Against-Harvard-University.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened an investigation</a> into whether Harvard and its affiliates had discriminated against white, Asian, male and heterosexual applicants and training program participants. The Washington Free Beacon first reported that investigation on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The university is also under scrutiny from the Education Department and the Health and Human Services Department, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/us/politics/harvard-dei-law-review.html" title="">investigating</a> the use of racial preferences at the Harvard Law Review.</p><p>The Trump administration has accused Harvard of failing to report large foreign donations to the federal government as required by law.</p><p>The Education Department has accused Harvard of submitting incomplete financial disclosures about its foreign ties and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/trump-harvard-foreign-donations.html" title="">ordered</a> the university to provide a trove of related documents. The Department of Homeland Security has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html" title="">threatened</a> to block Harvard from enrolling international students unless the school hands over detailed records about the student body.</p><p>Harvard has disputed the notion that the university had not been complying with the law.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html" title="">threatened</a> to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status, a move that the school argued had no legal basis.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael C.
