One of the men, they said, had recently pledged allegiance to the Islamic State online and had focused on the Eras Tour as a potential target.</p><p>Nearly 200,000 people had been expected to attend the Vienna concerts, which were to start on Aug. 8.</p><p>In her social media post published on Wednesday, Ms. Swift said she was grateful to the authorities, “because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>“I decided that all of my energy had to go toward helping to protect the nearly half a million people I had coming to see the shows in London,” she said of the next stop <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/arts/music/taylor-swift-london-eras-tour-security.html?region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_top_links_recirc&amp;name=styln-taylor-swift-attack&amp;parentUri=nyt%3A%2F%2Farticle%2Fbbfe3f9f-71b5-5866-ae83-ff98e3eb8ed8&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;variant=show" title="">on her tour.</a> “My team and I worked hand in hand with stadium staff and British authorities every day in pursuit of that goal, and I want to thank them for everything they did for us.”</p><p>“Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows,” she continued. “In cases like this one, ‘silence’ is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it’s right to. My priority was finishing our European tour safely, and it is with great relief that I can say we did that.”</p><p>Thousands of fans who had been eager to spend a few hours with Ms. Swift in Vienna — including many who traveled great distances to see her — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/world/europe/taylor-swift-eras-tour-vienna-reactions.html" title="">shed tears over the canceled concerts</a>.
