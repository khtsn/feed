    <h1>Houthi Missile Hits Near Tel Aviv Airport</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an urgent meeting of his security cabinet on Sunday and Israel Katz, the country’s defense minister, suggested that there would be a harsh response.</p><p>“Whoever harms us will be harmed by us sevenfold,” Mr. Katz said in a statement after the attack.</p><p>The Houthi militia began firing missiles at Israel more than a year ago in solidarity with Hamas, the Iran-backed group in the Gaza Strip. It has stepped up its attacks since Israel ended a cease-fire in its war in Gaza in mid-March.</p><p>Sunday’s missile attack, which struck at the start of the workweek in Israel, was the fourth by the Houthis targeting Israel over the past 48 hours. The other three were intercepted.</p><p>Israel’s Arrow aerial defense system, which is able to hit targets high in the atmosphere or beyond the atmosphere, has been successful in thwarting many long-range missile attacks. In October, the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-thaad-missile-defense.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">sent Israel a THAAD advanced missile defense system</a> to assist in fending off attacks by Iran and its allies.</p><p>But by slipping through all the defenses, the strike on Sunday near the airport represented one the biggest successes for the Houthis in recent months — and one of the most serious failures for Israel.</p></div></div>
