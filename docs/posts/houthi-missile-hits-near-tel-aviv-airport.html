international airport close to Tel Aviv on Sunday, after the military failed to intercept the projectile seemingly aimed at one of the country’s most sensitive locations.</p><p>The strike, carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, resulted in a temporary suspension of flights. There were no immediate reports of fatalities.</p><p>Israel’s military said that several efforts were made to intercept the missile and that an impact was identified in the area of Ben Gurion Airport. The military added that the episode was under review.</p><p>The Magen David Adom emergency ambulance service said it was treating four people who were mildly or moderately injured by the blast, and two others who were injured while running for shelter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an urgent consultation of his security cabinet on Sunday, and Israel Katz, the country’s defense minister, suggested that there would be a harsh response.</p><p>“Whoever harms us will be harmed by us sevenfold,” Mr. Katz said in a statement after the attack.</p><p>The Houthi militia began firing missiles at Israel more than a year ago in solidarity with Hamas, the Iran-backed group in the Gaza Strip. It has stepped up its attacks since Israel ended a cease-fire in Gaza in mid-March.</p><p>Sunday’s missile, which struck at the start of the workweek in Israel, was the fourth by the Houthis targeting Israel over the past 48 hours. The other three were intercepted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The authorities inspecting a crater near a road outside of the airport.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Israel’s Arrow aerial-defense system, which is able to hit targets high in the atmosphere or beyond the atmosphere, has been successful in thwarting many long-range missile attacks. In October, the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-thaad-missile-defense.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">sent Israel a THAAD advanced missile defense system</a> to assist in fending off attacks by Iran and its allies.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But by slipping through all of the defenses, the strike near the airport was one the biggest successes for the Houthis in recent months — and one of the most serious failures for Israel.</p><p>The Houthi military spokesman, Yahya Saree, claimed responsibility for targeting the airport and, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbikotoJiNo&amp;t=23s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a video statement</a>, warned international airlines to stay away from Ben Gurion for their own safety.</p><p>Hamas praised the missile attack, which came hours after Israel’s military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/middleeast/israel-mobilizes-reservists-gaza.html" title="">announced that it would mobilize thousands of additional reserve soldiers</a> to bolster its campaign in Gaza.</p><p>More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, according to health officials in the enclave, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The war began after Hamas led an attack on Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.</p><p>Israel says its military operations in Gaza are aimed at destroying Hamas and pressuring the group into freeing dozens of captives still held there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In recent months, Israel had refrained from striking back at the Houthis in Yemen as the United States intensified attacks targeting the group. Since the fall of 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/houthi-yemen-red-sea-attacks.html" title="">the Houthis have repeatedly attacked</a> commercial and naval ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in support, they say, of Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza.</p><p>After Sunday’s strike near the airport, Israel’s opposition leaders took the government to task for failing to stop the missiles that have set off sirens across the country and sent millions of civilians rushing into bomb shelters, often in the middle of the night.</p><p>Benny Gantz, a former Israeli military chief and now the leader of a centrist opposition party, urged Mr. Netanyahu’s government to “wake up” and retaliate against Iran, even as the Trump administration is negotiating with Tehran over curbing its nuclear program.</p><p>“This isn’t Yemen — this is Iran” Mr. Gantz said in a statement <a href="https://x.com/gantzbe/status/1918920521070067850" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on social media. “Iran is the one firing ballistic missiles at the state of Israel, and it must bear the responsibility for that.”</p><p>Videos and images posted on social media on Sunday showed a large plume of dark smoke rising from an open area near Terminal 3 at the airport, the main international terminal, as sirens wailed and people ran for cover.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Large missile fragments could be seen on the ground outside the entrance to the building, and a road near the airport appeared to be covered in dirt and shrapnel. Footage on social media showed the police gathered in a muddy field nearby inspecting a large, deep crater.</p><p>In a statement shortly before the missile attack, the Israel Airport Authority said that 422 flights were scheduled to arrive or depart on Sunday. After the strike, the airport authority said flights were suspended according to protocol. The airport began functioning again soon after, but some international airlines canceled flights.</p><p>Myra Noveck<!-- -->, <!-- -->Adam Rasgon<!-- --> and <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, has been reporting on Israeli and Palestinian affairs since 1990.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza">The Israel Hamas War</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
