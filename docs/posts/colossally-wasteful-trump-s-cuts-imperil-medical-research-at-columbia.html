Pediatricians tracking the long-term health of children born to mothers infected with the coronavirus during pregnancy. Scientists searching for links between diabetes and dementia.</p><p>All these projects at Columbia University were paid for with federal research grants that were abruptly terminated following the Trump administration’s decision to cut $400 million in funding to Columbia over concerns regarding the treatment of Jewish students.</p><p>Dozens of medical and scientific studies<strong> </strong>are ending, or at risk of ending, leaving researchers scrambling to find alternative funding. In some cases, researchers have already started informing study subjects that research is suspended.</p><p>“Honestly, I wanted to cry,” said Kathleen Graham, a 56-year-old nurse in the Bronx, upon learning that the diabetes study she had participated in for a quarter of a century<strong> </strong>was ending.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At Columbia’s medical school, doctors said they were in shock as they received notice that their funding was terminated. Some expressed resignation, while others sought a stopgap solution and asked whether the university could fund some of the staff on the projects in the short term, according to interviews with five doctors or professors who had been affected.</p><p>“The most immediate need is to bridge in the short term and figure out what the longer-term plans are,” said Dr. Dawn Hershman, the interim chief the division of hematology and oncology at Columbia’s medical school. “That’s what is being worked out.”</p><p><a href="https://x.com/NIH/status/1899196680270238173" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">About $250 million of the $400 million</a> in cuts imposed this month involved funding from the National Institutes of Health. Each year, the N.I.H. distributes billions of dollars in research funding to universities for biomedical and behavioral research. Those grants are a major engine of medical progress — and, for many scientists and medical researchers, of successful careers.</p><p>In interviews, several Columbia researchers who received grant cancellation notices during the past week and a half said they assumed that their canceled grants were part of the $400 million in cuts that the Trump administration had announced. But they said they had no way of knowing just yet — a reflection of the chaos and uncertainty engulfing labs and clinics across the nation.</p><p>Last year, Columbia became the epicenter of a national student protest movement against the war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators established an encampment on campus and occupied a university building. Some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/nyregion/columbia-protests-antisemitism.html" title="">Jewish students said they experienced harassment</a> walking around or <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/content/sites/default/files/content/about/Task%20Force%20on%20Antisemitism/Report-2-Task-Force-on-Antisemitism.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">near campus, or were ostracized</a>. The university president requested that the Police Department clear out the demonstrators and later resigned amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/columbia-president-nemat-shafik-resigns.html" title="">fury over her handling of the divided campus</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Trump administration has blamed Columbia University, saying it did too little. Invoking federal anti-discrimination law, it has cut research funding to Columbia.</p><p>In addition to cutting research grants, the Trump administration has removed funding for clinical fellowships for early career doctors who were developing a specialty in oncology and several other fields. Other grants eliminated money for hiring research nurses and other support staff needed for clinical trials, Dr. Hershman said.</p><p>The sudden, deep cuts appear to be exceedingly rare, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-administration-says-columbia-u-s-federal-funding-at-risk-over-protest-response" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if not unprecedented</a>. Some legal scholars say that the administration’s tactics might violate the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/nyregion/columbia-trump-administration-funding-fight.html" title="">First Amendment and that the government appears to have ignored</a> the procedures and restrictions laid out in the same anti-discrimination law it has cited. Since announcing the cuts, the Trump administration has demanded that Columbia make dramatic changes to student discipline and put an academic department in receivership as a precondition to negotiations “regarding Columbia University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government,” according <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/14/nyregion/columbia-letter.html" title="">to a letter sent Thursday</a> by federal officials.</p><p>The cuts will be felt most immediately by research scientists and doctors, many of whom work mainly at Columbia’s medical school and affiliated hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, some 50 blocks north of Columbia’s main campus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In interviews, they expressed shock and sadness that their research projects were cut so abruptly. Dr. Olajide A. Williams, a neurologist and professor at Columbia’s medical school, had two grants that were terminated this month.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Olajide A.

Another grant explored how to increase screenings for colorectal cancer — which is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/well/colon-cancer-symptoms-treatment.html" title="">rising among younger adults</a> — across New York City.</p><p>“As I sit here trying to do this work, I truly believe to right a wrong with another wrong frays the fabric of justice,” said Dr. Williams. “Fighting the horrors of antisemitism by punishing the nobility of health disparities research creates a cycle of injustice that causes pain on all sides.”</p><p>He said he was stunned.</p><p>“Right now, I’m sitting in that pain trying to navigate the reality of what just happened to my grant portfolio,” he said.</p><p>More than 400 grants to Columbia University were terminated, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some of the grant cancellations will be felt far beyond Columbia. Large-scale studies can involve researchers at several universities, but, for administrative ease, the grant is linked to a single university. As a result, the cuts jeopardized some research projects involving numerous universities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Last week Dr. David M. Nathan, a Harvard Medical School professor, learned that funding for the diabetes research project — following a group of 1,700 people over more than 25 years — had been cut.</p><p>“The funding flows through Columbia, which is why we were vulnerable,” Dr. Nathan said. “When the N.I.H, or whoever made this decision, decided to target Columbia’s funding, we were just kind of swept up in this.”</p><p>That research project had grown out of a landmark study that demonstrated the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and the medication metformin at reducing Type 2 diabetes. Those findings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/09/us/diet-and-exercise-are-found-to-cut-diabetes-by-over-half.html" title="">were released in 2001</a>. Dr. Nathan and others followed the same participants over the next quarter-century. The latest phase, which was funded through Columbia, searched for links between diabetes and dementia.</p><p>Ms. Graham, the nurse in the Bronx, said that as part of that study, she had recently undergone tests and had her gait analyzed for early signs of any neurological problems. Over the years, she said, she has taken pride in helping produce data underscoring the advice that she and other medical professionals give to patients with diabetes.</p><p>Dr. Nathan said that the latest phase was two years into a five-year study.</p><p>“This is also colossally wasteful,” he said. “We haven’t collected all the data we hoped to collect.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Dr. Jordan Orange, who heads the Department of Pediatrics at Columbia’s<strong> </strong>medical school, said one project that lost funding involved the search for a nasal spray that would <a href="https://www.pandemicpact.org/grants/P21977" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">block the entry of viruses</a> and reduce infections.</p><p>“How wonderful would it be if we had a nasal spray that could block viruses?” Dr. Orange said.</p><p>According to Lucky Tran, a spokesman for Columbia University Medical Center, other canceled studies include one focused on reducing maternal mortality in New York and another on treatments for chronic illnesses, including long Covid.</p><p>Last week, researchers were trying to catalog which research had lost funding and which projects survived. “We’re still in the process of trying to figure out all of the grants,” Dr. Hershman said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joseph Goldstein covers health care in New York for The Times, following years of criminal justice and police reporting.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joseph-goldstein">More about Joseph Goldstein</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
