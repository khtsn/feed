In Santiago, it knocked out traffic lights, stranded people in elevators and shut down the subway network.</p><p>Hours later, the government announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the regions affected by the outage. Schools in those regions will be closed on Wednesday, with about 300,000 students affected, officials said.</p><p>“Today has been a difficult day for millions of countrymen,” Gabriel Boric, the president, said at a news conference on Tuesday night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>By late Tuesday, power had been restored to about four million households, Mr. Boric said. But he warned that the recovery was slow and unstable, and the situation remained precarious.</p><p>He blamed the country’s power companies for allowing the outage to occur and for not restoring power earlier, adding, “This is outrageous.” The outage was caused by failure of a transmission system, officials said.</p><p>Soldiers and national police officers were sent to affected regions, officials said, and in Santiago, helicopters circled above the city.</p><p>Emergency services, hospitals, prisons and airports across the country were operating on backup electricity systems and generators, the national disaster agency said.</p><p>John Bartlett<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
