The economic agreement is intended to provide Ukraine with an implicit security arrangement while addressing President Trump’s concerns that the U.S. has provided Kyiv with a blank check.</p><p>“This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. “President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.”</p><p>He added: “And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington.
