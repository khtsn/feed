Hezbollah, which had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-ceasefire.html" title="">weakened, isolated and desperate for the war to end</a>, will move its fighters north. And the Lebanese Army announced today that it had dispatched some of its forces to the country’s south.</p><p>Still, questions remain about the durability of the truce. The Israeli military declared a curfew tonight in southern Lebanon and shelled two villages there, saying that it had identified a vehicle in “a zone prohibited for movement.” </p><p>In northern Israel, where tens of thousands of people fled to escape barrages of Hezbollah rockets and drones, there was no apparent rush back to the evacuated towns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Keith Kellogg in 2020</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3ffaa1e4">Trump picked an envoy for Russia and Ukraine</h2><p>Donald Trump announced today that Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who worked in the White House during Trump’s first term, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/trump-keith-kellogg-ukraine-russia.html" title="">would be his envoy to Russia and Ukraine</a>.
