Thirty-three prisoners were killed and 15 others wounded in a confrontation with guards trying to prevent detainees from fleeing, he said.</p><p>“Within the next few hours,” Mr. Rafael said, “150 of the escapees were recaptured by the authorities.”</p><p>Tensions escalated this week after the nation’s top court on Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/africa/mozambique-disputed-election-results-upheld-chapo.html" title="">upheld the result</a> of the election in favor of Daniel Chapo, the candidate for Frelimo, which has governed Mozambique since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The political unrest comes as the southern African country is working to recover from Cyclone Chido. Mozambique’s death toll from the storm has risen to 120 since it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/11/weather/chido-map-path-tracker.html" title="">made landfall</a> more than a week ago, according to the country’s National Institute for Natural Disasters.</p><p>The death toll has nearly quadrupled from initial reported figures as rescue workers reach isolated rural areas. Most of those who died were in the province of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/africa/cyclone-chido-death-toll-mozambique.html" title="">Cabo Delgado</a>, where hundreds of thousands of people had already fled their homes after years of attacks by an insurgent group backed by the Islamic State. The storm has affected more than 450,000 people in the country, the natural disaster institute said.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
