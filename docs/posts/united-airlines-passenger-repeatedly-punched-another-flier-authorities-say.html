Another passenger stepped in to pull Mr. Nelson off the victim, who has not been publicly identified, according to court documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is unclear what prompted the attack on the passenger. A lawyer for Mr. Nelson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Nelson did not appear to have any injuries, and there was no sign that the sleeping passenger hit him back in defense, according to the affidavit. Other passengers on the flight saw blood on a window and side of the plane, according to court documents.</p><p>The injured passenger was treated by a doctor on the flight for abrasions to his face and head, the affidavit states.</p><p>United Airlines said in a statement on Thursday that the flight, which was carrying 82 passengers and six crew members, had landed safely, and that paramedics and law enforcement officials promptly responded.</p><p>“Thanks to the quick action of our crew and customers,” the airline said, “one passenger was restrained after becoming physically aggressive toward another customer.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Nelson was charged with one felony count of assault by beating, striking and wounding, and he appeared in federal courtroom in Alexandria, Va., on Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge William B. Porter. As of Thursday, Mr. Nelson remained in custody and had not entered a plea.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday that it was investigating the attack.</p><p>The attack on Monday was one of more than 1,700 instances of unruly passengers that airlines have reported this year, according to the F.A.A.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jesus Jiménez covers breaking news, online trends and other subjects.
