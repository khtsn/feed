Members of the Liberal Party are expected to elect Mr. Trudeau’s successor by early March, and a general election is likely to take place a couple of months later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, as a new cabinet is sworn in last month in Ottawa.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cole Burston for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It seems lamentable that the timeline makes it impossible to implement any of these recommended safeguards,” said <a href="https://www.lakeheadu.ca/users/A/ralford/node/21753" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan Alford</a>, an associate law professor at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario. “Sadly and perhaps paradoxically, it’s going to reinforce the notion that the same attempts that occurred in the last two federal elections are inevitably going to take place in this election.”</p><p>The report’s release capped a yearlong public inquiry into foreign interference, which Mr. Trudeau’s government had fiercely opposed. It finally relented only after an extraordinary series of leaks to Canadian news outlets of intelligence reports that revealed Chinese meddling in the past two general elections, in 2021 and 2019.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Months of public hearings, as well as the sworn testimonies of witnesses and the release of intelligence reports, revealed how rising foreign powers — especially China and India — had tried to further their interests in Canada by backing or opposing certain candidates in the elections. </p><p>While the elections’ overall outcome was not affected, the interference could have affected a handful of individual races, according to the inquiry commission.</p><p>China and India focused their activities in electoral districts in Toronto and Vancouver, where large and well-organized Chinese and Indian diasporas are populated by some of the voters highly sought after by Canada’s political parties. The public hearings showed that China and its proxies tried to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/world/americas/canada-china-election-interference.html" title="">undermine</a> candidates of the main opposition Conservative Party, which has adopted a tough line on China’s record on human rights and its control over Hong Kong.</p><p>By contrast, the Chinese government and its proxies tended to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/world/americas/canada-elections-china.html" title="">support</a> candidates of Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party, intelligence reports showed. After Mr. Trudeau was first elected in 2015, he pushed for friendly ties with Beijing, including through a free-trade agreement, and dismissed warnings about allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies to work in Canada.</p><p>Witnesses and intelligence reports showed how foreign governments and their proxies tried to influence elections by targeting diaspora members, many of whom have relatives in their countries of origin and also business and other ties. Though diaspora communities were shown to be the focal point of foreign interference, the commission made no strong recommendations about how to protect those voters, said <a href="https://ontariotechu.ca/experts/fssh/dennis-molinaro.php?utm_source=featured_expert&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=Dennis%20Molinaro" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dennis Molinaro</a>, a former national security analyst for the Canadian government who now teaches legal studies at Ontario Tech University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Foreign interference is happening in diaspora communities,” Mr. Molinaro said. “If it didn’t happen in diaspora communities, you wouldn’t have foreign interference anywhere else, and the report was relatively quiet about that.”</p><p>Accused of benefiting from Chinese interference, Mr. Trudeau and his government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/world/canada/trudeau-election-interference-inquiry.html" title="">downplayed</a> its threat. But a series of leaks of intelligence reports to The Globe and Mail newspaper and the Global News television network, forced Mr. Trudeau to order the inquiry.</p><p>Canada also accused the Indian government of orchestrating the 2023 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/23/world/canada/canada-india-sikhs.html" title="">killing near Vancouver</a> of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian leader of the Sikh independence movement in India.</p><p>The inquiry showed how foreign powers had exploited weaknesses in Canada’s democratic system, especially in its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/world/americas/canada-democracy-foreign-interference.html" title="">political parties’ opaque operations</a>. Political parties select candidates for general elections in nomination races with loose rules and no outside oversight.</p><p>While party bosses used the system to flex their muscles, the nominations were what the inquiry commission described as “gateways for foreign states who wish to interfere in our democratic processes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>In one Liberal Party nomination race in a Toronto district with a large Chinese diaspora, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/world/canada/canada-election-china-han-dong.html" title="">buses</a> transported dozens of foreign students from China to back a candidate, Han Dong, who was favored by Beijing. </p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Han Dong, a Liberal Party candidate favored by the Chinese government, easily won election to the House of Commons from Markham, Ontario, part of the greater Toronto area. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ian Willms for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>According to a special parliamentary committee report, the Chinese consulate told the students that they had to vote for Mr. Dong to keep their student visas. Mr. Dong won the nomination in the district, a Liberal stronghold, and then cruised to victory in the general election.</p><p>As details of foreign interference emerged in the public hearings, Parliament last summer passed legislation that created a registry of foreign agents and that made it easier to investigate and prosecute foreign meddling.</p><p>In the final report, Justice Hogue wrote that “isolated cases where foreign interference may have had some impact on the outcome of a nomination contest or the result of an election in a given” electoral district. But she added that she was “reassured by the minimal impact such efforts have had to date.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Duff Conacher, a founder of <a href="https://democracywatch.ca/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Democracy Watch</a>, an independent watchdog organization, said the final report underestimates foreign interference, about which much remains unknown.</p><p>“Just disinformation alone is having much more than a minimal impact,” Mr. Conacher said. “Add to that the documented cases, which are not minimal. And there’s the killing of a Canadian citizen, and the threat that the members of the diaspora of many countries feel. That’s not minimal.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>10</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Report Finds Trudeau’s Government Left Elections Vulnerable to Interference<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Young Haitians’ Lives Disrupted: </strong>Robbed of their education and their prospects for the future, legions of Haitian children are the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/world/americas/haiti-children-schools.html">overlooked victims of the gang violence that has crippled the country</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cracking a Vast Art Fraud: </strong>In a remote Canadian city, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/world/canada/norval-morrisseau-art-fraud.html">a hardened detective and an angry rock star</a> brought down two criminal rings that had produced thousands of fake paintings sold as works by a celebrated Indigenous artist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drawing a Window Into the Middle East: </strong>The French cartoonist Riad Sattouf’s saga of his parents’ failed bicultural marriage, with its harsh depiction of life in rural Syria, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/world/europe/riad-sattouf-cartoons-france-syria.html">has become a literary sensation</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inside the Gaza Truce Negotiations: </strong>The Qatari prime minister, working with both the Biden administration’s envoy and a representative for Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/middleeast/gaza-truce-negotiations.html">formed an unlikely partnership to seal the cease-fire deal</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jair Bolsonaro’s Stay-Out-of-Jail Card: </strong>The former Brazilian president, squeezed by criminal investigations, is looking to President Trump, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to shift his nation’s politics — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-trump-us.html">and maybe keep him a free man</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
