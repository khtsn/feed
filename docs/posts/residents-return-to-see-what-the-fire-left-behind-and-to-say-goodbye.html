What if, she feared, she couldn’t get back into her home before the rains came and washed her daughter’s ashes into an indistinguishable heap of debris and dust?</p><p>On Tuesday, Ms. Miller returned to her house for the first time since the Eaton fire consumed it two weeks ago. She rushed out of her car and immediately looked through the gaping hole where her stained-glass front door had once stood. She peered across a yawning pile of gray debris and saw it: the white urn, still sitting on the back patio atop a metal table that had also had survived.</p><p>A bonsai tree that had sat atop the urn was gone, and the ceramic vessel cracked when Ms. Miller picked it up. But the ashes of her daughter, Allison, who died four years ago at age 20 of congenital heart failure, were still there. Ms. Miller placed the urn in a cardboard box and prepared to load it into her car.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Now it’s over,” she said, turning away from the rubble of her house. “Take it away.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/us/23nat-lafire-return-04/23nat-lafire-return-04-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/us/23nat-lafire-return-04/23nat-lafire-return-04-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/us/23nat-lafire-return-04/23nat-lafire-return-04-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Three people wearing white suits, respirators and eye protection look through belongings." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/us/23nat-lafire-return-04/23nat-lafire-return-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/us/23nat-lafire-return-04/23nat-lafire-return-04-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/us/23nat-lafire-return-04/23nat-lafire-return-04-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/23/us/23nat-lafire-return-04/23nat-lafire-return-04-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7d3b9672-dac2-5fd6-9436-568c0439130b" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Altadena residents returned to their neighborhood for the first time this week to sift through the ruins of their lives. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deborah Cap lived in a home on East Palm Street in Altadena.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Altadena residents returned to their neighborhood for the first time this week to sift through the ruins of their lives. Most of them already knew the state of their homes before they arrived, based on damage assessments, aerial views and word of mouth. They came to see firsthand the extent of their losses, and to determine if they could salvage anything from their share of the sea of debris.</p><p>Some donned respirators, white Tyvek suits, gloves and goggles to shield themselves from toxic chemicals and the hazardous dust that puffed into the air each time they poked a shovel, stick or finger into what remained. Miraculous recoveries of wedding rings or family heirlooms were rare. Ceramic pieces and cast iron skillets were among the more common household items to survive.</p><p>“Everything’s special, you know,” said Shelan Joseph, 54, standing in front of her fireplace in a protective suit and picking through the tangle of melted glass and ash that remained of Christmas decorations that she hadn’t gotten around to taking down. “I was just trying to come and see what we could save of our lives. And I guess maybe just a little bit of closure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Some found dark humor in the wreckage. Ms. Joseph’s husband, Vernon Patterson, 63, gestured toward a chair next to their backyard pool.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marie Buccolo sifts through the rubble of her home in Altadena. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>People donned respirators, white Tyvek suits, gloves and goggles to shield themselves from toxic chemicals.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We’ve been trying to get rid of that chair forever,” he said. “And it’s no scratches, no nothing.”</p><p>Some approached the rubble with a sense of detachment and practicality. For others, the trip home was a shock.</p><p>Lou Avery Douglas, 26, returned to Altadena and parked in his regular spot in front of what was left of his apartment complex, the Mariposa Townhomes. It looked as though the fire had melted the building and everything in it, turning it all the same pale ash color. He identified his unit only thanks to a bright red patio table that had withstood the flames.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He started to sob.</p><p>Mr. Douglas and his roommate, Grace Colcord, picked through the ashes in a daze. Then she called out that she had found one of his mugs, decorated with a rainbow and the phrase “May your day be filled with happiness.”</p><p>“I was just overjoyed in that moment,” Mr. Douglas said. “One of my things survived. Even if everything else is gone, I have one thing.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Grace Colcord found a ring that was given to her by her mother. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Some approached the rubble with a sense of detachment and practicality.

Mr. Douglas recognized the contours of his cookbooks, which were still stacked where he had left them. But they had all burned into the same shade of very light gray, “and the second you touch them, they turn to ash and they fly away — almost like a ghost,” he said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Mat and Kate Stovall were both out of town when the fire destroyed their home of nearly a decade. They grieved from afar, then returned on Tuesday in Tyvek suits and respirators because they needed to see the loss for themselves.</p><p>They were thrilled that the fire had damaged but not killed a seven-foot cactus next to the house. Ms. Stovall had saved it from insect infestations a few times, which required “a lot of scrubbing with a brush and some dish soap.” On this day, she and her husband cut off several wrinkly limbs that were still green and plump, which they hoped to use to propagate the cactus.</p><p>The fire’s strange work was on display at the ruined home of Debra Tuttle, 52, where puddles of melted aluminum and brass sat on the ground and water pipes were bent near charred kitchen appliances.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mat and Kate Stovall were thrilled that the fire had damaged but not killed a seven-foot cactus next to the house. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>David and Lois Williams had lived in their home on East Palm Street in Altadena since 1975. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>A county official had taped a red piece of paper over what remained of her house’s facade, declaring it “UNSAFE.” </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In the days after the fire, Ms. Tuttle’s mother, a ceramics artist who lived in the home with her, had mused about whether this or that treasured object might have survived. Ms. Tuttle recovered a porcelain bell and a beautifully glazed mug, both from Japan; a purple vase with a bit of glass melted onto it; and some of her mother’s wedding silverware, now blackened and charred.</p><p>Before driving away, she looked out over the “unrecognizable mass” of wreckage and pointed out a microwave, a small grill for fish and a muffin pan.</p><p>“All these little things, they’re kind of like finding old friends,” Ms. Tuttle said. “But on the other hand, they say to you, My time is done.”</p><p>Soumya Karlamangla<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Isabelle Taft is a reporter covering national news and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their career.<span> </span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/01/23/us/la-fires-residents-return-home.html">1</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/01/23/us/la-fires-residents-return-home.html">1</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the Los Angeles Wildfires</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Unbearable Damage</strong>: Some evacuees from the Eaton fire have been allowed back into their homes, only to find that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/los-angeles-fires-smoke-ash-damage.html">smoke and ash have made living there impossible for now</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Who Is in Charge?</strong>: The fires have exposed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/us/wildfires-los-angeles-governance.html">web of overlapping governments in the greater Los Angeles area</a>, a muddled authority by design.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Fireproof Dream Home</strong>: They designed their Malibu house to withstand even the worst of California’s natural disasters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/us/malibu-home-california-wildfires.html">But after the mental toll of the fires, will they stay?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>How Will L.A.
