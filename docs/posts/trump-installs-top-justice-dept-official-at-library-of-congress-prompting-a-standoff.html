The people who described it did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Around 9 a.m., the two Justice Department officials arrived at the library’s James Madison Memorial Building and sought access to the U.S. Copyright Office, which is housed there. They brought a letter from the White House declaring that Mr. Blanche was the acting librarian and that he had selected the two men for top roles at the agency.</p><p>They were Paul Perkins, an associate deputy attorney general who the letter said would serve as the acting register of copyrights and the director of the Copyright Office, and Brian Nieves, a deputy chief of staff and senior policy counsel who had been designated as the acting deputy librarian. Mr. Trump also fired the previous director of the Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter, over the weekend, one of the people said.</p><p>Staff members at the library balked and called the U.S. Capitol Police as well as their general counsel, Meg Williams, who told the two officials that they were not allowed access to the Copyright Office and asked them to leave, one of the people said.</p><p>Mr. Perkins and Mr. Nieves then left the building willingly, accompanied to the door by Ms. Williams. The library’s staff is recognizing Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian who was Dr. Hayden’s No. 2, as the acting librarian until it gets direction from Congress, one of the people familiar with the situation said.</p><p>In a brief email to the staff on Monday, Mr. Newlen noted that the White House had named a new acting librarian and suggested that the matter was still unresolved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Currently, Congress is engaged with the White House, and we have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward. We will share additional information as we receive it,” he wrote, signing the note as the “acting librarian of Congress.”</p><p>The librarian of Congress is a presidentially appointed post, subject to confirmation by the Senate.</p><p>Representative Joseph D. Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee and a member of the Joint Committee on the Library, said the move amounted to a “power-hungry assault on the legislative branch.” </p><p>He and a fellow joint committee member, Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California and the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, criticized Republicans for not speaking out against it.<span>  </span></p><p>“It is extremely concerning that Trump sent executive branch officials from the Department of Justice to take over a legislative branch agency,”<span>  </span>the two lawmakers said in a joint statement Monday. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Congress must stand up for Article I of the Constitution and defend the nonpartisan Library and the legislative branch from White House political control,” they added, referring to the article that describes the powers of Congress.</p><p>Mr. Morelle led five other House Democrats in <a href="https://democrats-cha.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-cha.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/5.12.25-letter-to-loc-ig-re-investigation.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling for an investigation</a> into whether the library had given the Department of Government Efficiency or other executive branch agencies unauthorized access to congressional or library data.</p><p>After Mr. Trump terminated Dr. Hayden, who had served in the job since 2016, the White House accused her of having placed “inappropriate books in the library for children.”</p><p>The Library of Congress houses the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan information to assist in the drafting of legislation, and the Copyright Office. It also functions as the nation’s library, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/about/general-information/#year-at-a-glance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holding more than 25 million cataloged books</a>. It is primarily a research facility limited to people 16 years or older, but it also has a children’s reading room.</p><p>Tim Balk<!-- --> and <!-- -->Jennifer Schuessler<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maya C.
