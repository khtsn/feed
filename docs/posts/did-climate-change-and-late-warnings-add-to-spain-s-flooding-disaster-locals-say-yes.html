Still others pointed their fingers at their politicians, who sounded the alarm only after the flood was already raging, compounding the catastrophe.</p><p>“It was a mix of two things,” said Francesc Zamorano, 22, who left his house to go to work on Tuesday evening in the town of Sedaví, in Valencia Province, and found himself in the middle of the flood. “Obviously, it’s a catastrophe caused by climate change,” he added. “But if the government warned us earlier, everything would be different.”</p><p>The rains that hit the towns of east-central Spain, prompting rivers to escape their banks and killing more than 200 people, were an exceptional event. In Chiva, nearly 20 inches of rain fell in eight hours on Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/aemet_esp/status/1851585885273301186?s=61" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spain’s meteorological agency</a> said.

Tapiador, a professor of earth physics at University of Castilla-La Mancha.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In Chiva, Juan Jose Sánchez Conoves, 74, a farmer and a beekeeper, said that because of the droughts, his vines were shorter and less fruitful than usual this year, producing only two kilograms of grapes per vine (about 4.4 pounds) instead of six or seven, he said.</p><p>“We went from years of drought to savage rain,” he said. “I don’t understand.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The cracked ground at the Sau reservoir in Vilanova de Sau, Catalonia, in January.

His home in Chiva, covered in blue and white Azulejo ceramic tiles, now was blanketed in mud, with a huge crater in one of its rooms where the floor had collapsed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>If they had told people in time, “nobody would have died in their cars,” he said. “If the factories were closed, nobody would die in the factories.”</p><p>Josefa García Pastor, a spokeswoman for the regional government of Valencia, said that the public information available at the time did not indicate that the weather was going to be so devastating, and that in the previous days, the authorities had put out some messages on social media warning the population to be cautious because of a risk of flooding.</p><p>She said the conditions for sending out the mass alert (which include the magnitude of the threat and the possible consequences for public security) had not been met before it was transmitted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents and volunteers cleaning up an area affected by floods in Paiporta on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alberto Saiz/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Many Spaniards were not satisfied with that explanation.</p><p>“This was negligence,” said Isabel Vicente, adding that rivers of mud were already tearing through her street when she got the alert. “When they told us, we could not do anything anymore.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>When the conservative Popular Party came to power last year in Valencia, supported by the far-right Vox party, the new government disbanded an emergency unit that had been created by the previous socialist administration to accelerate the response to serious crises.
