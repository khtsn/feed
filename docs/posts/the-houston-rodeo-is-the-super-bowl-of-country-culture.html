Inevitably, the contestants slide off the sheep and face-plant into the dirt, with some coming away crying, others grinning proudly. Either outcome, the crowd at the largest livestock exhibition and rodeo in the world goes wild.</p><p>The Houston rodeo, which runs March 4 to 23, is beyond Texas-size. More than 2.5 million people attended last year.

Millions of dollars change hands as heifers brought in from around the world are sold, and programs highlighting <a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/calendar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific livestock breeds</a>, like the Open Beefmaster Show, draw spectators and participants alike.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>There’s also an <a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/rodeo-uncorked-wine/champion-wine-garden/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">international wine competition</a>, <a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/worlds-championship-bar-b-que/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a championship</a> contest for barbecue, and a state-fair-size <a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/plan-your-visit/attractions-and-activities/#drone-show" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">carnival</a> with roller coasters and Ferris wheels.

She then headed off to buy a Texas praline caramel apple.</p><p>The evenings are capped off by fireworks, drone shows and concerts in a 72,200-seat stadium; this year’s performers include Reba McEntire, Journey and Post Malone.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-10"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jordan Jo Hollabaugh competed in the breakaway roping competition.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jackson Ward was a contestant in the bull-riding competition.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The cheapest way in is to buy a combination <a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/tickets/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ticket</a> to the grounds, the carnival and the livestock shows ($21 per adult), but most people also want to see the showcase stadium event: a two-hour professional rodeo of roping and riding, followed by the big concert.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Jordan Spears in the bull-riding competition. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The rodeo riders atop the raging, bucking broncos could go home with life-changing injuries, incurred in front of tens of thousands of people.

About halfway through the events, the lights dimmed and a beautiful white horse trotted calmly from a cloud of smoke on one end of the arena, followed by her foal, who played under the spotlight; the moment acted as a grace note, lightening the brutal stakes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A sight of calm in a night of action-packed events.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The rodeo has an unfettered, unapologetic view of meat consumption — when it began in 1932, it was called the Houston Fat Stock Show.

The birthing center is a big draw, where children can watch mother pigs nudge their newborns’ first steps; you can also watch chicks hatch, try your hand at milking a cow or learn how to plant crops.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than 2.5 million people attended the Houston rodeo last year. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>Perhaps the most rewarding experience is an unadvertised one: the chance to speak with families who ranch and farm, and who come to the rodeo so their children can show off the rabbit, guinea pig or calf that they have been nurturing all year. Many suburban families travel to soccer tournaments, but these families travel to livestock shows.</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-22"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A treat especially for children: watching chicks hatch from their eggs.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A piglet gets dried off after swimming in a stock tank exhibition.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A crowd favorite at the rodeo is the pig races, where numbered piglets dash around a pen, chasing a treat. </span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The children who bring their animals stand to win thousands of dollars: In 2025, the rodeo will give away over $14 million in scholarships.</p><p>“Our thousands of volunteers enable us to maximize our charitable impact,” said the rodeo’s board chairman, Pat Mann Phillips.
