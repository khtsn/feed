    <h1>Appeals Court Disqualifies Fani Willis From Prosecuting Georgia Trump Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Georgiaâ€™s Court of Appeals on Thursday disqualified the Atlanta prosecutor who brought an election interference case against President-elect Donald J. Trump and his allies, a surprise move that threw the entire case into disarray.</p><p>In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel reversed the trial judge, who in March had allowed Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., to keep the case, despite revelations about a romantic relationship she had with the lawyer who was hired to manage the prosecution.</p><p>All three of the appeals judges are Republican appointees. While the decision is likely to be appealed to the full court, if it stands, it could doom the entire case, which is the last active criminal prosecution involving charges against Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Trump and 14 of his allies are charged with conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Biden in Georgia.</p></div></div>
