Trump and his allies, a surprise move that threw the entire case into disarray.</p><p>In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel reversed the trial judge, who in March had allowed Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., to keep the case, despite revelations about a romantic relationship she had with the lawyer who was hired to manage the prosecution.</p><p>All three of the appeals judges are Republican appointees. While the decision is likely to be appealed to the full court, if it stands, it could doom the entire case, which is the last active criminal prosecution involving charges against Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Trump and 14 of his allies are charged with conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Biden in Georgia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Judge Scott McAfee, the trial court judge, had rejected a defense claim that Ms. Willis’s relationship with the lawyer she hired had given her a financial stake in the case. But he found that the relationship had raised “a significant appearance of impropriety” that needed to be addressed, and he effectively forced Ms. Willis to dismiss the lawyer, Nathan J. Wade.</p><p>The appeals panel said that Judge McAfee’s decision “did not cure the already existing appearance of impropriety.”</p><p>Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, reacted to the ruling in a statement: “In granting President Trump an overwhelming mandate, the American people have demanded an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all the witch hunts against him.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.
