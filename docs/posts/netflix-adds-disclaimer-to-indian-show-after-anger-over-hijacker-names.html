In the show, the hijackers refer to themselves by code names, including “Shankar,” a common name for Hindu men.</p><p>That prompted anger among many social media users, with some accusing the producers of playing down the Muslim identity of the hijackers. A national official of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Amit Malviya, said the series’ use of the hijackers’ aliases “legitimized their criminal intent.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Decades later, people will think Hindus hijacked IC-814,” Mr. Malviya, who oversees information technology and social media for the B.J.P., <a href="https://x.com/amitmalviya/status/1830264409777717604" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X on Monday.</p><p>India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting summoned a Netflix executive to discuss the government’s grievances about the show, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/netflix-series-row-opening-disclaimer-to-carry-real-names-of-ic-814-hijackers-9548944/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to local media reports</a>.</p><p>“For the benefit of audiences unfamiliar with the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814, the opening disclaimer in India has been updated to include the real and code names of the hijackers,” Netflix said in a statement on Tuesday.</p><p>During the actual hijacking of the flight, over eight days, the militants forced the pilots to fly the plane to a number of locations, including Dubai, and then Kandahar, Afghanistan, which was ruled by the Taliban at the time. The plane’s passengers were freed after India released three Pakistanis who had been held under terrorism charges.</p><p>The Indian government said at the time that the five hijackers were from Pakistan and <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/5481/Union+Home+Ministers+StatementIndian+Airlines+Flight+IC814" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used code names, including “Shankar,”</a> in front of the passengers and crew to conceal their identities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Before the show’s release on Aug. 29, its director, Anubhav Sinha, <a href="https://scroll.in/reel/1072459/ic-814-the-kandahar-hijack-director-anubhav-sinha-an-accessible-thriller-with-layering" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Scroll</a>, an Indian news site, that his goal was to present the event “exactly in the manner in which it happened.”</p><p>The updated disclaimer on Netflix now says the series “does not make any claims of authenticity or historical correctness” of the events featured in it.
