I knew I’d reached her driveway when I saw a Harris-Walz sign and another that read, “Lock him up,” next to a security camera that she installed to stop her neighbors from tearing them down. So many Trump signs dotted that old country road that you’d think my aunt was the only Democrat in town.</p><p>But she invited nine of her friends over to talk politics with me, including three Republicans who planned to vote for Kamala Harris. They felt just as passionately as my aunt did, but many said they didn’t want to put up signs. One said she and her husband had moved there recently and didn’t want to rock the boat with their neighbors. Another expressed fear of “weird militias.”</p><p>“People are very nervous what’s going to happen,”<strong> </strong>Becky Loftus, a Puerto Rican woman who married a coal miner’s son from the area, told the group. If Harris wins, there will be violence, she said, and if Trump wins, there will be violence. “It’s a no-win situation.”</p><p>They were not unlike Democrats in other places. They hated Trump — his lies, his policies, his character, his hair. They had all gone through the same emotions as every other Democrat I knew: depression after Trump’s debate with President Biden, skepticism that Harris could lead and then absolute elation when she made it a race again after Biden dropped out. Now they were experiencing a new emotion: political dread of Election Day, when, after all that we as a nation have been through, it will still not be over.</p><p>But it felt good anyway, they said, to gather in the same room and be reminded that they weren’t alone. Records show that there are almost the same number of registered Democrats (87,314) as Republicans in the county (87,724) and there are 22,456 unaffiliated with either party.</p><p>There is no doubt that Trump has deep support here. But perhaps not as deep as one would think from counting signs along these old country roads. Let’s remember that yard signs don’t vote. People do.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="28" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2Q3YzNkYzQ0LTM0NGEtNWZjOS1hMjRlLWI1ZTQyZTkwYTVjYw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#texas-execution-innocence" data-source-id="100000009770128"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-18T19:53:12.767Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 18, 2024, 3:53 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>The Texas justice system really wants to kill Robert Roberson.</p><p>It’s hard to come to any other conclusion after watching the life-or-death pinball game judges and prosecutors there have been playing with Roberson, who was sentenced to die in connection with the death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki, in 2002. In the two decades since, overwhelming evidence of Roberson’s innocence has come to light, and yet those with the power to stop his execution have refused to act or have pushed affirmatively ahead with plans to end his life.</p><p>On Thursday night, the pinball took a small bounce in Roberson’s favor, when the Texas Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/texas-execution-robert-roberson.html" title="">halted his execution</a> at the last minute. The pause was temporary and procedural; his death sentence could still be carried out soon.</p><p>It would be the nation’s first execution in a case involving shaken-baby syndrome, according to Roberson’s lawyers. That was how Nikki died, according to doctors at the time, but the diagnosis — both as to her and generally — has been thrown into doubt as evidence of its scientific unreliability has mounted.</p><p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state’s highest criminal court, acknowledged that unreliability just last week, when it ordered a new trial in another shaken-baby case. The court cited Texas’ “junk science” law, which allows prisoners to challenge their convictions in light of changed scientific understandings. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/texas-execution-robert-roberson-shaken-baby.html" title="">the court has refused</a> to invoke that law in Roberson’s case, perhaps because his prosecutors continue to stand by their expert testimony from the trial.</p><p>The court has also refused to consider other evidence in Roberson’s favor, including straightforward medical explanations for Nikki’s death and his own diagnosis of autism, which would explain his apparent lack of emotion on the night Nikki died.</p><p>The case for Roberson’s innocence has become powerful enough to compel a bipartisan group of 86 Texas lawmakers to plead for a grant of clemency from Gov. Greg Abbott. Earlier Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25232846/roberson-order.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made the same plea</a> in response to the court’s denial of Roberson’s request for a stay of execution. Citing what she said was the “mounting evidence” that Nikki died of pneumonia and improperly prescribed medication, she lamented that the federal courts did not have jurisdiction in the case, but urged the governor to grant a reprieve of 30 days to give the pardon board a chance to review the evidence of innocence.</p><p>“Few cases more urgently call for such a remedy than one where the accused has made a serious showing of actual innocence, as Roberson has here,” Sotomayor wrote.</p><p>Abbott has yet to act, and he may not be able to at this point, under <a href="https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/bpp/exec_clem/exec_clem.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Texas law</a> that bars clemency if the state pardons board has recommended against it.</p><p>Perhaps the most compelling advocate in Roberson’s corner is Brian Wharton, the chief detective who investigated Nikki’s case, but who has since come to have what he calls “unassailable doubt” about Roberson’s guilt. He is horrified that the state is moving forward to execute him anyway.</p><p>“We claim to be a pro-life state and yet we stack ’em up in the death house faster than anybody else,” Wharton told The Times in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/opinion/death-penalty-texas.html" title="">video for Times Opinion</a>.</p><p>“Humans are too fallible to do this fairly,” he said. “We make mistakes.”</p><p>Mistakes can be fixed; executions cannot. That’s why the only sure way to avoid the chaos and miscarriage of justice in cases like Roberson’s is to ban state-sanctioned killing for good.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="25" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QxZDE0OTFhLWFiNDgtNTgxNi1iYjE3LWVmYjBkYzcyMDNlYQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#trump-enemies-pelosis" data-source-id="100000009769483"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-alter"><img alt="Jonathan Alter" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-18T14:33:20.120Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 18, 2024, 10:33 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>How can you support a candidate who says he wants to use the National Guard against a former speaker of the House and her husband?</p><p>That’s a question every Republican who favors Donald Trump must be asked over and over again between now and the election.</p><p>On Wednesday, during a Fox News town hall, he expanded on his threat to use the National Guard and possibly the military to go after “the enemy within.” For the first time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-democrats-enemies-within-rcna175628" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump identified two of those “enemies within”</a> who are “so sick and so evil”: Nancy and Paul Pelosi.</p><p>Trump supporters blithely say he would never go through with this. But after politicizing the Department of Justice, which he would surely do, he would almost certainly go after the Pelosis and encourage his MAGA followers to do the same, with the threat of violence against them increasingly explicit. Why not? The Supreme Court ruled that presidents are immune from prosecution when performing their “official duties.”</p><p>Trump has hated Nancy Pelosi since at least early 2020, when she ripped up a copy of his State of the Union address after he spoke. On Jan. 6, 2021, he was unmoved by reports that the insurrectionists wanted to kill the speaker and vice president.</p><p>In his June 27 debate with President Biden, Trump said Pelosi had failed to do her job of calling out the National Guard to stop the Jan. 6 rioting and that outtakes from her daughter’s documentary would prove it. These preposterous claims went largely unnoticed amid criticism of Biden’s poor performance.</p><p>Trump also blames Pelosi for maneuvering Biden out of the race and wrecking Trump’s chances for a landslide win.</p><p>His true depravity came through in his treatment of the 82-year-old Paul Pelosi, who suffered a fractured skull in 2022 when a Trump cultist broke into the family’s San Francisco home and attacked him with a hammer. While Pelosi was still hospitalized, Trump spread right-wing conspiracy theories.</p><p>“Weird things going on in that household in the last couple of weeks,” he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/trump-paul-pelosi-attack-conspiracy-theory-00064417" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a radio show</a>. “The glass, it seems, was broken from the inside to the out, so it wasn’t a break-in; it was a break-out.” He retweeted even more outlandish and slanderous slurs.</p><p>Trump was still at it in 2023. “We’ll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco. How’s her husband doing — anybody know?” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/29/trump-mocks-pelosi-family-as-he-rallies-conservative-support-in-california-00119243" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump told the California Republican Party convention</a>, a line that drew guffaws from the heartless audience. “And she’s against building a wall at our border, even though she has a wall around her house, which obviously didn’t do a very good job.”</p><p>Nancy Pelosi said that she has no wall outside her home and that Trump’s comments were “sick.” Biden went further in private, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2024/02/01/what-biden-really-says-about-trump-behind-closed-doors-00139178" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">adding an expletive to “sick.”</a></p><p>Now that Trump has attached names to his line about “enemies within,” the question is how Republicans will react. Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia tried to claim on CNN that Trump was talking about migrants, not Americans. That won’t wash anymore.</p><p>Whatever one thinks of their politics, the Pelosis are American. Trump is unmistakably un-American. The difference should become a major focus of this campaign.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="24" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2YzMzBhOWY0LWM4NzktNThkMi1hMWE3LWU3ZDVjNDdlZDA0Yw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#eric-trump-job-behavior" data-source-id="100000009768006"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-18T09:04:58.312Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 18, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Matt Slocum/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Every Friday through the election, Michelle Cottle will highlight outstanding examples of misdeeds, outrageous statements and simply bizarre political behavior.</em></p><p>A couple of clarifying moments from Donald Trump’s clan this week, showing what they really think of working-class Americans:</p><p>First, Trump père dissed a whole category of U.S. autoworkers during his sit-down with Bloomberg News at the <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHQ/status/1846244477100302681" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Economic Club of Chicago</a>: “They don’t build cars,” he said. “They take ’em out of a box, and they assemble them. We could have our child do it.”</p><p>Then there was Eric Trump, <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1846696156669399403" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sneering</a> at Kamala Harris’s résumé on Fox News: “She’s never actually had a real job, right? She has been in the federal government her entire adult life. She has never signed the front of a check.”</p><p>So, a few things about that:</p><p>First, a vast majority of Americans do not have jobs requiring them to sign the front of a check — teachers, autoworkers, beat cops, firefighters, flight attendants, restaurant servers, coal miners …</p><p>Second, a nepo baby who has worked for his daddy his entire adult life might want to think twice about making snide proclamations about what constitutes a “real” job.</p><p>That said, I can see how Eric Trump might have strong feelings about a tough-as-nails prosecutor, which is how Harris started out, considering his father’s extensive experience with the criminal justice system.</p><hr/><p>Late last week, the Democratic mayor of East Cleveland, Ohio, Brandon King, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/east-cleveland-mayor-brandon-king-indicted-on-charges-of-theft-in-office/ar-AA1s2UWK?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was indicted</a> on a mishmash of felony and misdemeanor charges, including theft in office, having an unlawful interest in a public contract and soliciting improper compensation.</p><p>Potentially criminal behavior by an elected official — no big deal in the Trump era, right? Except that King is the third of the city’s past four mayors to face charges.</p><p>That’s quite a municipal record to boast about.</p><hr/><p>The Republican nominee to represent Michigan’s Seventh Congressional District, Tom Barrett, <a href="https://twitter.com/LongTimeHistory/status/1846314280884605102" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ran a full-page ad in The Michigan Bulletin, a Black-owned newspaper</a> focused on serving the Black community around Lansing, urging people to turn out and vote for him on Nov. 6.</p><p>Read that sentence again.</p><p>Nov. … 6?</p><p>Barrett’s campaign has insisted this was simply a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/tom-barrett-campaign-says-proofing-error-to-blame-for-incorrect-election-day-date-on-ad/ar-AA1sfWje?ocid=BingNewsVerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proofreading error</a> and said it will run a corrected ad in a future edition. The Michigan Legislative Black Caucus is unimpressed and has asked the state attorney general to look into whether any election laws were violated. The A.G.’s office has already <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/15/nessel-sends-barrett-campaign-cease-and-desist-notice-over-error-in-ad/75693007007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> Barrett’s campaign a cease and desist notice.</p><hr/><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson might have ascended to one of the highest offices in the land, but he remains a shameless “stop the steal” Trumpian bootlicker. “I think there is going to be some cheating in this election. I think noncitizens are going to vote,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/13/mike-johnson-jan6-election-real-00183557" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a> on CBS’s “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-johnson-house-speaker-face-the-nation-transcript-10-13-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Face the Nation” last Sunday</a>.</p><p>Estimating that there are “16 million illegal aliens in the country” since the Biden administration “opened the border wide,” Johnson speculated, “Because of that, there’s concern. Because those people are distributed all around the country, as you know, there’s concern some of those people will try to participate in the elections.”</p><p>The intricacies of border policy notwithstanding, I feel confident that an even bigger reason “there’s concern” about the possibility of noncitizens voting and of widespread voting fraud more generally — which, to be clear, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/re-examining-how-and-why-voter-fraud-is-exceedingly-rare-in-the-us-ahead-of-th-idUSL1N2XP2AI/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is not a thing in the United States</a> — is that Republican leaders like Johnson have spent the past four years parroting Trump’s lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen.</p><p>But don’t let the truth stand in your way, Mr. Speaker. You just keep on undermining public faith in America’s electoral system. What could possibly go wrong?</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="22" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2E4YTY0NGE1LWJmMGQtNWQ1MC1iNmE0LTE3YmI3OGY5OWNjOA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#trump-latino-haitian-language" data-source-id="100000009767740"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-17T20:31:11.679Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 17, 2024, 4:31 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chandan Khanna/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The town hall Donald Trump held on Wednesday with undecided Latino voters, broadcast on Univision, is worth watching. The subjects discussed were substantive and pertinent (the links will take you to the questions): the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=162" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost of living</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=789" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the national debt</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=594" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">youth underemployment</a>, the reality of Trump’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=337" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass deportation</a> plan, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=2401" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">school shootings</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=1249" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immigration reform and the bipartisan border bill</a>. Trump’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=1999" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full answer</a> to a former Republican from Tampa who is still deeply bothered by Jan. 6 is highly worth watching, especially for the voter’s visibly skeptical reaction to the answer. </p><p>But a question about Springfield, Ohio, is also worth looking at, for a depressing reason. A Republican <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F3tvZi5fTZw?feature=shared&amp;t=1485" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked Trump</a>: “The authorities in Springfield, Ohio, have more than one time clarified that the Haitians are not eating their cats and their dogs. Nonetheless, you want to revoke the permit they have to legally reside in this country. My question to you, very respectfully, is: Do you really believe that these people are eating the people’s pets?”</p><p>Trump started his answer by saying that he was “just saying what’s been reported,” which as the voter mentioned, is not what authorities say. But Trump continued:</p><blockquote><p>I will say this as far as Springfield is concerned because I do know that situation, you have a city of 52,000 people and they’ve added almost 30,000 migrants into the city. If you were a person that lived there, if you lived in Springfield, Ohio, and all of sudden you couldn’t get into a hospital, you couldn’t get your children into a school, you wouldn’t be able to buy groceries, you could no longer pay rent because the government’s paying rent, any of that — if any of that happened it would be a disaster for you and you wouldn’t be happy. We want to make our people safe and secure and we want to make ‘em happy, but Springfield, Ohio, is a perfect example — you have a town, a beautiful little town with no problems, all of a sudden, they have 30 or 32,000 people dropped into the town. Most of whom don’t speak the language, most of whom don’t speak the language at all, and what they’re doing is they’re looking all over for interpreters, well, I mean, I think you can’t just destroy our country. It’s — maybe some people disagree with me. But you can’t put in a very short period of time, 32,000 people in a 50,000-people town and expect things to go well. It’s a disaster.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a little more but that’s the general gist. People have focused on the pets aspect of this answer (or some of the factual issues with this answer, like the estimate generally being 15,000, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/09/30/dewine-ohio-gop-governor-confronts-trump-lies-00181595" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Martin’s recent piece</a> about the realities of Springfield is worth reading). But the gnarlier part is Trump’s emphasis on the fact that the Haitian workers don’t speak English as a big problem in and of itself.</p><p>One thing that might not be clear if you read a story about this exchange or the town hall is that a significant number of voters asked their questions in Spanish, which were then translated live — including this man’s question. It’s a commonplace, American thing to speak another language besides English. The idea of equating English alone with Americanness in this venue really highlighted just how wrong the whole idea is both conceptually and practically.</p><p>And on this subject, it’s worth reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/opinion/trump-immigration-rhetoric-poisoning.html" title="">Carlos Lozada’s column from the weekend</a> about the complexities of the immigrant and bilingual experience.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="21" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzkzYmNhMDlkLTVhZTgtNWVmNC1iZmNjLWIzY2NmZDRiOTYzZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#liam-payne-death-career" data-source-id="100000009767475"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/anna-marks"><img alt="Anna Marks" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/17/opinion/Anna-Marks/Anna-Marks-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/17/opinion/Anna-Marks/Anna-Marks-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/17/opinion/Anna-Marks/Anna-Marks-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-17T18:36:45.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 17, 2024, 2:36 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Luis Robayo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s no surprise that the internet would fiercely grieve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/arts/music/liam-payne-dead-one-direction.html" title="">the first death of a member of One Direction</a>, the band of teenagers that gave birth to online culture, although no one expected this day to come so soon. On Wednesday, the British singer and songwriter Liam Payne, 31, died after falling from a third-floor balcony in Buenos Aires; he will most likely be remembered by audiences for songs that stole the hearts of girls across the globe in the 2010s.</p><p>But the band he helped build will surely be remembered for the way its devoted audience became the architects of contemporary fandom. As news of Payne’s death spread online, long-dormant fan accounts sputtered back to life to marshal parasocial grief, earnest social media tributes and teary fan edits of the band’s best days.</p><p>But what these tributes do not capture is the way the public that propelled Payne to the heights of fame spent years doing precious little to avert his undoing.</p><p>Anyone who has been paying attention to Payne’s career after One Direction fell apart will have noticed that he was relentlessly mocked by pop culture watchers for false starts in his solo career, his comments about the band, his struggles with substance abuse, his body and the degree to which he supported his former bandmates.</p><p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13958869/amp/Maya-Henry-calls-lawyers-begins-legal-action-against-Liam-Payne-accusing-One-Direction-star-obsessive-contact-weaponising-fans-against-her.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Daily Mail reported</a> that Maya Henry, Payne’s ex-fiancée, accused Payne of obsessively contacting her. There was a cascade of networked harassment from fans and critics directed at <em>both parties </em>— at Payne for his alleged behavior and at Henry for daring to speak about it. After his death, this online harassment grew more acute.</p><p>Successive waves of anonymized internet outrage do not offer sufficient opportunities for change, rehabilitation or justice. Instead, they trap people in the worst-case versions of their past selves in the name of perceived proximity and clever dunking. More crucially, telling a story of someone’s life on the basis of online narratives can easily occlude systemic issues, like, for instance, the grueling conditions that make teenagers competing on a reality competition show into a hyper-commercial boy band that burned so bright it collapsed on itself.</p><p>The singer Rebecca Ferguson, who competed on the reality competition show “The X-Factor” with Payne, intimated in <a href="https://x.com/RebeccaFMusic/status/1846841039471984690?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media statement</a> that Payne was a victim of an industry’s “exploitation and profiteering of young stars” and claimed that he would be alive if he hadn’t auditioned. There’s no way to know whether she is right. But anyone who’s paying attention <em>does</em> know that time and again, former teen stars have spoken about how the entertainment industry prioritizes profit at the expense of their stability, safety and sense of self.</p><p>It’s not difficult to see shades of their stories in what the public knows about One Direction’s rise to fame. Consider what one of the band’s major-domos, Simon Cowell, said when he was asked last year what he <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/simon-cowell-regrets-not-owning-the-one-direction-name#:~:text=%22The%20one%20thing%20I%20regret,should%20have%20owned%20the%20name." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regretted</a> about One Direction. His answer? Not <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/zayn-malik-talks-pressure-one-direction-now-has-no-axiety-7728751/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zayn Malik’s anxiety</a> or <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/17/world-news/liam-paynes-history-with-alcohol-and-drug-abuse/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Payne’s alcoholism</a>, which each attributed to his time in the group, or the band’s exhausting schedule. (The band recorded five albums in five years while touring the globe.) Instead, Cowell said: “I should have owned the name. That’s the problem. When you give an artist the name, it’s not yours.”</p><p>An artist’s audience need not be as callous or controlling as the industry that brings him or her to our ears. And so it’s worth remembering that One Direction’s greatest legacy lies with the fan culture that made its members stars, for better and for worse.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="19" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg0Mzg2NjA5LTc5ZjItNWM4YS04ZDVjLTIyNmQ1ZDg3OWZhMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#states-felony-disenfranchisement-nebraska" data-source-id="100000009765346"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/brent-staples"><img alt="Brent Staples" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/opinion/brent-headshot/brent-headshot-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-17T09:24:12.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 17, 2024, 5:24 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Thalassa Raasch for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The Nebraska Supreme Court struck a blow for democracy on Wednesday when it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nebraska-supreme-court-rules-convicted-felons-completed-sentences-can-rcna175676" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled that people</a> with felony convictions could register to vote upon completion of their sentences instead of waiting two years, as the state had historically required.</p><p>The Nebraska Legislature had eliminated the waiting period in a bipartisan vote this year, but the secretary of state tried to block the new law, asserting that it was unconstitutional.

Since Jan. 1, 2020, 11 states — including California, Connecticut, Iowa and Minnesota, — have expanded voting rights for some non-incarcerated people with felony convictions. As states have enacted policies to curtail disenfranchisement, there has also been a decline in the number of people in prison, on probation and out on parole. As a consequence, the disenfranchised population has fallen from a little under six million in 2016 to about four million today.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Source: Sentencing Project</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>It is important to bear in mind that fewer than a third of those who are barred from the polls are incarcerated. Approximately 72 percent of those not allowed to vote are living in their communities — on probation, on parole or after completion of their sentences — carrying the shame of being denied a right that is fundamental to democracy.</p><p>The denial of this right casts a shadow over the poor communities where those who are locked out of the electoral system tend to live. Young people in these enclaves grow up with the unfortunate example of neighbors and family members who cannot vote and are permanently disengaged from the political process. The all-too-common lack of clarity about voting rules as they apply to former offenders leaves many Americans who are eligible to vote fearful of walking into the polls.</p><p>Mass disenfranchisement as practiced in the United States stands in sharp contrast with how other democracies handle this matter. Our peer nations would never think of stripping the vote from their citizens as casually as we do. In fact, many nations keep inmates connected to the societies to which most will inevitably return by setting up polling places <a href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/vote/usvot98o-04.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">behind prison walls</a>. International analyses invariably show that <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/out-of-step-u-s-policy-on-voting-rights-in-global-perspective/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the United States is an outlier</a> in permanently marginalizing people who are convicted of crimes.</p><p>One especially troubling thing about state laws that bar people convicted of crimes from voting is where those bans came from. They proliferated during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as states took extraordinary measures to prevent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/opinion/the-racist-origins-of-felon-disenfranchisement.html" title="">Black Americans from exercising the right to vote under the 15th Amendment</a>. This racially discriminatory system normalized disenfranchisement, allowing it to spread unchecked. The sooner the United States parts with this toxic legacy, the better off it will be.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="18" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QxZDg0NzM2LWY5NjMtNWY1NS1iY2EzLTY2ZDM0NmQ3OTg4NA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#kamala-harris-fox-news-interview" data-source-id="100000009766234"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-alter"><img alt="Jonathan Alter" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/12/opinion/jonathan-alter/jonathan-alter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-17T01:00:39.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 16, 2024, 9:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>What does anyone ever remember after an important interview? Certainly not the specifics of what was discussed. Most people — especially swing voters — don’t watch live. They see clips and get a general sense of how it went.</p><p>By that standard, Kamala Harris did just fine in her Fox News interview with Bret Baier on Wednesday. She didn’t close the deal, but she did show that she could go into the lion’s den and come out looking tough, which was the whole point of agreeing to go on Fox in the first place.</p><p>Harris should have been better prepared to answer certain predictable questions. When shown the clip of her expressing support for federally financed gender-affirming surgery for migrants in prison, she said she was just following the law, as Donald Trump did in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/us/politics/trump-prisons-transgender-care-harris.html" title="">allowing such surgery</a>. “Like throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house,” she said of his attacks.</p><p>Going on offense was necessary, but her response was insufficient. Baier backed into the question with the excuse that he was merely asking about a TV ad; he knew it had nothing to do with being president of the United States. Describing the issue as “really quite remote,” as Harris did, was too oblique of an answer to satisfy a skeptical audience.</p><p>But throughout most of the interview, Harris appeared forceful and in charge, which is what Americans want to see in their president. As Baier showed, she had struggled last week to answer the question of where she and the incumbent differed. Her new and better answer — “my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency” — will be the sound bite that lingers. It’s a serviceable one on a critical question for many voters.</p><p>Similarly, on immigration, she kept returning to Trump killing the bipartisan border deal earlier this year. This answer won’t win her the debate over immigration, but it does help cut into Trump’s significant polling advantage on the issue.</p><p>Harris did best when she reinforced the point that Trump is unfit to be president. When Baier showed a clip of Trump trying to back away from his attacks on fellow Americans as “the enemy within,” she pounced and drove home her point by forcefully arguing that Trump’s vice president and his national security team when he was president don’t want him anywhere near the Oval Office again. When she cited the concerns of Gen. Mark Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I wished she had repeated his full comment about Trump: “He’s a fascist to his core.”</p><p>Even Americans who don’t know much history surely have heard of the guys grandpa fought against.</p><p>Most important, Harris reinforced her theme that she’s strong and that Trump, by dodging tough interviews and kissing up to dictators, is weak. Drawing that contrast is a good closing argument. On some level, people know that underneath their bluster, bullies are cowards.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="16" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2RjMmExOGQ0LTFkODktNWU1Yy05ODBmLWJjYWI0M2IxNDcyMg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#trumps-rallies-are-a-world-unto-themselves" data-source-id="100000009765880"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/katherine-miller"><img alt="Katherine Miller" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/opinion/katherine-miller/katherine-miller-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-16T21:53:56.151Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 16, 2024, 5:53 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p><em>Each Wednesday in The Point through the election, Katherine Miller highlights a revealing moment from a stump speech on the campaign trail.</em></p><p>Over the weekend, I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/opinion/trump-second-term.html" title="">wrote</a> about the darker turn in Donald Trump’s recent rally speeches and how that could flow into governance (as it did before) and politics (as it has changed the G.O.P.), despite what a reluctant or ambivalent Trump voter might <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/elections/trump-promises-extreme-rhetoric.html" title="">want out</a> of a second Trump presidency. And that’s a core way I think about what candidates say on the trail.</p><p>But there are also some technical questions in a race this close: What actually matters? Which ads move certain kinds of voters? What kinds of campaign events persuade or turn out voters?</p><p>I thought a lot about this when traveling recently in North Carolina and Georgia for Democratic and Republican campaign events and watching TV afterward, with the nonstop ads. This week Trump had one of the stranger campaign events of the cycle, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trumps-bizarre-music-session-reignites-questions-mental-acuity-rcna175464" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just playing music</a> for a full half-hour while onstage for what was supposed to be a town-hall-style event in Pennsylvania. Why would he do this? His rallies and events are very central to his political project, as well as kind of a world in and of themselves.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I went to a Trump rally at the Wilmington, N.C., airport. It was a hot, clear Saturday afternoon, and because the rally was outside on the tarmac with essentially no shade, the heat and sun became pretty intense, especially as the hours wore on.</p><p>But just before Trump spoke, his plane did a flyby over all of us while the campaign blasted the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/00Y9r5SfbDdEjJhNg7laQr?si=7bbcc9219bbd454f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anthem</a> from “Top Gun,” as happens in the movie. It was one of those sort of unbelievable things that nearly begged people to take out their phones and record it, and near as I could tell, most people did. It was very memorable and was clearly much more planned than the odd music night situation, but it also seemed to exist just to exist, to entertain.</p><p>After he landed, Trump spoke for a good long while, speaking darkly about migrants and crime and unveiling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/25/opinion/thepoint#trump-abortion-dreamworld-protector" title="">this line</a>: “Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.”</p><p>After the rally, I wondered what people who were there were telling people who didn’t attend. Would they talk about the flyover? The heat? The dark immigration claims? Some joke or line of Trump’s about Kamala Harris? It was a long day, and a lot happened at the rally. What would remind or move people to vote or dissuade them from doing so?</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="15" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2QzY2RkMTk3LWI2ZjYtNTI3Zi1hZWRhLTgwYjI5ZjUzYjZmZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#trump-fox-news-town-hall" data-source-id="100000009765176"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessica-grose"><img alt="Jessica Grose" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/opinion/Jessica_Grose_newsletter/Jessica_Grose_newsletter-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-16T18:46:51.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 16, 2024, 2:46 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Elijah Nouvelage/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>If you were an alien who touched down from outer space knowing nothing about American politics and you were forced to watch Donald Trump’s women-only town hall on Fox News on Wednesday morning, you could easily be bamboozled into thinking that Trump holds the sort of women-friendly family policy positions long championed by Democrats.</p><p>As has become typical, Trump’s statements were messy and confusing, but if you knew little about the issues at hand and listened to the raucous cheers of the audience, you might think he was supportive of a woman’s right to choose and access to I.V.F.</p><p>One woman questioned Trump about abortion. She stated plainly, “Women are entitled to do what they want to and need to do with their bodies.” And then she asked, “Why is the government involved in women’s basic rights?”</p><p>Trump responded by saying he personally believes in exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest and the health of the mother, and repeated the lie that “everybody” wanted abortion to be a states-rights issue. “Nobody wanted it to be in the federal government,” he said. “What they wanted it was back in the states and that’s what we have it, and the states are going more liberal.” (In much of the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" title="">they are not</a>.)</p><p>To her credit, the host of the event, Harris Faulkner, quietly pushed back, saying, “Some of them are not.” But Trump — and his audience — didn’t appear to be listening.</p><p>He sounded similarly supportive when asked whether abortion bans would restrict access to I.V.F. “I got a call from Katie Britt, a young, fantastically attractive person from Alabama,” he said of the United States senator. He said that he didn’t know what I.V.F. was until she explained it to him, but once he knew what it was, he was totally in favor of it — he even called himself <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/politics/ivf-donald-trump-abortion" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the “father of I.V.F.”</a> “We want fertilization, and we’re out there on I.V.F. even more than them,” he said, referring to Democrats. (In recent months, congressional Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/us/politics/ivf-bill-senate-vote.html" title="">have blocked bills</a> that would protect I.V.F. access.)</p><p>That Donald Trump is morally flexible enough to claim political beliefs that don’t match his party’s actual policy choices isn’t news. But what was especially surprising to me was how willing Fox News anchors and audiences are to pretend that Trump — and by extension the Republican Party — has always promoted women’s issues.</p><p>Kayleigh McEnany, whose show aired directly after the town hall, interviewed Faulkner in a sort of postgame wrap-up. Faulkner said, “Women absolutely have to be at the table when we talk about things like safety and abortion. And former President Trump said, ‘I’m so glad you asked that question. A woman does have the right for her body and then this is why I gave that right back to the states.’” I felt as if I was in an alternative universe — like the alien who dropped out of the sky.</p><p>I don’t think that the remaining persuadable voters will be swayed by this late-breaking swerve toward the center.

Manitta, who hails from Auburn, N.Y., moved to Wiltshire for work and stuck around. Now she’s the global press secretary for Democrats Abroad, the overseas arm of the Democratic National Committee, which sets up tables at farmers markets and touristy areas in London with information about how Americans living abroad can cast a ballot from afar.</p><p>“People are working every minute they have, seven days a week, around their normal lives to do this work,” she told me in a phone conversation. “We are so concerned.”</p><p>An estimated 4.4 million Americans live overseas — from digital nomads to U.S. soldiers to students who are studying abroad. According to the <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Voting Assistance Program</a>, more than 1.2 million Americans living abroad were registered to vote in 2020. They make up an overlooked constituency that can pack a surprising political punch. In 2020, 18,475 overseas voters cast ballots in Georgia, a state President Biden won by 12,670 votes, while 18,435 cast ballots in Arizona, where Biden won by 10,457 votes.</p><p>Last week, in a bid to woo these voters, Donald Trump pledged to address their greatest grievance: double taxation. Americans are virtually alone in the world in having to file taxes, even if they don’t live in the United States. It’s a big bureaucratic headache, especially for “accidental” Americans who simply happen to have been born in the country but haven’t lived there for years. As in his previous tax cut proposals, he didn’t say how much it would add to the deficit, or in this case how he would prevent Americans from moving abroad to low-tax countries just to save on their tax bills.</p><p>“We have been working on this problem for over 10 years, with other American organizations,” Manitta told me. (Exceptions for health insurance requirements was another big issue for them.) But she is unmoved by Trump’s campaign promises. “If he didn’t do anything before, when he was in office,” she asked, “what makes people think he’s going to do something this time?”</p><p>If you live abroad, it’s not too late to exercise your right to vote: Go to the nonpartisan website <a href="https://votefromabroad.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Votefromabroad.org</a> to find out how.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="12" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2I1ZDU0ODM5LWUxYTYtNWEwYS1iYWE2LTMxZGYyZjE3NzllMw=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#charlamagne-harris-interview-detroit" data-source-id="100000009763776"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-firestone"><img alt="David Firestone" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/10/reader-center/author-david-firestone/author-david-firestone-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-15T23:19:59.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 15, 2024, 7:19 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Right off the bat, Charlamagne tha God asked Kamala Harris in his radio town hall Tuesday afternoon about her tendency to stick to her scripts. “I would say, you’re welcome,” she laughed. “That would be called disciplined.”</p><p>And if Charlamagne thought that opening exchange might loosen her up a little bit, might take her off the familiar path and lead her instead toward a real emotional connection with his huge audience of millennial and mostly Black listeners, he didn’t know quite whom he was interviewing. For an hour in front of Charlamagne’s microphone in Detroit, Harris was as disciplined as ever, unspooling a solid case for why she would be a vastly better president for Black America than Donald Trump, while sidestepping a few tough questions and frustrating questioners who just wanted her to get a little angry.</p><p>It’s who she is. She may be doing more interviews in the final days of the campaign, but she is clearly determined not to get pushed off her message, either by friendly interviewers like Charlamagne or more adversarial journalists. Those qualities may make her an equally firm and determined president, should she win, but she will never win any awards for being a free-flowing and spontaneous campaigner.</p><p>When one questioner asked her stance on reparations, she said it should be studied, then quickly pivoted to her economic agenda. When Charlamagne asked whether it was true that she had locked up thousands of Black men as the district attorney in San Francisco, she said that was false and began to describe herself as “the most progressive in California,” before seemingly realizing that could be used in a Republican attack ad and quickly making it clear that she was talking about not criminalizing marijuana use.</p><p>Harris is very aware that her support among Black men is soft, which is why she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/harris-policies-black-men.html" title="">unveiled a plan on Monday to boost their economic fortunes</a>. But today’s politics requires her to carefully navigate the space between directly appealing to a specific demographic group she needs and not alienating equally needed white suburban voters who don’t really want to hear anything about reparations or financial breaks that won’t benefit them.</p><p>And so she made the interview a kind of State-of-the-Union speech of important but not terribly exciting ideas that she talks about all the time. Using community banks to make forgivable loans of up to $20,000 for Black entrepreneurs, because they lack access to venture capital. Increasing child tax credits, having Medicare cover the cost of home health care and helping with down payments for first-time home buyers.</p><p>These are the details of how social programs work, but they don’t make for great radio. Charlamagne tried to get her to say Trump should be imprisoned for starting the Jan. 6 riot, but she carefully said that was up to the Justice Department and she wouldn’t weaponize it the way Trump would.</p><p>The closest she came to an unscripted moment was when Charlamagne asked if it’s possible to use the word fascism to describe Trump’s vision, and she laughed and said, “Yeah, we can say that.” But she wouldn’t go any further, and a minute later she was back on comfortable ground, describing how she grew up in the Black church.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="10" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2U2MzVlYmU4LTU4YjMtNWY2MS05YTczLWVmNjU4ZjYzMjY0OQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#biden-aid-weapons-restriction" data-source-id="100000009763443"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-kristof"><img alt="Nicholas Kristof" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-15T21:25:58.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 15, 2024, 5:25 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>With Israel clamping down on food shipments to Gaza, the Biden administration is finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/world/israel-lebanon-iran-hezbollah-news?smid=url-share#us-israel-military-aid-gaza-improvements" title="">warning Israel</a> to ease up or risk a suspension of some military aid.</p><p>In a letter released on Tuesday, the administration gave Israel 30 days to allow more humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza or else face consequences. That’s a welcome indication that President Biden is belatedly enforcing U.S. law, which bars military assistance to countries that block American humanitarian aid.</p><p>As a State Department official, Matthew Miller, put it, “It’s just a plain reading of U.S. law.” The problem is that until now, Biden didn’t seem able to read the law plainly.</p><p>In April the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department’s refugee bureau <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decided that Israel was blocking aid</a>. Yet Biden somehow concluded that Israel was not in violation of the law, and weapons largely continued to flow to Israel, magnifying the devastation in Gaza.</p><p>More recently, Israel has dialed back the flow of food into Gaza even more sharply. The State Department says that the level of aid entering Gaza in September was lower than at any other point since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel. There has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/14/gaza-jabalya-hamas-starvation-israel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debate</a> about whether Israel is pursuing <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/israel-gaza-palestine-what-generals-plan" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one retired general’s proposed starvation strategy</a>, particularly in northern Gaza.</p><p>I admire much of Biden’s foreign policy, but I have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/opinion/biden-gaza-war.html" title="">very critical</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/opinion/biden-israel-war.html" title="">his failure</a> to use weapon shipments as leverage to force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to listen to Washington’s calls for restraint and a cease-fire. Without leverage, Biden has been reduced to pleading with Netanyahu and having his pleas humiliatingly rebuffed. Biden’s weakness has made America complicit in the resulting humanitarian tragedy.</p><p>So it’s a welcome indication that Biden may finally be willing to use leverage, instead of hugs, to influence Netanyahu. But the 30-day period, which means nothing is likely to happen until after the U.S. election, makes one wonder if this isn’t more performative than substantive, meant to help Vice President Kamala Harris win Arab American votes in Michigan.</p><p>I hope Biden is finally serious; more than 3,100 children in Gaza under the age of 5 have been killed, according to Save the Children, and UNICEF has called Gaza the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/opinion/gaza-israel-deaths.html" title="">most dangerous place to be a child</a>. But after a year in which he has allowed Netanyahu to walk all over him, skepticism seems reasonable.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="9" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzg5ZDI2ZjM0LTQyNTUtNTRkZi1hY2JkLTViNDE1M2Q4OWEzNA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#trump-cognitive-decline" data-source-id="100000009762648"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michelle-cottle"><img alt="Michelle Cottle" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbStandard-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/opinion/michelle-cottle-circular/michelle-cottle-circular-thumbLarge-v4.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-15T20:06:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 15, 2024, 4:06 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>I like a dance party as much as the next gal, but Donald Trump’s weird <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/trump-town-hall-dj-music.html" title="">rally-turned-D.J.-session</a> on Monday night has me more than a little concerned.</p><p>I am far from the only one. The former president, who is increasingly steering clear of public events that aren’t guaranteed safe spaces (he <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/15/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/trump-cancels-interview-cnbc-squawk-box-00183698" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">canceled yet another TV interview</a> on Tuesday), had arranged for a nice, friendly town hall: Field a few softball questions from fans. Wave, smile, throw out some random asides. Do that weird old-guy hip shake. (I swear I’ve seen my dad do the exact same moves.)</p><p>But after three or four questions, things went off the rails. Two attendees dropped from the heat. No one seemed to know what to do. And suddenly Trump announced that the rest of the event would be devoted to enjoying his campaign’s playlist. He stood onstage swaying and smirking, occasionally moving his arms, for just shy of 40 minutes.</p><p>It was, gently put, troubling — an extended senior moment from a man who would be, if elected, America’s oldest president at the end of his term. Even Kristi Noem looked unsettled, and she killed her puppy when it acted up.</p><p>Voters deserve to know if Trump is slipping cognitively. In addition to backing out of appearances and running a lower-energy campaign than in previous cycles, Trump’s stream-of-consciousness weave is fast degenerating into something at times incomprehensible. (Except for the racist bits. Those still come across.)</p><p>I am not a cognitive specialist. I am not here to diagnose the former president. But I can certainly speak to the concerns of regular Americans — how it looks to those of us who have gone through time and heartbreak with loved ones experiencing cognitive troubles, whether temporary or progressive. Among the various possibilities weighing on some of our minds:</p><ul><li><p>At 78, like so many others his age, Trump may have entered a period of permanent cognitive decline. Without a proper medical work-up, it’s impossible to say. But the specter of an irreversible slide is what is seriously freaking out some voters — and should be freaking out Trump’s own team. This is what many Americans were pretty sure was happening with President Biden, even if it manifested differently. It is no more comforting to consider the possibility with Trump, and it shouldn’t be downplayed simply because Trump’s possible senior moments are less spacey and more ragey.</p></li><li><p>Trump may be suffering a temporary decline because of the stress and grueling schedule of a presidential campaign, possibly combined with two assassination attempts and his ongoing legal dramas. He is auditioning for arguably the most stressful job in the world — one that, as we so often noted with Biden, takes a visible toll even on presidents decades younger.</p></li><li><p>There has also been a bit of speculation that this is part of some clever scheme to help him avoid tough questions or awkward encounters — or at least keep people focused on something other than his bone-deep dishonesty and scary antidemocratic tendencies. But there have been too many times he has lost the thread of his thoughts altogether for this to be four-dimensional chess.</p></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, we have too much experience watching politicians fall prey to the vagaries of aging. We may never understand what exactly is going on with Trump, because his people are so intent on shielding him — in much the same way that Republicans accused Biden’s people of shielding him. But we know the red flags. Time and chance happen to everyone, regardless of his or her political leanings. To pretend otherwise is to court disaster.</p><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Oct. 15, 2024</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of South Dakota’s governor.

Here’s what we’re looking at this week:</em></p><ul><li><p>In the final three weeks of a presidential campaign, candidates usually have one big televised debate left, a last chance to break through to a large audience of voters with a memorable quip, a compelling idea or a defensive strategy that takes opponents down a peg. During those final weeks, candidates also make their closing argument to voters — the best case for why to elect them — which typically gets a full airing in that last debate and then gets amplified during the campaign rallies, events and TV ads through Election Day.</p></li><li><p>That was the case for Joe Biden in his last debate against Donald Trump, on Oct. 22, 2020, when he conveyed steadiness and maturity in the face of a fusillade of Trump rants. It was the case for Trump against Hillary Clinton in their Oct. 19, 2016, debate, when he hammered away at illegal immigration and portrayed her as corrupt and untrustworthy — conjuring up doubts that James Comey would soon reinforce with some voters.</p></li><li><p>But there’s no October presidential debate this year, unless Trump changes his mind and takes up Kamala Harris’s offer to have one. As a result, this presidential campaign felt stalled in recent weeks, as both candidates held rallies with friendly audiences and sat down to take questions mostly from friendly interviewers (though Harris had more guts than Trump to do “60 Minutes”).</p></li><li><p>Now comes this curveball: Harris will do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/business/media/fox-news-kamala-harris-interview.html" title="">a half-hour interview on Wednesday night with Fox News’s Bret Baier</a>, who’s no Democrat’s idea of a pushover reporter. Now, Harris parries well and knows how to run out the clock, but she’s likely to come in for a grilling, with no guarantees of success.</p></li><li><p>It’s a savvy move by Harris. The usual strategy of safe closing arguments before friendly audiences in the final weeks isn’t going to cut it in this tight race. Both Harris and Trump know they have more work to do to win this race, and Harris is the one trying to do the work.</p></li><li><p>The most important goals at this stage — with early and mail-in voting underway — are to energize your base and expand your voter coalition. Harris isn’t going to win over tons of voters who watch Fox News. But I think her appearance could help more than hurt her, especially with undecided voters and those who aren’t hard-core partisans; they may like her grit in taking questions on Fox News. “Fortitude,” “courage” and “confidence” were words of praise for Harris that I heard in our latest focus group, which will be published on Wednesday, from women who backed Trump in 2020. I think she can still poach some of these women and other voters. (She’s also doing an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/harris-breakfast-club-charlamagne-tha-god.html" title="">Charlamagne Tha God</a> on Tuesday, in part to help her support among Black men.)</p></li><li><p>Trump, too, is going on Fox News on Wednesday, and it’s an unusual format: an all-female audience that is expected to ask him questions about abortion and child care. I’ll be watching his performance to see if he doubles down on his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/opinion/kamala-harris-donald-trump-security.html" title="">protector-of-women messaging</a>, but it’s Harris who I think could catch more voters’ attention by gambling in her final three weeks on a high-risk, high-reward play.</p></li></ul></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="6" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzYzNDZiMDgwLTg1MWYtNWExYi1iZWU0LTYzYzM3Mzc5YjI0MA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#hurricane-milton-misinformation-denialism" data-source-id="100000009754946"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-wallace-wells"><img alt="David Wallace-Wells" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/reader-center/author-david-wallace-wells/author-david-wallace-wells-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-11T20:00:03.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 11, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>It was not two weeks ago that Hurricane Helene made landfall 160 miles from Tampa, Fla., and moved northward from there, killing more than 200 people and producing damages now estimated at $175 billion. That is almost half as much money as the green energy investments the Congressional Budget Office projected would be paid out over a decade by the Inflation Reduction Act, often called the largest and most consequential climate legislation ever passed anywhere in the world. So half of that decade-long estimate, in damages, accrued from one single storm.</p><p>As Kate Aronoff <a href="https://newrepublic.com/series/54/hurricane-milton-helene-harris-politicize" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> in The New Republic, the recent technocratic turn toward treating climate change as merely a matter of energy transition has left climate-conscious Democrats without great language to describe — or policy tools to defend against — the devastating impacts that will intensify in the decades ahead.</p><p>The damages from Hurricane Milton appear, at the moment, considerably smaller than those generated by Helene, thanks to the slight southward drift of the storm course. Tampa endured merely a thousand-year rain event, with more rainfall in a single hour than the city had ever recorded in any single month before. More than 100 tornadoes swept across the peninsula, too.</p><p>Even so, Milton was a kind of success story, in its way, and a testament to Florida’s experience with hurricane hazards. But the longer and more troubling legacy of these particular back-to-back hurricanes might be how quickly the storms themselves have been weaponized, not merely to make familiar partisan points but also as part of much larger and darker information wars.</p><p>This phenomenon has already generated <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/hurricane-helene-misinformation-ai/680160/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">valuable commentary</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/from-hurricanes-113584958" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concern</a>. But the most striking illustration of it, for me, was a bulletin issued by Chuck Edwards, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, as he tried to clarify a long list of delusional stories for his constituents:</p><p>“Hurricane Helene was NOT geoengineered by the government,” “Local officials are NOT abandoning search and rescue efforts to bulldoze over Chimney Rock,” “FEMA is NOT stopping trucks or vehicles with donations,” “FEMA has NOT diverted disaster response funding to the border or foreign aid,” and “FEMA cannot seize your property or land.”</p><p>For decades, climate advocates believed that warming itself would ultimately defeat denial — that once a disaster of inarguable intensity arrived, the world would belatedly wake up. In recent years, as I’ve watched unprecedented-seeming event after unprecedented-seeming event, I’ve wondered whether our stronger adaptive reflex wasn’t toward simple normalization, allowing us to navigate ever harsher and more unpredictable climate realities while telling ourselves, on balance, that everything is fine.</p><p>But the paranoid flotsam crowding the floodwaters in the wake of Helene suggests a third possibility, that an increasing number of increasingly intense disasters will push at least some of us, and possibly many of us, deeper into cocoons of paranoid delusion. Far from the “return of the real,” climate change now looks as much like a portal offering at least some of us an Infowars-style exit from an ever harsher reality.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="4" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2FhMmQ5YjUxLTA1YWUtNTZlNS04MzQ0LTBhODZhNmFlNTc0MQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#nobel-peace-nuclear-survivors" data-source-id="100000009757196"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/w-j--hennigan"><img alt="W.J.

Though the damage occurred within a split second, the physical and psychological injuries remain nearly eight decades later.</p><p>My colleagues and I spent several days with hibakusha, as the nuclear survivors are called in Japan, listening to their recollections of living through those days and how they wrestle with those memories today for our Opinion series <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/10/opinion/nuclear-weapons-nytimes.html" title="">At the Brink</a>, about the modern nuclear threat. (It was the second consecutive year that Times Opinion brought to light the subject of a Nobel Peace Prize winner’s work shortly before the award. Last year’s winner was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/opinion/narges-mohammadi-iran-women.html" title="">Narges Mohammadi, the Iranian human-rights activist</a>.)</p><p>With an average age of 85, the remaining survivors clearly recognized the importance of communicating their experiences and lingering trauma to future generations. It’s imperative, each one said, that world leaders can never be allowed to unleash such a catastrophe on innocent people again.</p><p>“The hibakusha help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2024/press-release/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in its announcement</a>.</p><p>The committee went on to applaud Hidankyo and other hibakusha’s efforts to emphasize the nuclear taboo, which hasn’t been broken since 1945. But the committee went on to point out the alarming fact that this taboo is currently under tremendous pressure.</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/04/opinion/nuclear-war-prevention.html" title="">a concern Times Opinion shares</a> as the world’s nine nuclear powers expand and enhance their arsenals. Proliferation by new nations is coming closer to reality, and threats to use nuclear weapons are becoming commonplace.</p><p>Now, near the end of their lives, many hibakusha wonder whether the world has learned from their pain or whether a similar fate will befall another generation. Keiko Ogura was 8 when the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.</p><p>“Now what survivors worry about is to die and meet our family in heaven,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/06/opinion/hiroshima-nagasaki-atomic-bombing.html" title="">she told us</a>. “I heard many survivors say, ‘What shall I do? On this planet there are still many many nuclear weapons, and then I’ll meet my daughter I couldn’t save. I’ll be asked: Mom, what did you do to abolish nuclear weapons?’</p><p>“There is no answer I can tell them.”</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="3" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzA2MTJjMTMxLTBkMzgtNTVmOS04MDM5LTQwNzlmZTliNjc1ZA=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#supreme-court-senate-polls" data-source-id="100000009755343"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jesse-wegman"><img alt="Jesse Wegman" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbStandard-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/02/opinion/JesseWegman/JesseWegman-thumbLarge-v6.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-11T14:37:43.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 11, 2024, 10:37 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kent Nishimura/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>If you think the Supreme Court is out of control now, then the latest batch of polling should concern you.</p><p>I’m not talking about polls on the presidential race; I’m talking about the Senate.</p><p>According to a New York Times/Siena College poll, Republicans are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/us/politics/senate-polls-montana-florida-texas.html" title="">likely to regain control</a> of the Senate after November. The chamber controls the fate of the most important presidential nominees, including Supreme Court justices. How big a deal is this?</p><p>Let’s roll back the tape to the 2014 midterm elections, when Republicans reclaimed the Senate for the last two years of President Barack Obama’s term. To go by the record-low turnout that year, few Americans seemed to grasp the significance of the outcome. Then, in February 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly. Within hours, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, vowed that he would not even hold a hearing on Scalia’s replacement until after a new president took office, nearly a year later. It was unprecedented, outrageous and, I hate to admit, technically legal.</p><p>More to the point, it paid off. The vacancy that should have been Obama’s to fill was instead handed to Donald Trump, who put the ultraconservative Neil Gorsuch on the bench. Almost four years later, McConnell and the Republicans played the same trick in reverse, exploiting Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death to ram through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett only days before Election Day. Presto: The Supreme Court now has a 6-3 right-wing supermajority in a country where millions more Americans on average have preferred the Democratic presidential nominee in seven of the past eight elections.</p><p>No matter how low the public’s confidence in the Supreme Court falls, the post-Scalia rules of the game seem clear: If Republicans hold the Senate, they will never confirm the kind of justices likely to be nominated by a Democratic president. If, on the other hand, Republicans take both the Senate and the White House, they will almost surely get to replace the two oldest justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, with justices who are equally Trumpy but a generation younger, locking in a 6-to-3 court for decades. It would become a 7-to-2 court if one of the three liberals has to step down, possibly Sonia Sotomayor, who will soon be 70 and has battled health problems for years.</p><p>This should be a motivating force for those voters who are upset by the court’s hard-right swerve — up to 70 percent of Americans, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/new-poll-shows-majority-of-americans-believe-supreme-court-justices-put-ideology-over-impartiality" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to a recent Gallup poll</a>. It should be especially motivating to those in states with tight Senate races, like Montana, Texas and Florida, even if voters there have given up their hope of influencing the presidential race.</p><p>Whatever happens in those races, a Kamala Harris victory is the best way to ensure that the Supreme Court doesn’t veer even farther to the right in the next four years.</p></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzE0MzY5MmQyLWU5YjgtNThmZC04YzVkLTU2NDFhNmJlNDI2NQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/15/opinion/thepoint#adams-city-hall-resignations" data-source-id="100000009755171"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-gay"><img alt="Mara Gay" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbStandard.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/opinion/mara-gay-circular/mara-gay-circular-thumbLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 150w" sizes="40px" height="40" width="40" loading="lazy"/></a></p><div><p><span><time datetime="2024-10-10T20:54:02.000Z"><p><span aria-hidden="true" data-time="abs">Oct. 10, 2024, 4:54 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time></span></p></div></div></div><p>Just beneath the layer of cronies and loyalists Mayor Eric Adams has packed into New York’s City Hall is an army of public servants, highly skilled government workers most people have never heard of who are dedicated to making the city run as it should.</p><p>It is these New Yorkers who are now running the day-to-day operations of the city, after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">more than half a dozen senior Adams officials</a> have been pushed out, resigned or announced plans to resign in recent weeks amid criminal investigations into the mayor and his inner circle.</p><p>Adams finally showed some awareness of the value of these public servants this week when he announced the promotion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/nyregion/sheena-wright-resigns-eric-adams.html" title="">Maria Torres-Springer</a> as first deputy mayor and the nomination of <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/726-24/mayor-adams-the-intention-nominate-muriel-goode-trufant-serve-new-york-city-s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Muriel Goode-Trufant</a> as corporation counsel, the city’s chief lawyer.</p><p>The promotions are the first good news out of City Hall in weeks. Goode-Trufant is an experienced municipal lawyer. Torres-Springer is another well-respected public servant who has served under three mayors and led initiatives to build more affordable housing in the city, an uphill battle that might wither altogether in New York without the kind of leadership she is known to provide.</p><p>These are encouraging developments for New York. But in recent weeks six senior officials who oversee or run critical city agencies have resigned, some under pressure, or announced plans to step down:</p><ul><li><p>David Banks, the school chancellor</p></li><li><p>Sheena Wright, the first deputy mayor</p></li><li><p>Philip Banks III, the first deputy mayor for public safety</p></li><li><p>Edward Caban, the police commissioner</p></li><li><p>Ashwin Vasan, the health commissioner</p></li><li><p>Lisa Zornberg, chief counsel</p></li></ul><p>And on Thursday, The Daily News reported that Tom Donlon, the interim police commissioner who replaced Caban, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/10/10/interim-nypd-commissioner-thomas-donlon-step-down-jessica-tisch-adams/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was also expected to step down</a> after failing to pass a background check.</p><p>Even amid the flurry of new appointments and interim commissioners, questions about how well the city is really running in this extraordinary moment hang heavy in the air.</p><p>The most urgent point of concern among many current and former city officials is how much oversight and leadership City Hall is exercising over the uniformed agencies, particularly the Police Department, the Fire Department and the Corrections Department, which runs the city’s jails.</p><p>One significant test Torres-Springer will encounter is making sure the critical needs of city priorities, like housing and libraries, are properly represented in the upcoming January budget proposal. Adams’s budget director, Jacques Jiha, is known to be especially tightfisted, leaving it up to Torres-Springer to make sure key line items show up in the budget.</p><p>In normal times, managing the nation’s largest municipal government is a challenge, even for the most dedicated public servants. When your boss is an embattled mayor under criminal indictment and leaking political capital, it’s going to be a lot harder.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
