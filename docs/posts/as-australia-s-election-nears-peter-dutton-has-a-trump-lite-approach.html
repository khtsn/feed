He has lashed out at a “woke brigade” of banks, grocery stores and a chain of pubs for addressing environmental and Indigenous issues. He has lamented about young men being <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/peter-dutton-warns-men-have-had-enough-of-diversity-hires/news-story/8826192e181e20d007242c1ce0dd2295" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“disenfranchised and ostracized”</a> by diversity initiatives.<span>  </span>And he’s set up a shadow minister for government efficiency.</p><p>Mr. Dutton, the head of Australia’s main center-right political party, hopes to oust Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in an election that must be held by May 17. Mr. Albanese has been under pressure to rein in post-pandemic inflation, and Mr. Dutton has accused him of being too distracted by “woke” issues, like Indigenous rights, to address high prices and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/655625/australians-housing-crisis-dreams-turn-nightmares.aspx" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unaffordable housing</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Albanese has <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/media/tax-cuts-help-australians-cost-living" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rolled out a tax cut</a> and said the government was getting a handle on underlying inflation, which has fallen to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/29/australias-underlying-inflation-rate-falls-to-32-to-bolster-case-for-rba-rate-cut-next-month" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three-year low of 3.2 percent</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A protest against Australia Day in Melbourne in January.

Fifty-seven percent of respondents in the NewsPoll survey said they disapproved of his performance. A head-to-head comparison showed Mr. Dutton closing in on Mr. Albanese, a sign that his political messaging was getting at least some traction.</p><p>“What I like about Dutton is he doesn’t sit on the fence,” said Louise Pridham, 57, a retired nurse who lives in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla. She and her husband, Nigel Pridham, a 57-year-old builder, said they were not Trump fans but felt validated by some of Mr. Dutton’s messaging, which Mr. Pridham acknowledged had a Trump-like quality.</p><p>Ms. Pridham said more people she knew seemed to be appreciating Mr. Dutton’s bluntness. “He says as it is. There’s no wokeness in it.”</p><p>The parallels between Mr. Trump and Mr. Dutton, a 57-year-old former policeman known for his tough stances on <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-16/dutton-calls-to-slash-permanent-migration-program/103853394" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immigration</a> and <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/theyre-not-refugees-dutton-says-queensland-tamil-family-will-be-deported/qq3eb587m" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asylum seekers</a>, are drawn by both <a href="https://www.ginarinehart.com.au/australias-trump-the-push-for-peter-dutton-to-embrace-donald-trumps-campaign-style/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supporters</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/30/australia-support-donald-trump-peter-dutton-election" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critics</a>.

In 2019, <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ooh1fq7e/production/1d047557e5f5e0318ca6af5905f14ac713515734.pdf/Public-opinion-in-the-age-of-Trump-The-United-States-and-Australia-compared.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a survey found</a> that the conservative base in Australia was far more ideologically aligned with Hillary Clinton backers in the United States than with Trump supporters. Last year, barely a fifth of Australian voters <a href="https://poll.lowyinstitute.org/charts/2024-us-presidential-election-harris-trump/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a survey that they would have chosen Mr. Trump over then-Vice President Kamala Harris if the U.S. election were up to them.</p><p>Mr. Dutton made clear his distaste for “wokeness” as early as 2021, when as defense minister he <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/we-are-not-pursuing-a-woke-agenda-dutton-bans-special-morning-teas-at-defence-after-idahobit-20210521-p57u2g.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banned events</a> where staff members wore rainbow-colored clothing to support L.G.B.T.Q. awareness.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Two years later, conservatives were energized by a watershed moment in Australia’s culture wars.

In recent years, people who see it as a celebration of brutal colonial oppression of the Aboriginal population have called for abolishing the holiday or moving it to a different date.</p><p>But a survey conducted last month by The Sydney Morning Herald found that 61 percent of Australians supported keeping Australia Day as it is, up from 47 percent a year earlier.</p><p>Mark Kenny, the director of the Australian Studies Institute at the Australian National University, said Mr. Dutton’s rhetoric appealed to a working-class base, which, like its American counterpart, sees itself as having been abandoned by economic shifts, including the decline of manufacturing. Those voters felt let down by their traditional political leadership on the left, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“What you’ve got there is a kind of long-simmering sense of dissatisfaction, of being ignored, of not heard, being left behind,” he said. “When Dutton says ‘woke,’ it’s lazy and imprecise, but that doesn’t matter.

He has also indicated that he would not consider withdrawing Australia from the Paris Agreement, the international climate accord.</p><p>To Graeme Turner, emeritus professor of cultural studies at the University of Queensland, Mr. Dutton’s use of Mr. Trump’s words and rhetoric seem a lot more opportunistic than substantive.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“I doubt you could find a politician who could define the word ‘woke,’” Mr. Turner said. “It’s become a really handy slogan as a way of smearing any idea they don’t like, as a way of pre-empting it from serious analysis.”</p><p>The sniping over Australia Day continued last week. Sussan Ley, the deputy leader of Mr. Dutton’s party, marked the holiday by likening the arrival of British colonizers to Elon Musk’s ambitions to settle Mars. “They did not come to destroy or to pillage,” <a href="https://sussanley.com/speech-australia-day-albury-nsw/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she said</a>, in comments that were promptly criticized and lampooned.</p><p>The day before, at the spot where Captain James Cook first landed in Australia in 1770 — now a national park — a smattering of families sprawled out on grassy knolls and enjoyed a leisurely, sunny afternoon.</p><p>“It wouldn’t matter to me if you change the date because it’s not that big a deal,” John Gallop said of the holiday that was causing so much fuss among politicians. He said it was his first visit to the site in more than 50 years of living in Sydney, and that he had only come at the urging of his wife, who is from the Philippines.</p><p>“There’s so much more we need to change in Australia,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">Victoria Kim</a> is the Australia correspondent for The New York Times, based in Sydney, covering Australia, New Zealand and the broader Pacific region.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/victoria-kim">More about Victoria Kim</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/anthony-albanese">Anthony Albanese</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/peter-dutton">Peter Dutton</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Tariffs:</strong> President Trump’s move to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-tariffs-global-economic-order.html">threatening to fracture a world economic order</a> that once revolved around a U.S. economy that prized open investment and free markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> Elon Musk said that Trump believes the U.S. Agency for International Development <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-usaid-agency.html">should be shut down</a>, adding to the questions over the administration’s plans for the agency.</p></li><li><p><strong>DOGE:</strong> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave Musk’s representatives at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">access to the federal payment system</a>, a powerful tool to monitor and potentially limit government spending.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-venezuela-temporary-protected-status.html">ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans</a> in the United States, leaving the population vulnerable to potential deportation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Government Web Pages:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/upshot/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html">More than 8,000 web pages</a> across more than a dozen U.S. government websites have been taken down, as federal agencies rush to heed Trump’s orders targeting diversity initiatives and “gender ideology.”</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
