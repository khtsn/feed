After that change takes effect on May 2, United States Customs and Border agents will begin to collect previously exempted tariffs on shipments worth less $800.</p><p>Hongkong Post said it would immediately stop accepting surface postal items containing goods to the United States.<span>  </span>It said it was taking the action in response to President Trump’s tariffs.</p></div></div>
