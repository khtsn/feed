As they were sworn in, the court clerk said Mr. Weinstein’s name and a woman gasped.</p><p>The judge dismissed more than half of that group after they said they had scheduling conflicts or that they could not be impartial in the trial of Mr. Weinstein, a Hollywood mogul whose name became synonymous with sexual abuse. And so went four days during which the judge, prosecutors and defense attorneys slowly winnowed nearly 300 people.</p><p>On Tuesday, for the second time in five years, a jury of 12 Manhattanites and six alternates was chosen to decide Mr. Weinstein’s fate.</p><p>The judge and lawyers sifted through dozens of people who displayed various degrees of shock, interest and opinion about Mr. Weinstein, whose fall amid accusations of sexual assault and harassment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/nyregion/weinstein-new-york-case-timeline-metoo.html" title="">propelled the #MeToo movement</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Weinstein, 73, faces two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act and one of third-degree rape after complaints by three women who said he assaulted them in 2006 and 2013.</p><p>He was convicted in 2020 of rape and criminal sexual act based on the complaints of two of the women and was sentenced to 23 years in New York prison. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/25/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-appeal" title="">his conviction was overturned</a> last year and a new trial was ordered. In the interim, prosecutors added a new indictment.</p><p>Mr. Weinstein has also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/us/harvey-weinstein-sentence-los-angeles.html" title="">convicted in California on sex-crime charges</a> and faces a prison term there. He is appealing the California conviction. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him.</p><p>The new trial began in Manhattan criminal court last week, when prosecutors and Mr. Weinstein’s legal team began selecting from several pools of eligible jurors.</p><p>In one group, a man reacted to hearing Mr. Weinstein’s name with his eyebrows shooting toward his hairline; the man excused himself after the judge instructed people to leave if they had serious scheduling conflicts or if they could not be objective.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Others were dismissed by prosecutors and defense lawyers.</p><p>While being questioned by a prosecutor on the second day, one man said he thought the #MeToo movement had gone too far. He told a prosecutor, Nicole Blumberg, that his feelings were based on a personal experience of seeing high school classmates accused of sexual assault when “it ended up being nothing.”</p><p>A woman chimed in, saying she had “the opposite feeling,” and that she believed the movement did not go far enough.</p><p>Both were dismissed.</p><p>Another man who had initially said he could be impartial had a change of heart. The man, an investment manager from the Upper East Side, said he had been “parsing” his feelings over two days and wanted to discuss his discomfort.</p><p>Earlier, one of the defense lawyers, Arthur L. Aidala, had asked the group what word came to their minds when they thought of Mr. Weinstein.</p><p>“The first word that came into my head was ‘pig,’” the man told the judge and lawyers. “I apologize, but I feel like a great sense of responsibility as a citizen and I take this stuff seriously.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He was dismissed.</p><p>Here is what we know about the 12 jurors, based on their statements in court:</p><p><strong>Juror 1</strong>, the foreman, was born in the Dominican Republic and came to New York in 1996.
