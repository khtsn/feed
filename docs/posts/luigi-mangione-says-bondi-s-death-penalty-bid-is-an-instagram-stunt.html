On April 1, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/luigi-mangione-death-penalty.html" title="">Ms. Bondi announced</a> in a news release that she had directed federal prosecutors to seek capital punishment in the case “as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.”</p><p>Mr. Mangione’s lawyers argued that Ms. Bondi’s real motive in making the announcement was to garner press attention, noting that she talked about her decision in a Fox News Sunday interview and “publicly released her order so she would have ‘content’ for her newly launched Instagram account.”</p><p>They said she had also violated longstanding Justice Department protocols to ensure such decisions were made fairly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The lawyers also said a request they had made to the Trump Justice Department to allow them three months to investigate and prepare a thorough submission arguing against death penalty in the case was ignored. The lawyers had been able to make written and oral presentations to the government only in January, in the waning days of the Biden administration.</p><p>“These are not normal times,” Mr. Mangione’s lawyers wrote. By directing prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York to seek the death penalty “without affording even a modicum of process,” the lawyers said, Ms. Bondi was “being consistent with the new culture of the highest levels of the Justice Department, one that values personal will over process, publicity over discretion and partisan politics over justice.”</p><p>Mr. Mangione <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/nyregion/bondi-federal-death-penalty-mangione.html" title="">has not yet been indicted in federal court</a> in Mr. Thompson’s killing, but he is being held on a criminal complaint with four counts, including using a firearm to commit murder, which carries a maximum potential sentence of death.</p><p>Mr. Mangione’s lawyers, in their filing, also argued that Ms. Bondi’s statements will “prejudice the grand jury” that is asked to hear the case and return an indictment against him.</p><p>A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing by Mr. Mangione’s lawyers, and a Southern District spokesman declined to comment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p><p>Glenn Thrush<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a Times reporter covering the federal courts and U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and the justice system more broadly.</p></div><div><p>Hurubie Meko is a Times reporter covering criminal justice in New York, with a focus on the Manhattan district attorney&#39;s office and state courts.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
