Analysts credited his use of TikTok and other social media for his strong showing.</p><p>Mr. Georgescu is set to face Elena Lasconi, a centrist mayor and former journalist, in a runoff on Dec. 8. She won 19.2 percent of the vote, slightly more than Marcel Ciolacu, the center-left prime minister.</p><p>The recount may disrupt the runoff. If the first-round results are not certified, Romania cannot move on to the second round.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Constitutional Court of Romania considered the case because Cristian Vasile Terhes, one of the presidential candidates, made a complaint, alleging irregularities.</p><p>The Supreme Council of National Defense, which oversees national security, <a href="https://www.presidency.ro/ro/media/comunicate-de-presa/sedinta-consiliului-suprem-de-aparare-a-tarii1732806042" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement on Thursday</a> that there had been “cyberattacks” aimed at undermining the voting process in Romania — a NATO member that shares borders with Ukraine — as well as social cohesion. The council is headed by President Klaus Iohannis and includes the prime minister and other senior members of the government.</p><p>“Romania, along with other states on NATO’s Eastern Flank, has become a priority for the hostile actions of some state and nonstate actors,” the statement said, singling out Russia.</p><p>It also criticized TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese company, saying the platform had violated electoral laws because it had not identified Mr. Georgescu as a candidate. On Tuesday, Romania’s National Audiovisual Council called on the European Commission to investigate the role of TikTok in the vote, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romanian-far-right-presidential-candidate-says-he-does-not-want-leave-nato-2024-11-27/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a>.</p><p>TikTok rebutted Romania’s claims in an emailed statement to The New York Times on Thursday. It said that Mr. Georgescu’s account was labeled a political account “in the same way as every other candidate on TikTok, and subject to exactly the same rules and restrictions.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>TikTok said that it was “categorically false to claim his account was treated differently to any other candidate.”</p><p>The platform added that it “took action” within 24 hours on videos that the Romanian authorities flagged because they “lacked identifiers that the candidates themselves were legally required to add.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voting at a polling station in Nuci, Romania, on Sunday.

Toni Grebla, the president of the country’s official electoral authority, said it would be “absolutely impossible” to finish the recount by Friday, which is when the court called for another hearing.</p><p>His agency, the Permanent Electoral Authority, oversees the organization and conduct of elections. He pledged to “analyze and comply” with the court’s decision, but he said that he had yet to receive it. Either way, he said, it would be an enormous logistical task to count nine million votes, stored across 42 warehouses.</p><p>“I don’t think this can be done overnight,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The World of TikTok</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Women Playing Games</strong><strong>:</strong> In a series of tongue-in-cheek TikTok videos purporting to highlight #WomenInMaleFields, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/style/women-in-male-fields-tiktok.html">female users are sharing stories of negative experiences dating men</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>TikTok Under Trump:</strong> TikTok is hoping that Donald Trump will prevent a U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned video app after promises to that effect on the campaign trail.
