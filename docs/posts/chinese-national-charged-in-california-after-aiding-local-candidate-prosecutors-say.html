The two discussed Mr. Sun’s effort to get the politician elected in 2022. Mr. Chen, who is identified in court documents as Jun Chen, asked Mr. Sun to prepare a report about the candidate that was sent to Chinese officials, according to a criminal complaint made public Thursday. The most recent draft of the report included a request for $80,000 from China to support pro-Beijing activities in the United States.</p><p>Mr. Sun is scheduled to appear in court Friday afternoon. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer. A phone number registered to Sun Yaoning was not in service.</p><p>Mr. Sun’s arrest and the sentencing in New York of Mr. Chen are part of an effort by federal prosecutors to curb attempts by China to influence local politicians in the United States. After setbacks in extending its influence in Washington, the Chinese government has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/world/asia/here-are-4-reasons-china-meddles-in-local-us-politics.html" title="">turned to America’s cities and states</a>, prosecutors say, hoping to nurture support for causes important to Beijing, such as curbing calls for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/nyregion/linda-sun-arrested-hochul.html" title="">autonomy for Taiwan</a>, opposing any democracy movement in Hong Kong and combating the fiercely anti-Communist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/falun-gong?page=10" title="">Falun Gong</a> spiritual movement. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Officials say that the Chinese government is reaching into smaller local elections as a long-term investment: Successful local officials often seek higher office and can make introductions to more senior politicians.</p><p>The arrest of Mr. Sun in Southern California suggests an expanding scope of Chinese government efforts to influence American elections, following a Times investigation focusing on a New York man with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/chan-china-nyc-influence.html" title="">criminal backround</a>, John Chan, who has close ties to the local Chinese consulate and worked to shape election outcomes at the city, state and congressional levels.
