Trump have portrayed themselves as champions of the cause this year.</p><p>Ms. Harris, an alumna of Howard University and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority, has often spoken about the role Howard and other schools play in building careers for underserved students.</p><p>As vice president, Ms. Harris also made a point of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/07/vice-president-harris-launches-nationwide-fight-for-our-freedoms-college-tour-to-mobilize-students-and-young-people-in-the-fight-for-their-rights/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">touring dozens of campuses</a>, including many historically Black and Hispanic schools, studying issues students said they found important.</p><p>“In Vice President Harris, we have an H.B.C.U. graduate, a true champion for our cause, and a fighter for our students,” said Representative Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat and the founder of the Congressional Bipartisan H.B.C.U. Caucus. “Her policy work expands the path to the middle class for students of color, and lifts the ceiling for all H.B.C.U. graduates.”</p><p>As president, Mr. Trump similarly made a point of advertising his efforts to support historically Black schools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In 2019, he signed a bill establishing more than $250 million in annual funding for historically Black schools that was ultimately embraced by many education advocacy groups, though he also drew fire for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/politics/historically-black-colleges-omarosa-trump.html" title="">proposing to selectively slash that funding</a> at other points.</p><p>But while Mr. Biden has showered attention on H.B.C.U.s and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/us/hbcu-colleges-universities.html" title="">presided over a relatively bright period</a> for them including an influx of funding from philanthropists, his repeated failure to secure a major overhaul and mass forgiveness of student debt has been a major source of disappointment even for many of the president’s allies.</p><p>Among the accomplishments he listed on Monday, Mr. Biden mentioned increases in Pell grants, which help fund education for lower-income students and which Congress expanded by as much as $900 per student annually.</p><p>But his most ambitious programs, such as the Saving on a Valuable Education plan, intended to help students graduate without punishing student debt loads, have met fierce resistance by Republican attorneys general and been stalled by legal challenges.</p><p>Despite representing just 3 percent of all postsecondary institutions, historically Black colleges and universities educate 40 percent of all Black engineers, 50 percent of all Black teachers and 80 percent of all Black judges, according to federal work force data.</p><p>“H.B.C.U.s have been prying open freedom’s gates for the past four years,” Mr. Biden said. “Kamala and I, with the help of all you and great leaders out there,” he continued, “are pushing right alongside them.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
