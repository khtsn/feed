Last week, Kim Yong-hyun, South Korea’s defense minister, called it “highly likely” that several North Korean soldiers had already been killed in the fighting, and that North Korea would send more troops to help Russia.</p><p>Moscow helped North Korea fight the Korean War seven decades ago by supplying weapons and pilots. Now, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/world/asia/north-south-korea-ukraine.html" title="">North’s aid to Russia</a> in a distant war is turning history back on itself. It is also, analysts said, strengthening its military preparedness on the Korean Peninsula at a time of growing tensions with South Korea​.</p><p>Since the Korean War, North Korea has not fought another major conflict. But it has sought opportunities to sell weapons and other military assistance to friendly countries. It sent pilots to aid North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Its <a href="https://plane-encyclopedia.com/cold-war/korean-peoples-airforce-pilots-deployed-during-the-yom-kippur-war/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pilots also flew</a> for Egypt in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. North Korea also sent <a href="https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2018_171.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">missile technicians</a> and, <a href="https://tass.com/world/864368" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Tass, the Russian state news agency</a>, two small units of combat troops to fight for the Assad regime during Syria’s civil war in 2016.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“It has been a pattern: When North Korea has sold weapons to countries at war, they sent personnel not only to help those countries use the weapons, but often also to fight there themselves,” said Yang Uk, a military expert at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “They don’t seem to like missing opportunities to fight in a war and gain experience.”</p><p>If North Korea sent ground troops to Ukraine, it would be “their first major war in decades, an opportunity where their officers could get a sample of how modern war is fought, including the use of drones,” Mr. Yang added. “They will study how the knowledge they gain there can be translated into the Korean theater.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Remains of a missile believed to have been made in North Korea that struck Kharkiv, Ukraine, in January.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Neither Ukraine nor South Korea has presented evidence of North Korean troops. NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, said Wednesday that the alliance did not have definitive information on that possibility.</p><p>American intelligence and military officials expressed some skepticism at the Ukrainian claims that North Korean mercenaries were now fighting, in significant numbers, against Ukrainian forces. But they said that they had little doubt that North Korean engineers and observers are in Russia and parts of Ukraine, in part to construct and operate the North Korean-made ballistic missiles that Russia has purchased.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There have been unconfirmed reports of North Koreans killed in Ukrainian attacks. But the American officials said that they were recruits. One official said they would not be surprised if North Korea sends troops — to train and perhaps to fight — but they did not yet have evidence.</p><p>Washington has repeatedly warned of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/world/europe/russia-north-korea-weapons-ukraine.html" title="">growing military cooperation between Russia and North Korea</a>, providing photographic evidence that weapons from North Korea, especially its KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, have been used against Ukraine.</p><p>The KN-23 is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/02/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear.html" title="">one of a series of nuclear-capable short-range ballistic missiles</a> North Korea has developed and tested in recent years. It would be one of the main weapons North Korea would use against South Korea should war break out on the Korean Peninsula, military experts said.</p><p>“From the battlefield use, North Korea will collect valuable data to improve its missiles’ effectiveness — data it can also use to help sell the missiles to foreign buyers,” said Yang Moo-jin, the president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.</p><p>Analysts in South Korea said that North Korea’s main personnel contribution to Russia’s war would be engineers and weapons advisers to help the Russian military operate its weapons, observe defects and collect data from their battlefield use. Many of the North Korean artillery shells and missiles are said to be of poor quality, turning out to be duds.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Some analysts doubted that North Korea would commit a large number of troops to the war in Ukraine anytime soon.</p><p>“That kind of operation requires extensive preparations by both sides, like those annual military exercises South Korea and the United States conduct,” said Park Won-gon, a political scientist at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.</p><p>North Korea is believed to have shipped thousands of shipping containers of artillery shells, missiles and other weapons to Russia since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, United States and South Korean officials say. In return, North Korea may seek Russia’s technological help for its nuclear and space programs, as well as opportunities to send its workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine and bring home urgently needed income, they said.</p><p>Under United Nations Security Council resolutions, countries are banned from employing North Korean workers or engaging in arms trade with the North.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>South Korean soldiers at a military parade in Seoul this month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Anthony Wallace/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Both Moscow ​and Pyongyang have denied ​engaging in arms shipments from North Korea.

It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.”</p><p>As North Korea has fueled its partnership with Russia, it has also turned increasingly hostile toward South Korea, demolishing all railway and road links between the two Koreas with dynamites this week in a symbolic gesture of declaring the South as an enemy state.</p><p>“The sense of being allied with Russia can embolden North Korea to become more aggressive toward South Korea,” Mr. Park said.</p><p>David E.
