Trump over his pick.</p><p>“I will be supporting President Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth,” Ms. Ernst said on <a href="https://whoradio.iheart.com/featured/simon-conway/content/2025-01-14-92-simon-conway-interview-with-senator-joni-ernst/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WHO News Radio 1040</a>, a station in Des Moines.</p><p>Her decision dramatically increases the likelihood that Mr. Hegseth will have enough votes to be confirmed by the Senate. Because Democrats are expected to oppose him en masse, Mr. Hegseth can afford to lose no more than three Republican votes. After Ms. Ernst’s announcement, only a handful of G.O.P. senators’ votes may be in play; Senators Susan Collins of Maine, John Curtis of Utah, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Todd Young of Indiana have not yet said how they will vote.</p><p>Ms. Ernst was seen as a potentially pivotal swing vote for Mr. Hegseth, whose candidacy has been complicated by allegations of sexual assault, public drunkenness and corporate mismanagement. Ms. Ernst, a survivor of sexual assault and the Senate’s first female combat veteran, has actively campaigned for expanding opportunities for female service members and was a leading G.O.P. voice agitating for changes to how the military handles sexual assault cases.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But it was clear during Mr. Hegseth’s confirmation hearing on Tuesday that despite her initial reservations about Mr. Hegseth’s bid, Ms. Ernst had come to embrace the idea of his leading the Pentagon. Though Ms. Ernst said at the start of her questioning that she was someone who would “pull no punches,” she did not challenge Mr. Hegseth — and at one point, even tried to rebut allegations that he had mismanaged the veterans nonprofits he ran.</p><p>Ms. Ernst’s later announcement that she would vote to confirm Mr. Hegseth completed an evolution that had been underway for weeks, amid a concerted pressure campaign to back his bid.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
