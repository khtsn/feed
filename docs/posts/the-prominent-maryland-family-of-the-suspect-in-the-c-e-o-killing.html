data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Long before the shooting, before the manhunt and before the arrest of Luigi Mangione in connection with the killing of a health care executive, the Mangione name was well-known around Baltimore.</p><p>The Mangiones, fueled by the competitive, combative spirit of their immigrant patriarch, built a formidable family business that made them a force in local politics and charity.</p><p>When Nick Mangione Sr., Luigi’s paternal grandfather, thought that he was being discriminated against at country clubs in the early 1970s because he was Italian, he bought his own golf resort. When he got tired of waiting for permission to build a second golf course at one of his clubs, he sent in bulldozers to begin clearing the land. And when one of his sons was cut from a local soccer team, Mr. Mangione barred the team’s coach from his country club.</p><p>“Nick Mangione is foremost identified as a family man,” Thomas J. D’Alesandro III, the former Baltimore mayor and late brother of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, told <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/1995/07/17/fiery-builder-has-softer-side/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Baltimore Sun</a> in 1995. “He is maybe a little rough around the edges and maybe with an aggressive personality, but a man with a big heart.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>When he died in 2008, the elder Mr. Mangione left behind 10 children, more than 35 grandchildren and a collection of business holdings, which now include two country clubs, a chain of nursing homes and a local conservative radio station. The Mangiones are longtime supporters of numerous local causes and institutions, including Loyola University Maryland and the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, where the high-risk obstetrics unit bears the Mangione name.</p><p>Until this week, those commercial and philanthropic pursuits were the principal sources of the family’s prominence. Then, on Monday, Luigi, 26, was arrested in Altoona, Pa., and charged with second-degree murder and other offenses in connection with the killing last week of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-funeral.html" title="">Brian Thompson</a>, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-shooting.html" title="">fatal shooting</a>, in Midtown Manhattan outside a hotel where UnitedHealthcare was hosting a conference for investors, stirred panic among employees at the company and other health insurers. An internal police report obtained by The New York Times said writing found on Mr. Mangione indicated that he saw the killing as a direct challenge to the health care industry’s “alleged corruption and ‘power games.’”</p><p>But prosecutors have not said what they believe the motive for the killing was, and much about Mr. Mangione is still being pieced together by investigators from the New York Police Department and other agencies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The 2016 valedictorian at a prestigious all-boys prep school in Baltimore, Mr. Mangione went on to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied computer science and earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Luigi Mangione delivering a speech as valedictorian in 2016 at the Gilman School in Baltimore.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Munchel/The Baltimore Sun, via TNS — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/united-healthcare-ceo-shooting-luigi-mangione.html" title="">Friends said</a> that he had been suffering from a painful back injury when, about six months ago, he suddenly and inexplicably went dark, prompting worried family members to ask his friends about his whereabouts.</p><p>On Monday night, a cousin, Nino Mangione, who is a Maryland state legislator, <a href="https://x.com/ninomangione42/status/1866318644608962906?s=46&amp;t=vvkQQNqnZMVA5mgDEZrsvw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a statement</a> on behalf of the family on X saying that the family was “shocked and devastated” by Luigi’s arrest.</p><p>“We only know what we have read in the media,” the statement read. “We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.”</p><p>On Tuesday evening, access to the Hayfields Country Club, a sprawling rural property north of Baltimore that is owned by the family and where Mr. Mangione’s parents also own a house, remained closed off to reporters.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It’s a very strong family,” Anthony J. Ambridge, a former Baltimore city councilman, said in an interview, noting that he had recently seen many members of the Mangione family during a fund-raiser for Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.</p><p>The story of the Mangione family in America begins far from swank charity events and verdant golf courses, in the gritty, rowhouse-lined streets of Baltimore’s Little Italy.</p><p>Born in 1925, Nicholas Mangione Sr., known as Nick, started working at age 11, after his father, an illiterate immigrant from Italy, died of pneumonia, leaving the family without income. During World War II, Nick Mangione joined the Navy and fought in the South Pacific before returning to Baltimore, where he began laying bricks and eventually built a successful contracting company.</p><p>In the early 1970s, Mr. Mangione and his wife, Mary, also the daughter of Italian immigrants, moved to the Baltimore suburbs to accommodate their growing family.</p><p>In 1978, they made what was considered a risky acquisition. With a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2003/09/04/family-makes-resort-its-turf/71d7e88a-9e80-48b8-b054-36d025603df9/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bank loan and about $750,000</a> of their own money, they bought the Turf Valley Country Club, in Howard County, outside Baltimore.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“People thought I needed money from the Mafia to buy this place,” Mr. Mangione once recalled to The Baltimore Sun. “They asked me what family I belonged to. I told them: ‘I belong to the Mangione family. The Mangione family of Baltimore County.’”</p><p>Over the years, the Mangiones converted the 1,000-acre club into one of the county’s few full-service resort and conference centers.</p><p>The gamble paid off. The venue, which is now known as the Turf Valley Resort, became a popular destination, hosting everything from high school proms to political fund-raisers.</p><p>Along the way, Mr. Mangione developed a reputation for a brusque business style. In 1988, a furor erupted when Mr. Mangione’s nephew, then a manager at the Turf Valley resort, was recorded using a racial slur after placing a call to a Black community leader and not realizing the answering machine was recording.</p><p>Facing a boycott and mounting public pressure, Mr. Mangione took a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1989/08/27/controversy-courts-turf-valley-owner/f81044b5-8d1b-4f51-a55f-d6de2f0038c8/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confrontational tack</a>. He rescinded a sizable pledge to a local hospital, he withdrew from some local school and charitable programs and he halted the complimentary practice time he had been providing to the high school golf team. And although Mr. Mangione fired his nephew for the racist remark, the man was rehired months later.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>It was just one of many clashes that Mr. Mangione had with local officials and the community over the years, especially as the family empire grew to include the Hayfields Country Club, in Cockeysville, Md., and the conservative radio station <a href="https://wcbm.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WCBM-AM 680</a>. The family also founded a nursing home and assisted living company called Lorien Health Services, which operates more than a dozen facilities in Maryland.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Mangione family owns the Hayfields Country Club, in Cockeysville, Md.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Josh Morgan/USA Today Network</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It’s a two-way street,” Mr. Mangione <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1989/08/27/controversy-courts-turf-valley-owner/f81044b5-8d1b-4f51-a55f-d6de2f0038c8/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said not long</a> after the Turf Valley episode. “If I am judged guilty and I’m not guilty, then they’re not friends of mine.”</p><p>There was a softer side to the Mangione family, too. Before her death in 2023, Mary Mangione, Luigi’s paternal grandmother, served on the board of the Baltimore Opera; as president of the Catholic Daughters of the Americas, a women’s organization; and as a trustee of the Walters Art Museum.</p><p>And friends of Mr. Mangione often refer to his fierce dedication to his family. All 10 of his children — five sons and five daughters — worked for the family company, taking over the business after the patriarch’s death in 2008.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>They include Luigi’s father, Louis Mangione, known as Lou, who still works for the family business. Luigi&#39;s mother, Kathleen, comes from another prominent local Italian American family. The daughter of Joseph N. Zannino Jr., who founded a funeral home in the heart of the Italian community in East Baltimore’s Highlandtown neighborhood, Kathleen now runs a boutique travel company.</p><p>In addition to Luigi, they have two daughters, MariaSanta, who is a physician-in-training in Texas, and Lucia, an artist in the Baltimore area.</p><p>In 1993, Louis and Kathleen purchased a home in Towson, a suburb outside Baltimore. Built in the 1960s, the four-bedroom, split-level house on a wide cul-de-sac was listed as Luigi’s address on a report that the police in Altoona filed on Monday after his arrest.</p><p>The Mangiones sold the house in June for $865,000, property records show. Speaking to a reporter on Tuesday night, one neighbor described the community as close-knit and family-oriented. Just a few days ago, she said, neighbors organized a tree lighting. Cups of hot chocolate were passed around, and Santa Claus also made an appearance.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->JoAnna Daemmrich<!-- -->, <!-- -->Juliet Macur<!-- -->, <!-- -->Campbell Robertson<!-- --> and <!-- -->Ashley Southall<!-- -->. <!-- -->Susan C.
