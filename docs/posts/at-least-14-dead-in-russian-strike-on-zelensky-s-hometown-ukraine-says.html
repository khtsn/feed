It was the latest in a series of Russian attacks on urban centers in recent days that have caused significant civilian casualties despite ongoing cease-fire talks.</p><p>Oleksandr Vilkul, head of Kryvyi Rih’s defense council, said on <a href="https://t.me/vilkul/10197" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> that five children were among the dead. He said the missile struck a residential neighborhood, with a playground nearby. Other officials warned the death toll could rise as rescuers continued to search the rubble for victims.</p><p>Friday’s attack came as Russia appears to have ramped up its attacks on civilian areas in recent weeks. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, was struck on Wednesday in an attack that <a href="https://t.me/dnipropetrovskaODA/20569" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">killed four people</a>. On Thursday, a Russian drone attack on the eastern city of Kharkiv also killed four people, <a href="https://t.me/ihor_terekhov/2335" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the city’s mayor</a>.</p><p>The number of civilian casualties could not be independently verified.</p><p>The unusually high toll on Friday comes as both countries have engaged in cease-fire negotiations partly aimed at reducing the war’s impact on civilians. Ukraine and Russia have so far committed to halting attacks on energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea, but these truces have yet to be implemented, with both sides accusing each other of violations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In a <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/13778" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post on social media</a>, Mr. Zelensky said the attack was proof that “Russia does not want a cease-fire, and we see it.”</p><p>His message included photos of the aftermath, showing bodies sprawled on the grass of what appeared to be a playground, some covered with rescue blankets. Around the playground, tree tops had been torn off and building windows shattered by the blast.</p><p>The Ukrainian officials said that in both the Wednesday and Friday strikes on Kryvyi Rih, Russia used ballistic missiles, high-speed weapons that have proven difficult for Ukrainian air-defense systems to intercept.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the War in Ukraine</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>P.O.W.s in Russia: </strong>Live drone footage allows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/europe/russia-ukraine-pow-executions.html">Ukraine to observe what it views as war crimes</a> unfold in real time, soldiers say.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Partnership: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/29/world/europe/us-ukraine-military-war-wiesbaden.html">The untold story</a> of America’s hidden role in Ukrainian military operations against Russia’s invading armies.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Uneasy Discord:</strong> The split between Europe and the United States over how to end the war is exposing a new, disorienting reality for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/europe/trump-europe-ukraine-russia.html">an alliance in trouble</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>L.G.B.T.Q.
