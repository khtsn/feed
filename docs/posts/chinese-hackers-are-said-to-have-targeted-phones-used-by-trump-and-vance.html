    <h1>Chinese Hackers Are Said to Have Targeted Phones Used by Trump and Vance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The revelation came in the closing stages of a campaign in which Mr. Trump’s team has also been targeted by Iranian hackers, who have repeatedly targeted his inner circle with spearphishing emails that were at least partly successful in gaining access to his campaign’s communications and documents.</p><p>Security around Mr. Trump has also been tightened as a result of assassination threats from Iran.</p><p>A Trump campaign spokesman did not directly address whether the phones used by Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance had been targeted. But in a statement, the spokesman, Steven Cheung, criticized the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris and sought to blame them for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign.</p><p>Earlier this year, security officials discovered the presence in American telecommunications systems of a China-affiliated hacking group. But investigators determined only recently that the hackers were targeting specific phone numbers, the officials said.</p><p>The infiltration by the hackers extends beyond the 2024 political campaign, with multiple people said to be targeted, people familiar with the investigation said, suggesting it could have far-reaching national security implications.</p><p>The investigation into the extent of the hacking and any national security damage is in its early stages. Whether such an attack could monitor or record phone conversations is difficult to know, and whether the hackers could read or intercept texts, for example, would depend in no small part on which messaging apps the targets used and how that data moved over the phone company’s systems.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> last month that a cyberattack linked to the Chinese government had infiltrated some U.S. broadband providers’ networks and might have been able to get information from systems used by the federal government in FISA court wiretap efforts.</p><p>Glenn Thrush<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div>
