This proves Congress can act. So why isn’t it using that same power to address hunger, health care costs or undeclared wars? The New York Times Opinion editor, Kathleen Kingsbury, explains.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>A lot happened this week. “Melissa came ashore like no other hurricane.” “Ordering the Pentagon to resume nuclear testing.” “Indiana is diving into the nationwide gerrymandering fight.” “Restructured into a for-profit company.” Here’s one thing you shouldn’t miss. On Tuesday, the Senate voted to block the tariffs that President Trump had imposed on Brazil, which had been contributing to higher prices on coffee, beef and bananas. So the president doesn’t really have the power to declare tariffs. Trump made it happen by declaring a national emergency over the summer. “What do you think of when you think of an emergency? You think of a war, a tornado, a famine. You don’t think of trade policy.” But what’s remarkable here is the Senate vote, which was 52 to 48. That means five Republicans joined the Democrats to block Trump’s tariffs, which makes you wonder: If these Republicans can stand up to Trump’s tariffs, why aren’t they showing backbone on preventing millions of Americans from going hungry? “SNAP benefits for millions of Americans is about to be suspended.” Preventing health care costs from spiking for 20 million Americans. “Could see the price they pay increase by an average of 75 percent.” Stopping the military from unilaterally blowing up boats and killing people when Congress hasn’t declared war. “This is the sixth boat the U.S. military has struck in international waters, killing at least 29 people.” Using their power of oversight to prevent abuse by federal agencies. “Federal agents descending on a Halloween parade in Chicago.” The answer can only be that congressional Republicans are OK with such things, because they have the power to stop them and they just aren’t doing it. Remember, the founders gave Congress some of the most important powers of government, including the power of the purse, the power of war and the power to regulate foreign commerce. They wanted Congress to be the most dominant branch. Today, it’s the weakest. But it’s their choice. And the fact that the Senate found enough of a spine to block Trump’s tariffs only shows how little they’ve done over the last nine months. It’s true that what we’re seeing from the executive branch can be shocking, but what we’re not seeing from Congress should be just as terrifying.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><header><div><div><div><nyt-betamax><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template><nyt-betamax-cover><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template><nyt-betamax-poster><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-jumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75" data-testid="betamax-poster" sizes="(width &lt; 740px) 95vw, 500px" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-master180.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 180w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-blog225.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 225w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-popup.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 282w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-slide.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 282w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-master315.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 315w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-tmagSF.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 362w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-blog427.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 427w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-blog480.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 480w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-master495.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 495w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-blog533.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 533w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-jumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 576w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-tmagArticle.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 592w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-articleLarge.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-master675.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 675w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-master768.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 768w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-master1050.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 1050w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/arts/31op-kk-DMT-thumb/31op-kk-DMT-thumb-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75 1152w" fetchpriority="high"/></template></nyt-betamax-poster></nyt-betamax-cover><nyt-betamax-overlay-controls><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template></nyt-betamax-overlay-controls><nyt-betamax-ads><template shadowrootmode="open" slotassignment="named"></template></nyt-betamax-ads></nyt-betamax></div><div><p><span>Five Republicans just voted with Democrats to block Trump’s tariffs.
