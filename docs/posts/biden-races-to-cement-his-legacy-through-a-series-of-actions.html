Trump to put in place his own.</p><p>The 11th-hour decisions, many of them executive actions, include measures on environmental justice, prison reform, immigration and foreign relations. Some are intended to preserve Mr. Biden’s legacy, while others are last-ditch efforts to expand his approach. Many are likely to be undone after Mr. Trump takes office next week.</p><p>The actions have gotten the attention of Mr. Trump, who said on social media earlier this month that Mr. Biden was “doing everything possible” to make the transition process “as difficult as possible.”</p><p>“Fear not, these ‘orders’ will be terminated shortly,” Mr. Trump added.</p><p>White House officials said Mr. Biden had directed his administration to ensure a smooth transition of power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Here is a look at some of the last major actions taken by Mr. Biden as he approaches the end of his presidency.</p><h2 id="link-33be3ac5">Coastal Drilling</h2><p>Mr. Biden last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/climate/biden-oil-gas-drilling-ban.html" title="">announced a ban</a> on new oil and gas drilling across more than 625 million acres of U.S. coastal waters as part of an effort to protect the environment and ensure public health. Mr. Trump has called the move “ridiculous” and promised to revoke the ban.</p><h2 id="link-4504fc54">National Monuments</h2><p>Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/climate/biden-national-monuments-california.html" title="">created two national monuments in California</a> this month that together will prevent mining and drilling — as well as wind, solar and other energy development — across more than 848,000 acres of desert and mountainous land in the state.</p><h2 id="link-1c374">Cuba</h2><p>The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/politics/biden-cuba.html" title="">remove Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism</a> and ease economic penalties on the nation as a part of a deal that was expected to free protesters jailed by the Communist government. Mauricio Claver-Carone, who was recently named as Mr. Trump’s envoy for Latin America, said the announcement favored “authoritarian anti-American regimes.”</p><h2 id="link-3aa0af3">Clemency</h2><p>Mr. Biden last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/us/politics/biden-commutes-37-death-sentences.html" title="">commuted the sentences of nearly all prisoner</a>s on federal death row to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Mr. Trump supports the death penalty, and during his 2024 presidential campaign called for an expansion of it. Mr. Biden also last month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/biden-pardons-commutes-1500.html" title="">commuted the sentences of 1,500 people</a> who were on home confinement, the largest number of commutations by a president in a single day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3537dec8">U.S. Steel</h2><p>The president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-biden.html" title="">blocked the $14 billion takeover</a> of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel of Japan earlier this month on grounds that the sale posed a threat to national security. Mr. Trump has also said U.S. Steel should be American-owned.</p><h2 id="link-31974646">Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>The Biden administration on Monday issued <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/biden-administration-rules-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">sweeping rules</a> earlier this week to govern how artificial intelligence chips and models can be shared with foreign countries.</p><h2 id="link-42f54e3a">Ukraine</h2><p>Mr. Biden in November approved the use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-atacms-missiles.html" title="">U.S.-supplied long-range missiles</a> by Ukraine for strikes inside Russia. Days later, Mr. Biden approved supplying Ukraine with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/world/europe/us-ukraine-anti-personnel-mines.html" title="">American anti-personnel mines</a>. The United States earlier this month announced new sanctions targeting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/us-russia-sanctions.html" title="">Russia’s energy sector</a>. Mr. Biden has also tried to get congressionally approved U.S. aid for Ukraine out of the door. Mr. Trump has been highly skeptical of U.S. aid to Ukraine.</p><h2 id="link-56606365">Student Debt</h2><p>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness.html" title="">said this week</a> that it had canceled student loans for more than 150,000 borrowers, bringing the tally of Americans whose loans were forgiven during Mr. Biden’s term to more than five million.</p><h2 id="link-5c6d93b1">Deportation</h2><p>The administration last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/biden-temporary-protected-status-immigration.html" title="">issued sweeping extensions</a> of deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of people from Sudan, Ukraine, El Salvador and Venezuela in a move that would make it almost impossible for Mr. Trump to swiftly strip the benefit. Mr. Trump has pledged to begin mass deportations on the first day of his administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-2588f46e">Civil Servants</h2><p>The Social Security Administration and the American Federation of Government Employees reached <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-challenges-union-deal-remote-work-policies-federal-workers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an agreement</a> in December that would allow federal employees to continue working remotely until 2029. Mr. Trump has said he will go to court to stop the policy. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers who are focused on cutting the number of federal civil servants have said that requiring employees to come work in offices would result in voluntary departures.</p><p>Mr. Biden separately signed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/us/congress-social-security.html" title="">bipartisan legislation</a> that would give full Social Security benefits to a group of public-sector retirees who currently receive them at a reduced level.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zolan Kanno-Youngs is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zolan-kanno-youngs">More about Zolan Kanno-Youngs</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/2024-election">2024 Elections: News, Polls and Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
