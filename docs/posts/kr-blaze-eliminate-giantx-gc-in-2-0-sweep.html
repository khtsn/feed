</span> 2-0 to eliminate another EMEA team in the Game Changers 2024 Championship. Despite losing to an EMEA team in the upper bracket, KRÜ fought back to win two convincing maps to stay alive in Berlin.</p>

<p>The series started with KRÜ BLAZE picking Bind, with GX picking the defense side first. The first pistol went in favor of GIANTX GC thanks to a great nade from <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/16418/smurfette">
		Smurfette	</a>
</span>. Their unique Bind composition of Harbor, Sage, and Viper introduced two different wall smokes and a potential Sage wall for opponents to break through, but KRÜ fought to get the spike down quickly to secure round wins. The map was even at the half, but KRÜ won their defense side pistol round and <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11235/biazik">
		biazik	</a>
</span> helped secure a bonus round win to extend their lead to 10-6.</p>

<p>KRÜ BLAZE almost ran away with the map, but the utility from GX made their post-plants tough to stop. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/24101/miyori">

</span> clutched a round to complete a mini-comeback, and GX tied the map at 10-10 and 12-12 to take it to overtime.</p>

<p>When overtime began, that was when <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/25663/dods">
		dods	</a>
</span> and her Neon stepped up to quickly end the hopes of a scrappy win for GX, as KRÜ won Bind 14-12 to take the series lead.</p>

<p>Split was next, with GIANTX GC using another unexpected composition change to try and surprise KRÜ, this time with Miyori moving to Raze. KRÜ got the first-half pistol win, but GX took a good eco round and used it to win four rounds in a row. KRÜ bounced back, mainly thanks to an ace from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/11259/conir">
		conir	</a>
</span>.</p>

<p>KRÜ adapted to play a more aggressive defense, entering the half up 7-5 and securing the second-half pistol round to keep the pressure on GX. Just like on Bind, GX started to win rounds to hint at a comeback, but KRÜ stepped up and ended the map 13-9 to eliminate GX from the Game Changers 2024 Championship and keep their run alive.</p>

<p>The MVP of this series was dods, who was the catalyst on Bind&#39;s overtime for their first map win and afterward got 27 kills on Split to close the series out. They led the series with 44 kills, 13 first kills, and 176 damage per round to keep KRÜ in the running for the 2024 title.</p>
