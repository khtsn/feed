declaration sure to jolt the crisis-weary nation, said in an interview that he had no proof that Venezuela’s authoritarian president won last month’s election.</p><p>Since the July 28 vote, governments around the world have expressed skepticism, and even outright disbelief, over President Nicolás Maduro’s claim to victory. But the statement by Juan Carlos Delpino — a member of the government body that announced Mr. Maduro’s win — represents the first major criticism from inside the electoral system.</p><p>Speaking on the record to a reporter for the first time since the vote, Mr. Delpino said he “had not received any evidence” that Mr. Maduro actually won a majority of the vote.</p><p>Neither the electoral body nor Mr. Maduro has released tallies to support assertions that the president won re-election, while the opposition has published receipts from thousands of voting machines that show its candidate, Edmundo González, won an overwhelming majority.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In declaring Mr. Maduro the winner without evidence, the country’s election body “failed the country,” Mr. Delpino said. “I am ashamed, and I ask the Venezuelan people for forgiveness. Because the entire plan that was woven — to hold elections accepted by all — was not achieved.”</p><p>Mr. Delpino, a lawyer and one of two opposition-aligned members of Venezuela’s electoral council, spoke from hiding, afraid of government backlash. In recent weeks Mr. Maduro’s security forces have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/world/americas/venezuela-election-maduro.html" title="">rounded up anyone who appears to doubt his claim</a> to another six years in power, and many Venezuelans are fearful that his forces are crossing borders to go after enemies.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters last month in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, the day after Mr. Maduro claimed to have clinched another term.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alejandro Cegarra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The National Electoral Council, known in Venezuela as the C.N.E., is the five-member body charged with deciding the framework of elections, as well as receiving and announcing results. These duties make it enormously powerful.</p><p>When the country’s legislature selected Mr. Delpino as a member of the council last August, many in Venezuela saw it as an attempt to give it a veneer of balance and legitimacy.</p></div></div><div><div><p>At the time, Mr. Delpino was living in the United States, and he returned to Venezuela to serve on the council out of “great levels of commitment” to the democratic process, he said.</p><p>Most in the country believed that the council was controlled by Mr. Maduro. But Mr. Delpino, a longtime member of an opposition party called Democratic Action, said he agreed to join out of a belief that the “electoral route” was the avenue for change.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the National Electoral Council did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The July vote pitted Mr. Maduro, whose socialist-inspired movement has been in power for 25 years, against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/world/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-elections.html" title="">Edmundo González</a>, a previously little-known diplomat who had the backing of a popular opposition leader, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/world/americas/venezuela-election-opposition-machado.html" title="">María Corina Machado</a>.</p><p>Just hours after polls closed on Election Day, the electoral council president — Elvis Amoroso, a longtime member of Mr. Maduro’s party — proclaimed Mr. Maduro the winner, with just over half of the vote.</p></div></div><div><p>That very evening, Mr. Delpino decided to stop participating in the council, he said, and he did not appear at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o3GH2kmGiw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a news conference</a> announcing Mr. Maduro’s victory.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The likenesses of Hugo Chávez, Simón Bolivar and Mr. Maduro on a mural in Petare, Venezuela.

In recent weeks the opposition has posted those receipts <a href="https://resultadosconvzla.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on its website</a>.</p><p>Mr. Delpino declined to say whether he had<strong> </strong>the voting data received by the government.</p><p>But in a message he said he planned to post on X after his interview with The Times, Mr. Delpino cited a long list of irregularities that led him to “a loss of confidence in the integrity of the process and in the announced results.”</p><p>These irregularities, he wrote, include:</p><ul><li><p>The National Electoral Council’s refusal to release machine-by-machine results.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Claims by election witnesses that they were kicked out of polling stations as the stations closed, making it impossible for them to oversee the final moments of the vote.</p></li><li><p>An interruption in the electronic transmission of results from voting machines to the council’s data hub. (This could create an opening to tamper with the data.)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The “worrying lack” of council meetings in the months before the vote, resulting in Mr. Amoroso making “unilateral” decisions about the process. This made it difficult for Mr. Delpino to push back against policies that tilted the election in Mr. Maduro’s favor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/world/americas/venezuela-election-voters-abroad.html" title="">like barriers to registration abroad</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elvis Amoroso, center, head of the electoral council, last week in Caracas.

Under the president and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, the oil-rich country has experienced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/venezuela-economy.html" title="">an extraordinary economic decline</a>, with mismanagement, corruption and U.S. sanctions eviscerating the economy.</p><p>Mr. Maduro is under investigation by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity and is wanted by the United States on drug trafficking charges.</p><p>Since the vote, some Venezuelans have pressured Mr. Delpino to speak out and criticized him for taking weeks to do so. He said he was coming forward now out of a commitment to transparency.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In the years that Mr. Chávez and then Mr. Maduro consolidated control, some in the opposition have pushed for a military coup or foreign intervention.</p><p>But Mr. Delpino said that despite all he had seen in recent weeks, he thought elections were the answer to better future. “I believe even today that the answer for Venezuela is democratic,” he said.</p><p>“The answer is electoral. With another protagonist in the C.N.E., of course,” — a reference to Mr. Amoroso — “but I believe in that electoral solution.”</p><p>Genevieve Glatsky contributed reporting from Bogotá.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Turkewitz is the Andes Bureau Chief for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia, covering Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-turkewitz">More about Julie Turkewitz</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
