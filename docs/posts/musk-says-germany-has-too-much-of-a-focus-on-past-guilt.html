He has ramped up his support since, while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/europe/germany-elon-musk-afd.html" title="">attempting to portray the party and its leadership</a> as reasonable.</p><p>In doing so, he has brushed aside years of flirtations with Nazism and other actions by AfD members that have led Germany’s mainstream political parties to unite in opposition to working with the organization.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>German intelligence agencies have formally classified parts of the AfD as extremists. A party leader was convicted last year of using banned Nazi language. Members of the party, including a former member of the federal parliament, have been implicated in several plots to overthrow the German government.</p><p>Mr. Musk, though, has praised the AfD repeatedly. He hosted its candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, for a friendly interview this month on X. He addressed a party conference over the weekend by video link, saying the party had the support of the “Trump administration.”</p><p>He went on to invoke Germany’s history dating back to the Roman Empire, citing Julius Caesar’s praise for the Germanic warriors he encountered in battle. He called the AfD’s proposals “common sense” and accused the current German government of oppressing free speech and dissent. He said the world needed less centralized governance, including that from the European Union in Brussels, and stronger governance from individual countries.</p><p>“The fate of the world, I think rests upon this election in Germany,” Mr. Musk said. “It’s extremely fundamental.”</p><p>Despite Mr. Musk’s endorsement, the AfD has not gained much ground in opinion polls ahead of the Feb. 23 parliamentary election. Since Mr. Musk backed the party in a December post, the percentage of voters who say they will vote for the party has only increased by one point, to 21 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, the AfD currently sits in second place, behind the main opposition party, the Christian Democrats, but ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats.</p><p>Late in 2023, before the hard-right party was shook by a number of scandals, including the legal convictions of a regional leader for using banned Nazi phrases, the party was polling at 23 percent.</p><p>All other parties in parliament have vowed not to include the AfD in the formation of a new government after the election.</p><p><a href="https://yougov.de/politics/articles/51443-deutsche-und-briten-weisen-die-jungsten-ausserungen-von-elon-musk-zur-deutschen-und-britischen-politik-zuruck" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Recent polling</a> shows that three-quarters of Germans see Mr. Musk’s attempts to influence German elections as “unacceptable.” The same poll found that 63 percent of respondents thought Mr. Musk did not have a good understanding of German politics.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jim Tankersley is the Berlin bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jim-tankersley">More about Jim Tankersley</a></span></p></div><div><p>Christopher F.
