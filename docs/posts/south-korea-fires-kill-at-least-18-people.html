Their efforts were slowed by winds of 56 miles per hour starting Tuesday afternoon, which prevented them from mobilizing helicopters and drones.</p><p>The first blaze started on Friday afternoon in Sancheong County, around 160 miles southeast of the capital. The Interior Ministry said it was investigating claims that a farmer’s lawn mower had started that one.</p><p>Separate fires broke out in nearby counties and cities in the following days from episodes at a graveyard and at a garbage incinerator. Officials attributed the rapid spread of the fires to dry weather conditions.</p><p>The Justice Ministry said it had transferred around 500 inmates in North Gyeongsang Province overnight on Tuesday, according to Yonhap News.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Firefighters extinguishing a fire in Andong early Wednesday.
