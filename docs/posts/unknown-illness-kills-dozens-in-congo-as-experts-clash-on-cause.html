A second, larger outbreak occurred in Bomate village.</p><p>Preliminary investigations traced the outbreak to three children who in January ate a bat and died. Before death, the children had all bled from their noses and vomited blood.</p><p>Viruses in bats are known to cause a number of diseases in humans and are thought to be natural reservoirs for Marburg and Ebola viruses, two hemorrhagic fevers that are the source of continuing outbreaks in the region.<span>  </span></p><p>Laboratory testing yielded negative results for both Marburg and Ebola, the W.H.O. said, but around half of the samples tested positive for malaria, which is rampant in the region. Samples are also being tested for meningitis. </p><p>On Thursday, Dr. Ngashi Ngongo from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said in a virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q94_f039QKM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news</a> conference that early testing indicated a connection to malaria. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Équateur sickness “is very much similar to what happened in Panzi last year,”<span>  </span>Dr. Ngongo said, referring to a flulike <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON546" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">illness</a> that infected hundreds of people in the southwestern part of the country. The illness was later found to likely be a respiratory infection complicated by <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON547" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malaria</a>.</p><p>Though the W.H.O. said it had been assisting local authorities, aid to the country has likely been diminished by recent U.S. funding cuts. </p><p>Before recent cuts to U.S.A.I.D. by the Trump administration, the United States may have deployed<span>  </span>experts to Congo’s hot zone. Today, there are fewer than 10 people employed at what remains of the agency, to respond to outbreaks around the globe, including those caused by Ebola, mpox and Marburg.</p><p>The outbreak in northwestern Équateur Province is several hundred miles away from an ongoing war and deepening humanitarian crisis in eastern Congo where the Congolese military is battling Rwanda-backed rebels.</p><p>Stephanie Nolen<!-- --> contributed reporting. </p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
