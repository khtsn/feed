It added that Volkswagen managers had told it that a cost-cutting plan announced last year was not working and that additional savings worth “billions” were needed. Volkswagen declined to confirm that number.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Last year, Volkswagen and worker representatives agreed to measures that would save the company 10 billion euros, or $11 billion, by 2026. But those plans, which included job cuts largely based on attrition, are no longer enough, the company said on Monday.</p><p>“The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation,” Oliver Blume, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement. “Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness. In this environment, we as a company must now act decisively.”</p><p>The automaker owns 10 brands, including Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, but its flagship brand remains core to its identity and that of Germany’s storied history as an automobile nation. But Volkswagen has faced falling sales, amid decreased demand in Europe, especially for its electric vehicles.</p><p>Volkswagen’s share of the Chinese market, its largest market, has shrunk as fast-moving domestic rivals roll out affordable electric cars. Despite plans by the European Union to introduce tariffs on imports of electric cars from China, those competitors are starting to expand into Europe.</p><p>The German economy, Europe’s largest, contracted in the months from April to June, shrinking 0.1 percent from a year earlier. The latest figures dampened hopes that the country might be pulling out of stagnation, which analysts say is driven by high energy and labor costs.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Shutdowns of Volkswagen’s German factories would be a first for the company, which was founded in Wolfsburg in 1937. But closing plants, as well as ending the agreement that provides workers with job guarantees through 2029, will face stiff opposition from union leaders and workers’ representatives, who hold half the seats on the company’s supervisory board.</p><p>Daniela Cavallo, a union leader and the head of the council representing Volkswagen workers, blamed company management for failing to develop a competent strategy and instead seeking to save by cutting jobs.</p><p>“We will fiercely defend ourselves against this,” Ms. Cavallo said in a statement. “There will be no plant closures with us.”</p><p>Clashes with unions have cost several chief executives at Volkswagen their jobs. Already the unions are gearing up for wage negotiations that are set to begin this fall. Nearly half of Volkswagen’s 650,000 workers around the globe are in Germany.</p><p>“The company — and the VW brand — are in a very dangerous situation,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Melissa Eddy is based in Berlin and reports on Germany’s politics, businesses and its economy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/melissa-eddy">More about Melissa Eddy</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>From Russia’s Zuckerberg to Wanted Man: </strong>Pavel Durov’s anti-establishment streak helped him create Telegram, one of the world’s biggest online platforms. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/technology/pavel-durov-telegram-founder.html">It also put a target on his back</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Party of Workers?: </strong>Populist lawmakers are part of a new generation of Republicans learning to love labor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/business/economy/labor-workers-republicans-trump-vance.html">It’s not clear if labor will love them back</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Twitter Blue’s Chaotic Revamp: </strong>The overhaul of the subscription service that lets users buy verified badges was the first big test for Elon Musk as the platform’s new owner. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/technology/elon-musk-twitter-blue.html">It didn’t go well</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why Japan Loves 7-Eleven: </strong>The convenience store chain is a national treasure in the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/business/7-eleven-japan-couche-tard.html">making a foreign buyout bid a hard sell</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Going Into Debt for Disney: </strong>Some families are spending <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/business/disney-vacation-debt.html">more than they can afford on Disney vacations</a>.
