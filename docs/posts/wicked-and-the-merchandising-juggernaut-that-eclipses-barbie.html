    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><header><p>Critic’s Notebook</p><p id="article-summary">The new movie’s tie-ins are the logical endpoint for a Broadway show that always intended to be huge.</p><p><time datetime="2024-11-26T05:01:13-05:00"><span>Nov. 26, 2024</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="GridBlock-0"><div><figcaption><span> The “Wicked” product line ranges from Mattel versions of Glinda and Elphaba, far left, to tumblers and Crocs, all sticking to the green-and-pink color scheme of the show and film.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Mattel; Stanley; Crocs</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>It started with the dolls.</p><p>As a longtime fan of “Wicked” who grew up collecting Barbies, I was immediately intrigued by the Mattel creations resembling Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo in the movie version of the Broadway musical. They were perfectly rendered in likeness and even sang snippets of “Popular” and “Defying Gravity.” I’ll admit, I coveted them.</p><p>But that was just the beginning of the “Wicked” merchandise. Soon my Instagram and X feeds were inundated with pink and green collaborations. Some made sense in the context of both the movie and the stars. Why, of course Grande’s R.E.M. Beauty brand would feature a line of “Wicked”-inspired goods. She might as well promote both her performance and her entrepreneurial venture at the same time.</p><p>Other “Wicked” products ranged from the functional to the positively ridiculous, but they all contributed to the sense that “Wicked” was absolutely everywhere, making it perhaps one of the most marketed movies in recent memory, surpassing even the hot pink inundation of “Barbie” last year.</p><p>I discovered many of these via the X account <a href="https://x.com/wickednewshub?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wicked News Hub</a>, which posts every tiny update about the film and its promotional path. It is run by a lawyer in Manchester, England, who started it out of a love of all things Grande. (He asked to keep the identity behind the account private.) “Although I expected a lot of collaborations, from tracking ‘Wicked’ news over the years, even I was surprised by the incredible amount of collaborations and goodies,” he wrote in an email.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>There are “Wicked” versions of the TikTok-popular Stanley Cups, which according to some reports caused <a href="https://www.today.com/food/news/wicked-stanley-cups-target-rcna176099" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pandemonium when they were released in Target</a>. They seem like your standard drinking vessel, but the film promotion capitalized on the fervor. There are “Wicked”-themed Crocs. (The Glinda ones have heels.) There are “Wicked” clothing lines for the <a href="https://www.gap.com/browse/new/wicked-collection?cid=3038910" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gap</a>, <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_us/women/campaigns/1050-wicked-x-hm.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H&amp;M</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/fashion-lookbooks-videos-style-guide/wicked?id=1248706&amp;cm_mmc=google-_-Dynamic+Search+Ads+-+Main+-+Search+Partners-_-Catch+All+-+Main-_-s___678069626859-_-go_cmp-382434664_adg-31716050344_ad-678069626859_dsa-332841324604_dev-c_ext-_sig-Cj0KCQiA88a5BhDPARIsAFj595iFUs6SmN92YFn-Qlwt8mb7Qbs2xffmhokRbgFiSAfALv-d444cAEsaArqnEALw_wcB&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA88a5BhDPARIsAFj595iFUs6SmN92YFn-Qlwt8mb7Qbs2xffmhokRbgFiSAfALv-d444cAEsaArqnEALw_wcB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomingdale’s</a> and <a href="https://www.forever21.com/us/2001321768.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Forever 21</a>. You can buy “Wicked” Legos and “Wicked” Monopoly. There are even “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/conair/WickedbyConair/page/D4A44FFB-579D-41D7-99AE-2457850E5241" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wicked” hair dryers</a>. (The Mattel dolls <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/movies/mattel-wicked-porn-site-mistake.html" title="">weathered</a> a minor controversy when the packaging accidentally bore the URL for a porn site, not the movie.)</p><p>Starbucks has an enormous “Wicked” line that includes bedazzled tumblers and two themed drinks: Glinda’s Pink Potion and Elphaba’s Cold Brew. While getting a boring plain latte, I sampled the Elphaba, assuming the Glinda would hurt my teeth. It was minty.</p><p>Then came the “Wicked” instant macaroni and cheese from <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/GREAT-VALUE-2-05-OZ-PURPLE-AND-GREEN-MACARONI-AND-CHEESE-CUP/7972820662?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=3795&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;adid=222222222777972820662_161193766053_21214199653&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=697173827980&amp;wl4=pla-2348450966064&amp;wl5=9073479&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=7972820662&amp;veh=sem_LIA&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw7Py4BhCbARIsAMMx-_JbXqkjbdHk__GTgFL8CdbBRYTXEfHXuhcjaOGrCzMgIUtnWGm35wkaAhe1EALw_wcB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Walmart’s Great Value label</a>. The little containers are labeled “mystery color” so you don’t know whether your mac will turn out a murky green or a Pepto Bismol pink.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-4"><div><figcaption><span>Although there&#39;s no overt product placement in the film, you could shop your way to the aesthetics on display in Elphaba and Glinda&#39;s dorm room. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Beis; Starbucks; Stanley; Crocs</span></span></figcaption></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The mystery macaroni is perhaps the moment “Wicked” marketing moved into absurdist territory. But why has it been so aggressive — even more so than the pushes for “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,” currently the highest grossing films of the year?</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In part, you can attribute this to Universal’s intense efforts to make “Wicked” a global phenomenon. “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,” both from Disney, are sequels that are part of recognizable brands. The “Wicked” goods sell not just a movie, but a lifestyle, too. Marvel and Pixar are already accepted as such. “Wicked” is a newcomer, at least in the cinematic sphere.</p><p>Of course, the stage version of “Wicked” does have name value, having toured the world since debuting on Broadway in 2003. Its roots as an origin story for the beloved 1939 MGM classic “The Wizard of Oz,” starring Judy Garland, shouldn’t be overlooked either. Oz iconography is already highly marketable. There’s a <a href="https://www.marcjacobs.com/us-en/the-marc-jacobs/featured/marc-jacobs-x-wizard-of-oz/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoae5BhCNARIsADVLzZdQn3_dtVQO1MhkMoO0ZVPkY0sOGs6fAbRbG4gA31-_vtxOdbUapIoaAnG8EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marc Jacobs “Wizard of Oz”</a> collection currently on sale that has nothing to do with “Wicked” but surely will benefit from Oz fever.</p><p>Universal’s president of franchise management and brand strategy, David O’Connor, told me in a video call that the studio held a “fair” to which it invited potential brand partners to build interest in the film. But O’Connor, who saw the musical several times over the years, knew there was a “multigenerational” appeal to the story.</p><p>“There is this incredible fan base, and there was this incredible opportunity to really extend the film and allow consumers to engage with the brand in a variety of ways, from little girls playing with dolls to boys and girls playing with Lego play sets to teens, tweens and Gen Z going to Starbucks to the adults with our Lexus partnership,” he said.</p><p>While there is no overt product placement in Jon M. Chu’s film adaptation, you can see how its aesthetics lend itself to all the merchandise it has inspired. One of the most crucial sequences involves the makeover that Glinda tries to give Elphaba as she sings “Popular” in their Shiz University dorm room, which she has spruced up with pink accouterments. Want to do something similar? Well, you too can have pink “<a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-wicked-weekender-in-wicked-pink?variant=42958936899720&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=21262872184&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;gadid=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA0MG5BhD1ARIsAEcZtwQ5gxal6pmrPBEME-iEA5qeZdb-eHHgnd3bWOJ0qRLjaq4HOT88iBEaAviTEALw_wcB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wicked” luggage</a> like Glinda, and light a <a href="https://voluspa.com/products/pink-goes-good-with-green-candle-duo-set?variant=42688254541917&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=pmax-brand&amp;utm_content=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA0MG5BhD1ARIsAEcZtwQ1MLgB3005lbHxQfBAdZZsnaHsq79ciB3UTHYs-pIbAqdm4r-Y_nEaAqnlEALw_wcB" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pink “Wicked” candle</a> for ambience.

I first saw the Broadway production as a 13-year-old and immediately became obsessed. It appealed to every part of my tweenage-girl brain. In Elphaba, the green outcast with big dreams, I saw the lonely side of myself, trying desperately to fit in. But the inherent humor in Glinda, the queen bee who claims she can make anyone popular, was instantly appealing, too. She had the best punchlines and the prettiest dresses.</p><p>If I could have lived my middle school life in “Wicked” clothes, wearing “Wicked” makeup, even eating “Wicked” food, I probably would have.</p><p>So this merchandising influx feels almost like the natural endgame for this Broadway property. Onstage, “Wicked” developed its own eye-catching version of Oz that was instantly recognizable, and while the movie expands on that, it is all a riff on the foundation the show established. “Wicked” was designed to be a juggernaut, but Broadway can reach only so many people. Now that it’s a movie, its reach has expanded to the point where it’s unavoidable.</p><p>Perhaps that’s overwhelming, but, you know what? I now own two of the Mattel dolls. My mother recently sent them because she remembered the little girl belting out the songs in the car.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
