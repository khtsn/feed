Among the states joining the suit are New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.</p><p>“My office will be taking imminent legal action against this administration’s unconstitutional pause on federal funding,” the New York attorney general, Letitia James,<span>  </span>wrote on <a href="https://x.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1884271636230332562" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media</a> on Tuesday. “We won’t sit idly by while this administration harms our families.”</p><p>The freeze order, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/27/us/omb-memo.html" title="">two-page memo</a> from Matthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, directs federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all federal financial assistance,” specifically citing “D.E.I., woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal.” The meaning of the directive was unclear and has plunged state agencies, city governments and nonprofit organizations into confusion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The lawsuit opens up another front in what will be a long legal fight led by Democrat-led states and progressive activists to stop President Trump’s aggressive second-term agenda in the federal courts.

Nixon has required the executive branch to spend money allocated by Congress and signed by the president. Democrats contend that money approved by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. through the infrastructure law, routine congressional appropriations and other measures cannot be summarily blocked without an act of Congress. To do so, they say would be an unconstitutional usurpation of the legislative branch’s power of the purse</p><p>The budget office’s memo said that “assistance received directly by individuals,” as well as Medicare and Social Security benefits, would not be impacted by the pause. But it remains unclear whether that carve-out would include Medicaid, a federally-funded program where the money flows first to states and then care is provided to low-income residents.</p><p>For example, New York State is expected to receive about $90 billion in federal funding this year, according to the state’s budget office. Of that about $60 billion would be directed to Medicaid, which provides care to about seven million New Yorkers. The State Budget Office also expects to receive about $4.7 billion in education funding and nearly $3 billion for transportation infrastructure investments. All of that money could now be vulnerable.</p><p>“In the event of a substantial hit to Medicaid funding, millions of people including many who voted for President Trump would lose health insurance,” said Nathan Gusdorf, the director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization in New York.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On Tuesday morning, state officials and organizations that receive federal funding were grappling with the scale and consequences of this memo. Many had learned about the freeze the night before, when the memo was posted on social media.</p><p>“This order is a potential five-alarm fire for nonprofit organizations and the people and communities they serve,” Diane Yentel, the chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits, said in a statement.</p><p>Chris Cameron<!-- --> contributed to this report.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The First 100 Days of the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Military Changes:</strong> President Trump moved toward pushing openly transgender people out of the military and directed the Pentagon to end diversity programs as he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-military-transgender-dei-orders.html">sought to reshape America’s armed forces</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Firing Prosecutors:</strong> The acting attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/justice-department-firings-trump-jack-smith.html">fired more than a dozen prosecutors</a> who worked on the investigations into Trump for the special counsel Jack Smith, saying they could not be trusted to “faithfully implement” the president’s agenda.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigration:</strong> When Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, refused military planes carrying deportees, infuriating Trump, he revealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/americas/colombia-trump-deportation-flights-migrants.html">how heated the question of deportations has become</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health:</strong> Conservative Christian moms believe in home-schooling and distrust food and drug companies.
