We don’t do that here. If you ask me, the president should be forced to fly the same way the rest of us do. He should have to sit at Newark for six hours nursing a $30 Bloody Mary, and chewing on a pretzel while he waits for the one on-duty air traffic controller’s hands to stop shaking.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p><p>“Trump should have a big plane because Trump definitely does not have a little plane.

Look where we are on the tarmac next to each other. I know you’re not supposed to just look straight ahead, but I took a little peek over there, a little peek over there. Cockpit was huge, man!” <em>— JORDAN KLEPPER</em></p><p>“I’m sorry, why does the president need any of this? Air Force One is supposed to be technologically advanced, not luxurious. It’s designed so the president can get national security briefings anywhere in the world, not so he can chill on leather couches and use nine different bathrooms — which, by the way, he might need to do on the way home based on the fact that the Saudis set up a custom-built mobile McDonald’s in anticipation of Trump’s visit.” <em>— SETH MEYERS</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-482ec157">The Punchiest Punchlines (Humps for Trump Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“When Trump landed in Qatar, he was escorted by a fleet of Cybertrucks, Arabian horses and camels. And even the horses and camels were laughing at the Cybertruck.” <em>— JIMMY FALLO</em>N</p><p>“Yeah, Trump was welcomed by horses and camels.
