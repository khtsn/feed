She has not.</p><p>Instead, the former lawmaker is working around the clock, taking virtual meetings with foreign ministers and human rights organizations, urging them to remember that a broad coalition of nations acknowledge that her chosen candidate, Edmundo González, won the July vote by a wide margin and should be taking office in January.</p><p>Just hours after the election, Mr. Maduro declared victory, but he released no evidence to back up his claim. In response, the Machado team <a href="https://resultadosconvzla.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collected and published</a> vote-tally receipts from more than 80 percent of polling stations.</p><p>The tallies, they said, showed that Mr. González had garnered almost 70 percent of the vote. (Fearing for his freedom, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-argentina-embassy.html" title="">Mr. González, 75, fled to Spain</a> in September.)</p><p>Ms. Machado argued that Venezuela now offers something extremely tempting to President-elect Donald J. Trump: “an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>In her view, Mr. Maduro is now so weak — rejected by his own people, suffering fractures within his party — that a renewed pressure campaign by Mr. Trump and his allies could in fact push the Venezuelan autocrat to negotiate his own exit.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Opposition supporters hold vote tallies following July’s election. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alejandro Cegarra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>This pressure campaign, she said, could include reversing the sanctions relief put in place by Mr. Biden and the pursuit of new criminal charges against Mr. Maduro’s allies. </p><p>She praised Mr. Trump’s selection of Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/marco-rubio-trump-secretary-of-state.html" title="">Marco Rubio of Florida for secretary of state</a>, and Representative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-michael-waltz-national-security-adviser.html" title="">Mike Waltz of Florida for national security adviser</a>, positions that will be key in defining U.S. policy toward Venezuela.</p><p>Mr. Rubio, whom Ms. Machado has known for more than a decade, has staked his political career in part on a no-compromises approach to leftist authoritarians in Latin America.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/marco-rubio-venezuela.html" title="">was an architect</a> of Mr. Trump’s previous policy toward Venezuela, a so-called maximum pressure campaign that involved broad sanctions on the country’s vital oil industry and support for a young legislator, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/juan-guaido" title="">Juan Guaidó</a>, who claimed to be the country’s interim president.</p><p>The approach failed to oust Mr. Maduro, who labeled Mr. Guaidó a U.S. puppet, and some analysts argue that it even strengthened the autocrat, showing that he could withstand an all-out offensive from the world’s most powerful nation.</p><p>But Ms. Machado believes this moment is different. Mr. Maduro is financially broken, she said, has <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-10-25/brazil-blocked-venezuelas-entry-into-brics-due-to-post-election-betrayal.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alienated key allies</a> like President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, and has lost so much public support that he has been forced to launch his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/world/americas/venezuela-election-maduro.html" title="">most brutal repression campaign yet</a> to stay in power.</p><p>Perhaps even more relevant, the Venezuelan people, she said, were now largely united behind a democratically elected president, Mr. González.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Machado clasps hands with Edmundo  González, the opposition candidate who many countries have recognized as the legitimate winner of July’s election.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Loureiro Fernandez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Ms. Machado has yet to speak to either Mr. Rubio or Mr. Waltz after their nominations, but said that their teams and hers were in “permanent contact.”</p><p>While many analysts say the recent election laid bare Mr. Maduro’s weaknesses, few believe the autocrat, who is being investigated for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court and could face arrest if ousted, has much incentive to leave.</p><p>“She says, ‘Maduro has no choice, he has to negotiate,’” said Phil Gunson, an analyst with International Crisis Group who has been based in Venezuela for more than two decades. “I think he does have a choice, and his choice is to remain in power.”</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Maduro characterized the U.S. president as imperialist enemy No. 1. But in the days since Mr. Trump won a second term, Mr. Maduro has tried to curry favor, publicly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpJvGIJcS4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressing hope that the two could work together</a>.</p><p>Mr. Maduro clearly needs the United States to lift sanctions, while Mr. Trump, who has vowed to undertake mass deportations, could use the Venezuelan leader’s help in making good on his promise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Speaking recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpJvGIJcS4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on one of his talk shows</a>, Mr. Maduro called for a new moment of “win-win” relations.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Billboards in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, portraying Nicolás Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, with the message “It is time for loyalty,” in Caracas in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Loureiro Fernandez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It is unclear if the Maduro government knows Ms. Machado’s location.</p><p>“It’s difficult to believe they don’t know,” said Laura Dib, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America.</p><p>“My read is that they know the political cost of imprisoning her,” Ms. Dib went on, “and instead they are betting on wearing her down.”</p><p>Many opposition leaders have come and gone in Venezuela over the years; few have built as broad a coalition as Ms. Machado. The eldest daughter in a prominent steel business family, she has spent roughly two decades trying to remove Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, from power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>In 2002 she founded a voter rights organization, Súmate, which pushed unsuccessfully to oust Mr. Chávez through a recall vote.

When Mr. Maduro’s government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-opposition.html" title="">barred her from running in the general election</a>, she managed to get <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/world/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-venezuela-elections.html" title="">Mr. González</a> on the ballot in her stead.</p><p>On the campaign trail, she was received almost as a religious figure, often wearing white, promising to restore democracy and reunite families torn apart by an economic crisis and mass migration.</p><p>“María!” her followers shouted, before falling into her arms.</p><p>In hiding these days, she wakes up alone, cooks and ponders the future of the country alone. Her three adult children live abroad; it is unclear when she will see them again. When she appears in videos shared online, she uses a blank white background, an effort, perhaps futile, to conceal her location.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ms. Machado declined to say whether she even could go outside. “It’s a difficult test,” she said of isolation.</p><p>Mr. González, now in Spain, has focused on pushing their cause in meetings with European leaders.</p><p>In the interviews, Ms. Machado’s voice often quickened to a near-panic pace, and she expressed frustration that some nations were not doing more to isolate Mr. Maduro.</p><p>“We Venezuelans did everything the international community asked of us,” she said, a reference to the millions of people who risked retaliation to vote for her movement. “Now it’s time for the international community to do its part.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The vandalized headquarters in Caracas of Ms. Machado’s political party.

Among them are some of Ms. Machado’s closest advisers. At least two people have died after being taken into custody and another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/world/americas/venezuela-protester-deaths-democracy.html" title="">two dozen people were killed amid protests</a> just after the July vote.

Mr. Maduro is a major ally of Russia, Iran and China.</p><p>Asked how long she can remain in hiding, Ms. Machado said that she was “working to make it as short as possible,” and hoped that all Venezuelans would soon be “reunited in freedom.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><p>“But I am willing to do what has to be done,” she said, “for as long as it takes to assert the truth and popular sovereignty.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Machado believes that Mr. Maduro is in a weakened position, though some analysts say he is not ready to cede power. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Adriana Loureiro Fernandez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><p>Isayen Herrera contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Turkewitz is the Andes Bureau Chief for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia, covering Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/hugo-chavez">Hugo Chávez</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/maria-corina-machado">Maria Corina Machado</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/11/18/world/americas/venezuela-trump-maria-machado-democracy.html">69</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Is a ‘Green’ Revolution Poisoning India’s Capital?: </strong>India promised to burn its trash mountains and safely turn them into electricity.
