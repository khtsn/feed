Zlatko Vujovic, the head of the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, characterized the election as “not good.”</p><p>“They were not conducted in the proper way as should be expected from a country that has a E.U. candidate status,” Mr. Vujovic said at a briefing with journalists.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Critical violations included violence against opposition members, voter intimidation, smear campaigns targeting observers, and extensive misuse of administrative resources, he said.</p><p>The Election Administration of Georgia, the body that oversees elections in the country, <a href="https://results.cec.gov.ge/#/en-us/election_57/tr/dashboard" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> on Sunday that the ruling party garnered more than 54 percent of the vote with the four main opposition groups receiving 37.5 percent. That means that Georgian Dream will have 89 seats in Parliament with the remaining 61 occupied by the opposition.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Voting on Saturday in Tbilisi in parliamentary elections</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Diego Fedele/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But all four opposition groups said they did not recognize the election as legitimate, citing significant violations. At least two said they will not enter Parliament, setting the stage for a prolonged political crisis. They did not provide evidence for their allegations.</p><p>“Bidzina has conducted a K.G.B.-style special operation,” said Mamukha Khazaradze, leader of Strong Georgia, one of the opposition groups, in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mamukakhazaradzeofficial/posts/pfbid02UgcsiiD7d6oU8CL9RLgUpniNNPkNkjZgyQTBHU8u1L6mgZhvtyUakqByD8npDA9jl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a post</a> on Facebook, referring to Bidzina Ivanishvili, the informal leader of Georgian Dream. “The elections were totally rigged, the people’s vote was stolen and the country is being prepared for Russia.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Elene Khostaria, another opposition leader, said during a briefing with journalists that she believed that Russia had interfered with the election process, noting the high stakes involved.</p><p>“It was a referendum with geopolitical implications,” she said. “It was Russia or the West.”</p><p>The previous parliamentary elections ended with a similar scenario, with the opposition refusing to accept the official results. The crisis lasted more than five months before the ruling party and the opposition reached an agreement that was mediated by officials from the European Union.</p><p>But this time, the ruling party seemed determined to press ahead with what it said was a mandate from the people, and it is unlikely to welcome European mediation.</p><p>Speaking at a briefing on Sunday, Georgia’s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, said that the election was administered “flawlessly.”</p><p>“Our victory is impressive and clear — any attempt to talk about manipulations in the context of electronic vote and unprecedented campaign circumstances is bound to fail,” said Mr. Kobakhidze, adding that the new parliament will operate regardless of whether opposition lawmakers enter it or not.</p><p>Leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Georgia’s neighbors in the South Caucasus, congratulated Georgian Dream. Russian lawmakers and officials also commended the result.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ivan Nechepurenko covers Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia.
