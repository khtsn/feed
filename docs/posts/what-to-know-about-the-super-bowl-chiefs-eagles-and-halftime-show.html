Just between you and me?</h2><p>Yeah, shoot.</p><h2 id="link-211af049">I … don’t really understand this Super Bowl thing.</h2><p>You don’t understand <em>the Super Bowl</em>? The ubiquitous event that dwarfs every other American entertainment option? The seasonal culmination of a sport woven deep within the rich tapestry of a mighty country?</p><h2 id="link-484b753">Shhh! I don’t want everyone to know!</h2><p>Maybe you’re not from the United States. Or were the kind of child who watched “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Or maybe you just prefer pickleball. We’ve got you covered. You’ve come to the right place to find out all about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/super-bowl" title="">this year’s Super Bowl</a> with no tears or embarrassment.</p><h2 id="link-7ed2da45">Great! When is the game, and who’s playing?</h2><p>The Super Bowl is the final game of the season of the National Football League, the mammoth league with the $100 billion television contract and teams worth $5 billion or more. This year, the Philadelphia Eagles will face the Kansas City Chiefs in New Orleans on Sunday starting at 6:30 p.m. Eastern on Fox, although pregame coverage starts at 1 p.m.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-7decba26">Uh, Chiefs? That wouldn’t be a reference to …</h2><p>Yes, Native Americans, and that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/sports/football/chiefs-tomahawk-chop-protest.html" title="">makes some people</a> pretty uncomfortable. The team in Washington changed its name in 2020 from a slur against Native Americans. Kansas City’s name, for now, will not change.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kansas City Chiefs fans will be watching their team in a third consecutive Super Bowl.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jason Hanna/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-437eb8e4">Give me some memorable Super Bowl moments.</h2><p>There are so many to choose from. In <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/12/30/77185656.html?pageNumber=40" title="">Super Bowl III</a> in 1969, Joe Namath predicted his New York Jets would beat the heavily favored Baltimore Colts, and then backed up his boast with a victory.</p><p>To promote their appearance in Super Bowl XX in 1986, members of the Chicago Bears made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooT_uz--O2A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cringey pop video</a>, “The Super Bowl Shuffle,” and then won anyway, by a record margin. The New York Giants upset the undefeated New England Patriots when a player caught the ball by trapping it on his helmet (XLII, 2008).</p><p>The game has never been canceled, but it has been halted for half an hour by a blackout (XLVII, 2013).</p><p>Last season (LVIII), Kansas City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/49ers-vs-chiefs-super-bowl-live-score-updates-game-summary/s1iecqQvbh5m/" title="">won in overtime, 25-22</a>. It was the first Super Bowl in which the lead changed hands on the last play.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-6b2aacda">I hear the halftime shows have gotten more elaborate.</h2><p>There have been many memorable Super Bowl halftime shows, including one with a “wardrobe malfunction” (Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson, XXXVIII, 2004) that was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/NYT-Presents/100000008318220/the-new-york-times-presents-malfunction-the-dressing-down-of-janet-jackson.html" title="">subject of a New York Times documentary</a>.</p><p>In the first Super Bowl <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/arts/music/its-been-a-long-time-since-those-sousaphones.html" title="">halftime show in 1967</a>, Al Hirt, the trumpeter and band leader, performed to a live audience of some 67,000 fans.</p><p>The producers of the N.F.L.’s biggest event of the year have gradually raised the ante of the show’s musical acts, from university marching bands decades ago to the world’s biggest pop stars, including Madonna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Beyoncé. Last year’s performer was Usher; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show.html" title="">Kendrick Lamar</a> takes the stage this year.</p><h2 id="link-45692fe5">Who still uses Roman numerals?</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/01/sports/football/all-the-numerals-fit-to-print-at-least-until-its-2054.html" title="">The N.F.L. does</a>, except in 2016 when they called it Super Bowl 50 because Super Bowl L looked a little silly.

He takes the oblong ball at the start of each play, and he either hands it to a player who tries to run with it or he throws it downfield for a receiver to catch. Teams have four tries, or “downs,” to advance the ball at least 10 yards (9.1 meters, but don’t get caught saying that when surrounded by football fans).</p><p>The other team will try to stop them from doing so, a process that often ends with one or more players grabbing the player with the ball and hurling him to the ground abruptly.</p><p>Sometimes a player will do something wrong (a “penalty”) and the referee will signal this by throwing what looks like a yellow hankie (the announcers will say that “a flag is on the field”).</p><p>The field is 100 yards long, and a team making it to the end (the “end zone”) gets 6 points (a “touchdown,” very good), and 1 more if it can kick a ball through some big metal posts (the “goal posts”) afterward. There are other ways to score, but we promised to keep it simple.</p><p>Sorry, soccer fans, the game cannot end in a tie. If it does, the teams play “overtime” until a winner is determined.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-6ab976e5">Wait, why is this sport called football? The feet seem secondary. And is an oblong spheroid really a ‘ball?’</h2><p>Amazingly, you are not the first person to make these observations. A hoary joke says that the game should really be called “hand egg.”</p><p>American football evolved from “rugby football” in the late 19th century. The transition came in 1906, when teams began passing the ball forward instead of only backward. The N.F.L. was founded in the 1920s and started the Super Bowl championship game in 1967 after a merger with a smaller upstart, the American Football League.</p><p>There are several variations of football around the globe. What Americans call soccer is football or fútbol in much of the rest of the world. Canadian football is similar to the American game, but teams can charmingly score a “rouge,” worth 1 point. Australia’s football involves men with very little padding passing the ball by hitting it with their fists.</p><h2 id="link-168aa44d">Who are some players to look for on Sunday?</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs, left, and Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The quarterback for Kansas City is Patrick Mahomes, and Philadelphia’s is Jalen Hurts.

Kansas City’s Travis Kelce, perhaps the best player ever at his position, tight end, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/style/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-tweets.html" title="">raised his profile even more</a> with his relationship with music’s global superstar, Taylor Swift. She often attends his games, causing some purists to grumble that shots of her in the luxury boxes are overshadowing the game, although a close look last season revealed her total screen time is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/style/taylor-swift-nfl-broadcasts.html" title="">actually fairly limited</a>.</p><h2 id="link-3af8f68f">I hear there’s a record on the line.</h2><p>Should Kansas City win, it would become the first team ever to win three consecutive Super Bowls.</p><p>One caveat though: There were N.F.L. champions long before the name “Super Bowl” was coined. And the Green Bay Packers won three N.F.L. titles in a row in 1929-31 and 1965-67, with the last two of those being the first two Super Bowls.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-69bf38fe">Give me a slightly sophisticated ‘take’ to say during the action.</h2><p>When it is fourth down, yell for the team with the ball to try a play (“go for it”), rather than kick the ball away or try for a field goal. Fans have always loved this aggressive strategy, and the game is catching up. While coaches used to routinely kick even when they were inches away from a first down, they now are much more inclined to try for the yards.</p><p>When in doubt, say “the game is won in the trenches.” Or “edge rusher” or “Tampa 2” or “Jet sweep.” Your football-loving friends will nod sagely.</p><h2 id="link-6f41c18e">Can I bet on this?</h2><p>No one knows exactly how much money is bet on the Super Bowl, but it’s a lot — more than $10 billion, according to estimates, much of it illegally. The most common way to bet is through the point spread (Kansas City is a 1 1/2-point favorite, meaning they must win by at least 2 points for bettors backing them to cash in).</p><p>But you can also bet on almost anything related to the game: how many yards a particular player will gain, who will win the coin toss that starts the game or which song Kendrick Lamar will sing first in the halftime show.</p><h2 id="link-2d5fb6ca">The game lasts for hours. I think I’ll take a break during the commercials.</h2><p>Don’t do it. Advertisers spend a fortune to get a slot during the Super Bowl, and then another fortune to create new, funny and memorable ads for the occasion. Especially if the game is a blowout, the ads may be the next day’s major talking point.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kendrick Lamar, who will be performing during the halftime show on Sunday, recently won record of the year at the Grammy Awards.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Chris Pizzello/Invision, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h2 id="link-517c2da2">I’ve heard the sport has a dark side.</h2><p>Sadly, yes.

Worse, players who take repeated hits to the head risk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/head-injuries-in-football" title="">developing C.T.E.</a>, a degenerative brain disease.</p><p>Players who receive blows to the head now must leave the field and be examined for a concussion.</p><p>More and more fans are tempering their enjoyment of the sport with the sobering knowledge that the players entertaining us on the field are doing so at grave risk.</p><h2 id="link-4adea5f7">Now all I need is one funny thing to tell people at the Super Bowl party I’ve just spontaneously decided to host.</h2><p>Around the time of the game, internet searches for “Super Bowl” go way up.
