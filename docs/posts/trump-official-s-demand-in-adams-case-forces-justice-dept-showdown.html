Sassoon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/danielle-sassoon-quit-eric-adams.html" title="">resigned rather than sign off</a> on Mr. Bove’s command to dismiss the corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York. Ms. Sassoon is no member of the liberal resistance: She clerked for the conservative Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, and had been appointed to her post by Mr. Trump’s team.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dropping the charges, “for reasons having nothing to do with the strength of the case,” went against the “duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/13/us/doc-annotation-letter-to-bondi.html" title="">wrote in a letter to Mr. Bove</a> explaining her decision.</p><p>Mr. Bove, rebuffed by Ms. Sassoon, tried a procedural end-around, asking officials in the department’s Washington headquarters to take over the case, then have someone on their staff sign the dismissal.</p><p>Instead, five prosecutors in the criminal division and public integrity unit also quit, leaving their colleagues to furtively discuss their options, expressing their hope that they would not be called upon to take actions that would end with their resignation or termination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-3"><div data-testid="interactive-block"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/14/us/doj-resignations-trump-adams.html"><p><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/14/multimedia/2025-02-14-doj-resignations-index/2025-02-14-doj-resignations-index-articleLarge-v2.jpg"/></p><div><h2>Diagram: How the Justice Department Resignations Unfolded</h2><p>More than half a dozen government attorneys have resigned since an order by the Trump administration’s Justice Department to drop charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York City.</p></div></a></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As of late Thursday, no department official had formally filed the dismissal motion in federal court.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The consequences of the confrontation extend far beyond the fate of Mr. Adams. It has set up what promises to be a protracted and damaging battle over the integrity, independence and direction of a department that Mr. Trump views like a piece of captured battlefield artillery he is now able to turn against his attackers.</p><p>Mr. Bove is, in the view of his critics, imposing what amounts to a political loyalty test on prosecutors — demanding they comply with his requests, however unacceptable and incompatible with norms, or get out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Danielle R.

It has left many employees angry and worried for the department’s future.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The Adams case brought those concerns to a head.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mayor Eric Adams speaking in Manhattan on Thursday.

During the Watergate era, senior political appointees resigned rather than carry out what they viewed as an unlawful order to fire the prosecutor investigating President Nixon — an event referred to as the Saturday Night Massacre.</p><p>Thursday’s crisis was different, according to Justice Department veterans, in that the political leadership seemed resolved to assert total control over the career prosecutors that many staff members see as the backbone of the agency.</p><p>There is growing fear at department headquarters that its politically appointed leaders are determined to remove an entire layer of highly qualified and experienced senior career officials, and in doing so, end the traditional independence of investigating and charging corruption cases. The administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-orders-bribery-corruption.html" title="">has already moved on a number of fronts</a> to scale back anti-corruption work.</p><p>In response, current and former Justice Department officials said, defense lawyers on a wide variety of cases are drafting direct appeals to Mr. Bove to try to nullify pending charges or investigations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>In her letter of refusal to Mr. Bove, Ms. Sassoon suggested that should he find a career employee to sign off on his request, the judge overseeing the case was likely to ask tough questions of department officials.</p><p>To an agency run by lawyers, Mr. Bove’s actions after her resignation were even more troubling than his order that she drop the case. Mr. Bove did not try to give the same instruction to another person in her office in New York. In fact, he placed several of Ms. Sassoon’s deputies on paid leave pending an investigation of their role in the episode.</p><p>Instead, he took the unusual step of rerouting his demand to career officials in Washington, and fared no better.</p><p>Two senior lawyers, who had been tapped for interim leadership positions by the Trump administration, resigned. Current and former officials pointed out that what Mr. Bove asked them to do may well violate bar rules and their oath — to dismiss a criminal case without having reviewed the facts or the law.</p><p>Later, three other officials in the department’s public integrity unit also refused to follow Mr. Bove’s directive and resigned.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Days earlier, Ms. Bondi issued a memo insisting that Justice Department lawyers could not avoid signing legal documents they happened to disagree with. Given that explicit instruction, Mr. Bove’s demands for someone in the department to sign the document carry an unspoken threat, these officials said — do it or leave.</p><p>Mr. Bove, in a memo to Ms. Sassoon this week, said his order for dismissal was not based on questions about the evidence collected by prosecutors, but because the charges filed against the mayor last fall came too close to the 2025 mayoral election and created the appearance that the indictment was intended to influence the outcome.</p><p>He also claimed that the indictment, which resulted in the stripping of Mr. Adams’s security clearance, made it harder for the mayor to cooperate with the administration on immigration enforcement. The assertion amounted to a highly unusual injection of a policy issue into a criminal case.</p><p>“There is no room at the Justice Department for attorneys who refuse to execute on the priorities of the executive branch,” Mr. Bove wrote on Thursday, adding that he looked forward to working with the U.S. attorney’s office “on the important priorities President Trump has laid out for us to make America safe again.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice and has also written about gun violence, civil rights and conditions in the country’s jails and prisons.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/glenn-thrush">More about Glenn Thrush</a></span></p></div><div><p>Adam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.
