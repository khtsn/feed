But The Times obtained a copy of the research and shared it with five doctors and scientists with expertise in research, antidoping efforts and toxicology.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>All five said that the research was not nearly as unequivocal as the Chinese made it out to be.</p><p>“Their conclusions are not intellectually honest,” said Dr. David Juurlink, the head of the Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Toronto, who reviewed the data. “They make a conclusion that is not backed up by what they found in their study. If you submitted this to a scientific journal worth its salt, that conclusion would be laughed at.”</p><p>Faced with scrutiny for its handling of the episode and others like it, the World Anti-Doping Agency has cited China’s science as it has tried to deflect criticism that it looked the other way when confronting a pattern of positive tests among Chinese athletes.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
