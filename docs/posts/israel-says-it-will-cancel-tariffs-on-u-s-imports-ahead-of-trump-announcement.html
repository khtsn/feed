    <h1>Israel Says It Will Cancel Tariffs on U.S. Imports Ahead of Trump Announcement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Total U.S. trade with Israel amounted to an estimated $37 billion in 2024, and the U.S. bilateral deficit stood at $7.4 billion, an 8.6 percent increase over the previous year, according to U.S. <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/middle-eastnorth-africa/israel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trade data</a>. Israeli import taxes on U.S. goods amount to $11.3 million annually, with most levied on food, according to Israelâ€™s finance ministry.</p><p>Mr. Trump has already imposed several major tranches of tariffs, including ones that apply broadly to imports from China, Canada and Mexico. He has also announced tariffs on imported cars and car parts, which are set to go into effect on Thursday.</p><p>The Trump administration has given few details about which countries and sectors will be included in the tariffs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/economy/trump-tariffs.html" title="">announcement on Wednesday</a>, and it was not clear whether the levies would affect Israel.</p><p>Israel was the latest country to adopt measures that appear designed to forestall the imposition of any American levies. In one example, Mexico has sent accused cartel leaders to the United States to face criminal charges and dispatched troops to fentanyl laboratories and the U.S. border.</p><p>Mr. Trump has said that the latest tariffs will be imposed on adversaries like China as well as on countries that have traditionally been considered allies of the United States.</p></div></div>
