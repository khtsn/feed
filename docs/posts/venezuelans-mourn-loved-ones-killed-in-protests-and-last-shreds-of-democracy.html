    <h1>Venezuelans Mourn Loved Ones Killed in Protests, and Last Shreds of Democracy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Jeison Gabriel España left home on July 28 to vote for the first — and last — time in his brief life.</p><p>A day after casting his ballot in a presidential election that had united millions of Venezuelans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/world/americas/venezuela-election-opposition-machado.html" title="">in a call for change</a>, Mr. España, 18, was shot and killed in the streets.</p><p>The country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/americas/venezuela-election-results.html" title="">had claimed victory</a>, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-election-results.html" title="">overwhelming evidence</a> that the opposition candidate had won. Then he sent security forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/world/americas/venezuela-election-maduro.html" title="">to crush dissent</a>.</p><p>“Why did they kill my child?” Mr. España’s aunt, who raised him, cried at his funeral.</p><p>Now, Venezuela is in mourning, not just for the roughly <a href="https://x.com/MonitorVictimas/status/1822079929799893352" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">24 people dead</a> amid violent demonstrations but also for the last shreds of a long-tattered democracy. Whatever small spaces still existed for resistance in the country are vanishing by the day, if not the hour, as an angry Mr. Maduro pummels an electorate that tried to vote him out.</p></div></div><div><div><p>For years, many Venezuelan families splintered by migration believed that they would eventually unite in an improved, if perhaps not wholly democratic, Venezuela. Following the election, many are burying that dream.</p><p>“I will never return to Venezuela,” said one young woman, a data scientist living in Chile, asking that her name not be published because her mother and other relatives remain in her home country. “Venezuela has become my worst nightmare.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/18/world/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/18/world/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/18/world/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Three women and a man stand looking at a coffin draped in yellow and red flowers." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/18/world/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/18/world/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/18/world/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/18/world/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02/18Venezuela-Deaths-New-02-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Friends and family gathered to mourn Mr. España, who voted for the first time the day before he was killed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The burial of Mr. España.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>In Caracas, the capital, the police are setting up checkpoints to search phones for any signs of dissent. <a href="https://x.com/Beadrian/status/1823109891474497630?t=a184F3SvcDF8vzKErI_66w&amp;s=08" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Black X marks are appearing</a> on the homes of supposed opposition voters. Security forces are rounding up everyday citizens over the smallest indications of protest.</p></div><div><div><p>Once it was mostly activists who risked arrest. But more than <a href="https://foropenal.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,400 people</a> have been detained in recent weeks, according to a watchdog group, Penal Forum. Many are everyday citizens, and more than 100 are under 18. The authorities are canceling passports of human rights activists and others, trapping them in the country. Journalists are fleeing amid tips that the intelligence police are after them.</p><p>On Saturday, members of the National Guard <a href="https://efectococuyo.com/la-humanidad/funcionarios-de-la-gnb-se-llevan-detenido-a-sacerdote-de-machiques/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dragged away a priest</a> in the state of Zulia as his congregation watched.</p><p>“Christ, prince of peace,” they sang, falling to their knees as he disappeared from sight.</p><p>In the past, the government generally avoided arresting church figures.</p><p>The country’s opposition leaders, Edmundo González and María Corina Machado, have tried to maintain a message of optimism. While their public appearances have been rare since the vote, they have not been arrested.</p><p>On Saturday, as part of a global rally meant to support their movement, hundreds gathered in Caracas, despite the government’s deployment of thousands of security forces throughout the city.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“We are not afraid!” opposition supporters shouted, many waving photocopies of the “actas,” or tally sheets, printed at voting machines on July 28.</p><p>Ms. Machado was there, delivering a speech from the roof of a truck. But Mr. González did not make an appearance. Attending such rallies carries a high risk of detention — for leaders and supporters — and it’s unclear how long these events can last.</p><p>For the most part, censorship reigns.</p><p>“Freedom!” two people dared to shout at the funeral procession for Olinger Montaño, a 24-year-old barber who died the same day as Mr. España.</p><p>Other mourners quickly hushed them. At the cemetery in Caracas, where Mr. Montaño’s mother sobbed over his coffin, no one called for justice or ventured to raise the tricolor national flag.</p></div></div><div><p>“Today it was him,” said one friend, “and now it could be us.”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Olinger Montaño’s burial in Caracas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Grieving for Mr. Montaño, a 24-year-old barber who died on July 29. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>The New York Times attended the funerals and reviewed the death certificates of five young men killed in protests in the days after the election, and interviewed the families of several others. For their protection, The Times is withholding the names of many people who spoke for this article.</p><p>Mr. Maduro has publicly doubted the veracity of these deaths. Tarek William Saab, the chief prosecutor and a political ally of the president, has said that the dead are not victims, but actors.</p><p>“They fall on the floor, they pour ketchup on the person,” he said at a recent news conference, asserting that the government would find and detain people who had “faked” their deaths.</p><p>Mr. España, the 18-year-old, knew no government other than that of the socialist movement that took power in 1999.</p></div></div><div><div><p>His parents died when he was a boy, and his aunt took him in. They lived in a poor part of Caracas and lacked much. But he did not want to migrate, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/world/americas/why-are-so-many-venezuelans-going-to-the-united-states.html" title="">millions</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/19/world/americas/colombia-venezuela-migrants-refugees.html" title="">other Venezuelans</a> had done. He wanted to vote.</p><p>A day after casting his ballot, Mr. España went with neighbors to protest for the first time in his life, his aunt said. But Mr. Maduro had already sent security forces and allied gangs, called colectivos, into the streets. That evening, Mr. España’s aunt<strong> </strong>received a call: Her boy was dead.</p><p>A single gunshot to the chest, reads his death certificate. It is unclear who killed him.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bidding goodbye to Mr. España, who was shot in the chest. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. España’s friends and family dropping flowers on his grave.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The July 28 election pitted Mr. Maduro, in power since 2013, against Mr. González, a previously little-known former diplomat who had the backing of Ms. Machado, a popular opposition leader.</p></div><div><div><p>Mr. Maduro has long held elections to add the appearance of legitimacy to his authoritarian government, often manipulating the system in his favor.</p><p>As this year’s vote approached, few believed that Mr. Maduro would cede power, even if he lost. The United States has offered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/venezuela-president-drug-trafficking-nicolas-maduro.html" title="">a $15 million reward</a> for information leading to his capture, and the International Criminal Court is investigating him for crimes against humanity. Both make him vulnerable if he leaves office.</p><p>Still, the overwhelming support for the González-Machado movement lit a flame in many who held out for a miracle. Maybe Mr. Maduro would concede and flee to a friendly nation?</p><p>Then, after polls closed, Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela’s legislature and a powerful Maduro ally, <a href="https://x.com/AlbertoRodNews/status/1817715924914340021" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appeared on television</a>. “We can’t tell you the results,” he said, grinning widely, “but we can show you our faces.”</p><p>The government <a href="https://x.com/cneesvzla/status/1819459661114102120" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claims</a> that Mr. Maduro won 52 percent of the vote but has not shared evidence to back this up. The opposition, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-election-results.html" title="">which has collected printed tallies from more than 80 percent</a> of ballot boxes and posted them online, says Mr. González won with 67 percent of the vote.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Maduro’s assertion of victory has been the subject of widespread condemnation; even normally conservative political analysts have called the election an outright steal.</p><p>The United States has said it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/americas/venezuela-election-gonzalez-maduro.html" title="">considers Mr. González the victor</a>.
