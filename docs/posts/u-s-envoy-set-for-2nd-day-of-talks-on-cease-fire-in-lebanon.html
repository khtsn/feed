    <h1>U.S. Envoy Set for 2nd Day of Talks on Cease-Fire in Lebanon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A top U.S. envoy was set to meet with Lebanese officials for a second day on Wednesday, making it an unusually long visit amid cautious optimism over a potential cease-fire agreement in the war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.</p><p>The second day of meetings in Beirut involving Amos Hochstein, the senior Biden administration envoy, was reported by Lebanese news outlets and confirmed by a Lebanese official briefed on the negotiations, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. The official said Mr. Hochstein might continue on to Israel depending on the outcome of discussions in Beirut.</p><p>During repeated rounds of shuttle diplomacy over the past year, Mr. Hochstein has seldom stayed overnight in Lebanon, so the extended visit may be an indication that negotiations are inching forward.</p><p>Mr. Hochstein said at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/middleeast/us-envoy-lebanon-israel-hezbollah.html" title="">a news conference on Tuesday</a> that the gaps between the two warring sides had “narrowed” in discussions in recent weeks, though ultimately any results from the negotiations would be “the decision of the parties.” He spoke after meeting with Nabih Berri, the speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, a Hezbollah ally who has emerged as the group’s point man in the U.S.-led negotiations.</p></div></div>
