Flags were waved. Veterans were cheered. USA signs were handed out.</p><p>“We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world,” she said as she neared the dramatic finish of her speech. She was seeking to occupy some of the most frequently trod ground of winning American campaigns.</p><p>She repeatedly tried to find popular proposals. Protecting Social Security. Lowering health care costs. Cutting taxes. And, in a sign of how the politics of abortion have shifted since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, an extended riff on reproductive rights.</p><p>She also told stories of her own life that were at once new to the audience and yet familiar to millions of Americans. Of divorce and moving vans. Of living “in the flats” instead of the wealthier hills. Of her mother’s reliance on a “trusted circle” of friends to raise her and her sister.</p><p>She outlined a biting critique of Mr. Trump that Mr. Biden first floated but never successfully prosecuted.</p></div></div><div><p>“My entire career, I’ve only had one client: the people,” she said of her career of public service. It set up a searing contrast with Mr. Trump, who quickly called into Fox News to give his review of her speech when she was done. “The only client he has ever had,” she said of Mr. Trump. “Himself.”</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>1:01</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Kenan Thompson Speaks at the D.N.C.</h2><h4>Kenan Thompson, the comedian and actor, walked onstage at the convention with a large prop book that said “Project 2025.”</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>This is Project 2025, the Republican blueprint for a second Trump term. You ever seen a document that could kill a small animal and democracy at the same time? Well, these are the terms and conditions of a second Trump presidency. You vote for him. You vote for all of this. Let’s take a look. Project 2025 calls for the elimination of protections for L.G.B.T.Q.+ Americans. Project 2025 calls for millions of people like yourself to pay more for prescription drugs like insulin. Project 2025 resurrects a law from the 1800s called the Comstock Act to ban abortion nationwide and throw health care providers in jail. Everything that we just talked about is very real. It is in this book. You can stop it from ever happening by electing Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/22/multimedia/22pol-takeaways-trump-pcmq/22pol-takeaways-trump-pcmq-square640.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Kenan Thompson, the comedian and actor, walked onstage at the convention with a large prop book that said “Project 2025.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><div><h2 id="link-44c9be81">Biden built Trump up. Harris sought to cut him down.</h2><p>Back when Mr. Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee, there was little evidence that he could mobilize voters solely around the idea of voting for him. So his campaign instead put a magnifying glass on Mr. Trump, trying to make him a larger-than-life figure with dire warnings of the threat he posed.</p><p>The Harris convention set out to diminish him.</p><p>Former President Barack Obama mocked Mr. Trump’s obsession with crowd sizes with a suggestive hand gesture. When Democrats gave a prime-time speech to a Republican former congressman, Adam Kinzinger, he said of Mr. Trump, “He is a small man pretending to be big.”</p><p>Ms. Harris delivered the final word: She called her rival “an unserious man.”</p><p>Yes, there have been nightly warnings about the grave policy implications of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/project-2025.html" title="">Project 2025</a>.” But those segments have been leavened with humor, including when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/project-2025-kenan-thompson.html" title="">Kenan Thompson of “Saturday Night Live” fame</a> lugged an oversize book of the 922-page Republican blueprint onstage.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“You ever seen a document that could kill a small animal and democracy at the same time?” he asked.</p><p>There was a new lightness to the way Ms. Harris and other Democrats tried to frame the potential for Mr. Trump to bring darkness.</p><p>“Simply put,” she said in one of the evening’s most memorable lines, “they are out of their minds.”</p></div></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p><div data-testid="transcript-playback-controls"><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 36" id="el_0kpS9qL_S"><title>bars</title><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_65hRV2Qwn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC_ILVvi2tqx" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_oZ84Hna1GC"><rect x="34" width="6" height="36" id="el_qw_T_tngXw"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_p_9Pm85Ac" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU_WxG3R40yd" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_mYVjkduhMU"><rect x="22.67" width="6" height="36" id="el_lf9GrROk6j"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_kYNRGDfcw" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw_3c3bzSjOJ" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_o-EuxhgoAw"><rect x="11.33" width="6" height="36" id="el_-iueO8klO0"></rect></g></g></g><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_y_fKcpSxn" data-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="0"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC_R6bNB6_Ys" ata-animator-group="true" data-animator-type="2"><g id="el_F7mSMPhqpC"><rect width="6" height="36" id="el_dS5TKNZZ5w"></rect></g></g></g></svg></p><div><div><p>0:00</p><!-- --><p>/</p><!-- --><p>1:25</p></div><div><p>-</p><!-- --><p>0:00</p></div></div></div></div></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Harris Accepts Democratic Nomination</h2><h4>Vice President Kamala Harris ceremonially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for president on Thursday.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>[playing “Freedom.”] Thank you all.

No matter that she already holds an office in the West Wing. Or that her party is already in power.</p><p>Over and over, convention speakers repeated her new slogan (“A New Way Forward”) and declared that it was Ms. Harris who would usher in a new future. They tried to relegate Mr. Trump to a figure of the past.</p><p>“Let us choose the sweet promise of tomorrow over the bitter return to yesterday,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/oprah-winfrey-kamala-harris-dnc.html" title="">Oprah Winfrey said</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Republicans cast the effort as an audacious rewriting of the present and predicted that she would be saddled with the record of the current Biden-Harris administration, especially on the economy and immigration. The intensity of her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-democrats-dnc.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb" title="">ongoing skirmish with Mr. Trump over who is likelier to break the status quo</a> is proof itself of the importance of the fight.</p><p>“Something wonderfully magical is in the air,” said Michelle Obama, the former first lady, who made a rhetorical passing of the baton between the Obama era and a potential Harris one. In doing so, she almost seemed to lump the Trump and Biden years together. Now, she said, the contagious power of hope was re-emerging, calling it “a familiar feeling that’s been buried too deep for far too long.”</p><p>Ms. Harris’s candidacy is only weeks old, but some of the loudest interruptions of her speech came when the crowd chanted, “We’re not going back!”, a forward-leaning posture that has become a rallying cry.</p><p>Ms. Harris hammered home the point herself, describing the election as “a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Throughout the week, activists representing key issues for the party spoke on a dimly lit stage.

The party sounded far more interested in ensuring that Ms. Harris can reach the White House in the first place. There were some policies highlighted. The expansion of abortion rights. Restrictions on guns.</p><p>But with only 75 days until the election, Democrats sounded more than happy to give Ms. Harris room to position herself in whatever way she thinks is needed to defeat Mr. Trump. She has backtracked on fracking, flipped on “Medicare for all” and recanted on not considering border crossings criminal — all with little blowback.</p><p>In short, the party is embracing practicality over policy particulars.</p><p>Ms. Harris directly addressed a chief vulnerability — immigration — by vowing to sign border-security legislation that Mr. Trump had scuttled.</p><p>Outside the convention perimeter, pro-Palestinian protesters voiced their anger with the administration. But inside, Ms. Harris faced little pressure on the Gaza war — or on almost any other issue. She did, however, speak extensively and confidently on the Mideast conflict, firmly stating that Israel had a right to defend itself while also calling for self-determination for the Palestinian people.</p><p>Ms. Harris has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-raleigh-nc-economy.html" title="">rolled out an economic agenda</a> that includes new money for first-time homeowners, the construction of three million new homes and measures against price gouging on food. Yet the specifics were not what energized most attendees this week.</p></div></div><div><p>It was the possibility of making history with Ms. Harris — and, of course, stopping Mr. Trump.</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Many Democrats in the audience on Thursday wore symbolic suffragette white, though Ms. Harris herself wore a dark suit.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-1056c5f4">Democrats are riding high. The hard part comes next.</h2><p>Democrats in Chicago relished the good feelings of Ms. Harris’s upward trajectory in the polls. She has staked out a lead of two percentage points in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html" title="">The New York Times polling average</a> after trailing by five points in a then-hypothetical matchup at the start of July.</p><p>But party leaders are still warning against complacency.</p><p>“Let us not forget what we are up against,” Mrs. Obama cautioned on Tuesday.</p><p>It was, after all, only a month ago that the other party was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/rnc-trump-takeaways.html" title="">riding high off its own convention</a>. Then it was Republicans who felt like a party of destiny after Mr. Trump had survived an assassination attempt and Mr. Biden’s party was still tearing itself apart.</p><p>While some Democrats are privately beginning to dream that Ms. Harris’s momentum might carry her for another 10-plus weeks, many are bracing for the likelihood of stumbles against the most unpredictable of opponents.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“What we had prior to this point is an enthusiasm problem, quite frankly,” Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia said in a brief interview on Thursday. “So we need all of this enthusiasm. But enthusiasm shouldn’t short-circuit discipline.”</p><p>Mr. Warnock, who is also the lead pastor at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, then reached for a parallel in Scripture. “This is the mountaintop experience,” he said. “Then you’ve got to go into the valley. But the mountaintop gets you ready.”</p><p>Taylor Robinson<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Shane Goldmacher is a national political correspondent, covering the 2024 campaign and the major developments, trends and forces shaping American politics.
