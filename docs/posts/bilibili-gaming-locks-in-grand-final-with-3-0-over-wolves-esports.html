</span> in a 2-1 thriller and broke the world champions&#39; eight-international streak. On the other side of the bracket, Wolves struggled to overcome XLG in the upper final, failing to close out a 12-8 lead on the second map. </p>

<p>The best-of-five began on BLG&#39;s first map pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/473243/wolves-esports-vs-bilibili-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1-lbf/?game=212252&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Pearl</a>. BLG opened with a 4-2 lead on their attack after winning the pistol, but two low buy wins from Wolves in the later stages of the half enabled them to take a 7-5 lead. </p>

<p>BLG closed the gap immediately with another pistol round and went on to open up a lead of their own with well-coordinated holds and retakes, ultimately winning the last five rounds in a row to take the map 13-9. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4885/whzy">

</span>&#39;s Operator played a crucial role in securing advantages for his team as the Yoru player found 12 of his 17 kills on defense, while <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/48878/rushia">
		rushia	</a>
</span> impressed throughout with a server-leading 21/9/9 KDA and eight total multikills on Astra. </p>


<p><em>nephh and rushia turn the tides with a 2v5 bonus conversion.</em></p>

<p>The second map went to Wolves&#39; pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/473243/wolves-esports-vs-bilibili-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1-lbf/?game=212253&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>, where both teams opted into a Neon-Breach-Tejo mirror match. Wolves looked in control in the first half, leveraging their Initiator utility to consistently shut down BLG&#39;s attempts at taking map control and ended the first half up 8-4. The map seemed theirs for the taking after they won the second pistol, but a Thrifty win for BLG opened the way for a comeback and they went on to steal away Lotus 13-9. </p>

<p>whzy once again demonstrated enormous impact for his side, winning key duels in almost every round in the second half. The Neon ended the map with 26 kills, seven first kills, and 313 ACS. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/14125/spring">
		Spring	</a>
</span> put up similarly impressive numbers for Wolves with 27 kills and 330 ACS on Viper, but it wasn&#39;t enough for them to close it out.</p>


<p><em>whzy mows down three as the spearhead of his team&#39;s defense.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vlr.gg/473243/wolves-esports-vs-bilibili-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1-lbf/?game=212254&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Icebox</a> was the final map. The first half was a back-and-forth brawl; BLG took an early 5-2 lead with aggressive fights into A main and B main on their defense, but Wolves brought it back to an eventual 6-6 half with a blend of A hits and individual brilliance from Juicy and Spring. The second half, on the other hand, was all BLG as they stormed through the sites, winning all but one round on their attack and taking the map 13-7. whzy&#39;s dominance continued, racking up 24 kills and five first kills on Jett for a total of 67 kills, 17 first kills, and 168 ADR over the course of the series. </p>


<p><em>Another bonus 1v2, this time from nephh, gave BLG all the momentum they needed.</em></p>

<p>With this win, BLG ends Wolves&#39; playoff run and sets their sights on the grand final matchup versus XLG tomorrow. The winner will earn their first-ever tier 1 VCT title, be crowned the new kings of China, and receive the coveted first regional seed at Toronto.</p>
