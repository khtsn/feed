Initial reports indicated a man with a weapon and people being set on fire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Our initial call, as I mentioned, was a report that someone was setting people on fire,” Chief Redfearn said. “That is fairly consistent with the injuries that we found on scene, but we’re not 100 percent certain how that happened.”</p><p>A suspect was identified and pointed out to officers at the scene. The suspect, who had minor injuries, was taken into custody, the chief said. Videos on social media showed the man, shirtless and holding two bottles, shouting while bystanders helped injured people nearby. Patches of grass in front of the courthouse were on fire.</p><p>A joint statement from Boulder’s Jewish community said that an “incendiary device” was thrown at walkers at the <a href="https://run4lives.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Run for Their Lives event</a>.</p><p>Rachel Dvora Amaru, leader of the group, was not part of Sunday’s event but said she has close friends who were hospitalized. The weekly walks, she said, have been held since the Thanksgiving after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel. </p><p>“Our walk has been nothing ever but peaceful, and this was a blatant act of antisemitism on the streets of Boulder, Colorado,” Ms. Amaru said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The attack is the latest on the Jewish community in recent weeks. On May 21, two people were shot and killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., after which the suspect shouted “Free Palestine.” In April, a man set fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. The suspect later said that it was a response to Israeli attacks on Palestinians.</p><p>“As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.”</p><p>Phil Weiser, attorney general of Colorado, said in a statement that “this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.”</p><p>“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he added. “Hate has no place in Colorado.”</p><p>Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the F.B.I., said that bureau personnel were on the scene.</p><p>“We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence,” <a href="https://x.com/FBIDDBongino/status/1929289348307890451" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said on social media.</a> “All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Branch writes feature stories for The Times on a wide swath of topics, including sports, climate and politics.
