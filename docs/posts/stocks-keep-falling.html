The dollar fell, as did oil prices.

But the president has stuck to his guns; he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/trump-tariffs-us-economy-prices.html" title="">likened the levies to a painful medical procedure</a> to rescue an economy that he described as a “sick patient.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Protesters at the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., today. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rod Lamkey Jr. for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6e3f1563">A judge ordered the return of a mistakenly deported man</h2><p>A federal judge today gave the Trump administration three days to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/trump-deportations-maryland-man-el-salvador.html" title="">secure the return of a Maryland man</a> who was inadvertently deported to El Salvador last month despite a court order allowing him to stay in the U.S.</p><p>The judge said that the administration had acted without “legal basis” when it arrested the man, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/maryland-man-deportation-error-el-salvador.html" title="">Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</a>, and put him on a plane — without due process — to a notorious Salvadoran prison.</p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Juan Arredondo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-4995cbd4">Trump granted TikTok another reprieve</h2><p>Trump announced today that the popular video app <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/technology/trump-tiktok-deadline-delay.html" title="">TikTok could continue to operate in the U.S. for another 75 days</a>, effectively overriding — for the second time this year — a federal law requiring TikTok’s Chinese owners to sell it or face a ban. TikTok had been facing a deadline tomorrow to comply with the law, which passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court.</p><p>The delay came after tense, last-minute negotiations.
