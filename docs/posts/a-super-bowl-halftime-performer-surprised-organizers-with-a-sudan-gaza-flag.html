    <h1>A Super Bowl Halftime Performer Surprised Organizers With a Sudan-Gaza Flag</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There it was, in the corner of the screen during the climactic moment of Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday: A protester unfurling a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag just as Lamar — and the entire stadium — sang the “it’s probably A-<em>minooooor</em>” punchline from his chart-topping diss track “Not Like Us.”</p><p>The N.F.L. said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member field cast.</p><p>“The individual hid the item on his possession and unveiled it late in the show,” the league said. “No one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.”</p><p>A representative for Roc Nation, the entertainment company behind the halftime show, said in a statement, “The act by the individual was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.”</p><p>Amid the dozens of dancers in red, white, blue and black, the individual could be seen standing on the hood of the stage’s centerpiece, a Buick Grand National GNX, the rare car for which Lamar named his latest album, “GNX.” Images from the ground and clips on social media showed a person in black sweats — matching the extras onstage — with “Sudan” and “Gaza” written on the white swath of the flags, alongside a heart and a solidarity fist.</p></div></div>
