David Goodman has reported from Cameron County and the area around where the new town of Starbase, Texas, would be located.</p></div></div></div></div><p><time datetime="2024-12-24T05:03:06-05:00">Dec. 24, 2024, <span>5:03 a.m. ET</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Over the past few years, Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/texas-elon-musk.html" title="">expanded his footprint in Texas</a>, moving his companies from California and building offices, warehouses and manufacturing plants across a growing number of Texas counties.</p><p>Now Mr. Musk is trying to do something that few, if any, titans of industry have done in a century: create his own company town.</p><p>Mr. Musk has long talked about his desire to make a new town — <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1368915472142401540?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which he hopes to call Starbase</a> — in coastal South Texas, where his rocket launch company, SpaceX, is based.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For years, the plan did not appear to be moving forward in any official way, in part because creating a new municipality in Texas requires a certain number of residents and support from a majority of voters.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But in that time, SpaceX employees have packed into newly refurbished midcentury homes and temporary housing — some of it in the form of silver Airstream trailers — in the shadow of the company’s rockets.</p><p>Then this month, company employees who live around its offices and launch site took the first major step toward incorporating a town, gathering signatures and filing an official petition to hold an election.</p><p>The petition, filed with top officials in Cameron County and shared with The New York Times based on a public records request, provides some of the first details on the size and the operation of the new city that Mr. Musk and his company are envisioning.</p><p>If authorized by the county, the election would allow voters to cast a ballot for a slate of three new city officials, including the city’s first mayor. The petition suggests that the mayor will be SpaceX’s security manager, Gunnar Milburn.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This is a very unique situation,” said Alan Bojorquez, a lawyer in Austin who specializes in helping groups of Texas residents through the process of incorporating new towns. He said he had never helped a company that wanted its employees to form their own town.</p><p>The Starbase petition describes a community of around 500 current inhabitants, including at least 219 primary residents and more than 100 children, in an area at the very end of State Highway 4 by Boca Chica Beach, where SpaceX launches many of its rockets.</p><p>The town would be about 1.5 square miles, a little larger than Central Park but small by Texas standards.</p><p>Nearly everyone is a renter and works at SpaceX, according to the petition.</p><p>There are few examples in Texas of such company towns, though there is one north of Houston where the founder of the Texas Renaissance Festival created the town of Todd Mission <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/The-rural-Texas-city-where-King-George-14563646.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and became its mayor</a>.</p><p>And Mr. Musk may not be content with just one new town. He has already looked into the possibility of housing employees in a development outside the town of Bastrop, near Austin. The area is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/texas-elon-musk.html" title="">home to a swiftly growing campus for Musk companies</a>, including a manufacturing plant for SpaceX; the headquarters of the Boring Company, which is creating tunneling technology; and, soon, offices for the social media platform X.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It was not clear from the petition why Mr. Musk and his company were seeking to create the new town of Starbase nor what benefit they might obtain from doing so.</p><p>Mr. Bojorquez said that most new towns were created by people who live in unincorporated areas and want to prevent their area from being gobbled up by an expanding city, or to keep a particularly undesirable business from moving in.</p><p>The new town being proposed by Mr. Musk could create its own police or fire departments, or issue its own ordinances. But it would not have to.</p><p>“Cities are required by law to do very little,” Mr. Bojorquez said. One of the biggest practical issues is road maintenance, which would no longer be handled by the county.</p><p>Of course, incorporation allows communities to elect their own local leaders, and also to create municipal utility systems, such as for water. As a city, Starbase would be eligible for state and federal grants, would have certain immunity from lawsuits and could also condemn property, Mr. Bojorquez said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In a letter filed along with the petition, Kathryn Lueders, SpaceX’s general manager for Starbase, said that the company needed “the ability to grow Starbase as a community,” and noted that SpaceX “currently performs civil functions” because of its remote location, including managing utilities and providing schooling and medical care.</p><p>“Incorporation would move the management of some of these functions to a more appropriate public body,” Ms. Lueders wrote <a href="https://x.com/jessica_kirsh/status/1867468714523996224" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in her letter to the Cameron County judge</a>, who is the county’s top executive and must approve the petition if it meets all of the legal requirements.</p><p>For years, SpaceX has run into local opposition in Cameron County from environmental groups over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/us/politics/spacex-boca-chica-takeaways.html" title="">the effect of large-scale and frequent launches on the nearby protected coastal ecology</a>. And residents and officials from Brownsville, about 20 miles away, have at times complained that launches <a href="https://www.krgv.com/news/cameron-county-da-sends-letter-to-spacex-over-highway-closures-possible-state-law-violations/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shut down roads</a> and cut them off from the beach.</p><p>Previously, the company had appeared interested only in having the area’s name changed for the purposes of postal delivery. An application to do so is pending before a federal agency.</p><p>“We thought that was what they were really looking for, but I guess they wanted to extend that a little further,” the county judge, Eddie Treviño Jr., said in an interview. “Obviously, they think that there’s some advantage to it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Treviño said that the county’s legal team and elections office were studying the petition to see if it met the legal requirements. “I’m waiting to hear back from them,” he said. An election could be scheduled next year.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A SpaceX rocket in South Texas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Meridith Kohut for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The proposed new mayor, Mr. Milburn, declined to comment when reached by phone on Monday. So did others who signed the petition.</p><p>Cayetana Polanco, who lives on Memes Street, which is within the proposed new town, said she was looking forward to the creation of the city of Starbase and hoped that it could be “a model of what new cities should be.” She said that she did not work for SpaceX but that her husband did.</p><p>“If all goes through with this petition, my baby might be the first child born in this city,” she added. “It would be pretty epic!”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Nearly all of the residents who live in the area work for SpaceX or have family members who do. Most live in company-owned houses clustered around the company’s main buildings, including at least one restaurant, open only to SpaceX employees.</p><p>“SpaceX is the predominant landowner in the proposed Starbase area and, with only a few exceptions, owns all the real property,” Richard Cardile, the senior manager of spaceport operations for SpaceX, wrote in an affidavit as part of the petition.</p><p>The company, he added, keeps “detailed records of all individuals who reside in each dwelling unit in the proposed city of Starbase.”</p><p>For those reasons, if county officials greenlight an election, voters appeared likely to be supportive.</p><p>One of them, presumably, would be Mr. Musk himself. He was not among those who signed the petition. But he has a residence in Cameron County, and has said he voted there in November.</p><p>Alain Delaquérière contributed research.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
