    <h1>Marco Rubio Says Someone in Signal Chat Made ‘Big Mistake’ in Adding Journalist</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mr. Rubio confirmed the substance of his part of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/25/us/signal-group-chat-text-annotations.html" title="">text messages that have been published</a> by Mr. Goldberg. Mr. Rubio said he took part in the chat twice: once to name a point of contact for his office, his chief of staff, Michael Needham; and a second time to congratulate the team on the operation once the American military had carried out lethal strikes against the Houthi forces in Yemen.</p><p>“The Pentagon has made it clear that nothing on there would have endangered the lives or the mission,” Mr. Rubio said of the Signal chat texts. “There were no war plans on there.”</p><p>Mr. Goldberg has said the chat material included war plans, and on Wednesday The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> detailed texts of the portion of the chat that Mr. Goldberg witnessed and recorded. That included lines from Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary and former Fox News talk-show host, on weapons systems, weather conditions and the precise movements of human targets.</p><p>Mr. Rubio said in Kingston that the chat had been set up for the purposes of “coordinating” among Mr. Trump’s top foreign policy aides so they could inform their counterparts in other countries and other American officials about the strikes when the moment was right to do so.</p><p>“When these things happen, I need to call foreign ministers, especially among our close allies,” he said. “We need to notify members of Congress.”</p></div></div>
