At least 175 people have died, making Helene the deadliest hurricane to strike the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. It’s unclear how many people are still missing.</p><p>“It’s going to take a long haul to restore these communities,” Biden said.</p><p>In Asheville, N.C., a fast-growing city in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains, water access remains a stubborn problem. Some towns in southern Appalachia that were effectively knocked off the grid have turned to methods that have been out of date for a century or more, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/hurricane-helene-north-carolina.html" title="">town meetings where everyone gathers for daily updates</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke from an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon today.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Atef Safadi/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-4bd5be0">Israeli troops clashed with Hezbollah</h2><p>Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants said today that they were fighting at close range in southern Lebanon.

However, it took Russia nearly three years of attacks to capture Vuhledar, and signs have emerged that both armies have grown exhausted after years of fighting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When it comes to inexplicable fashion phenomena, nothing tops the one-leg pant.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Simbarashe Cha/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-7adc4f72">Fashion month just ended.

But there were few satisfying answers about what’s next in style, our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman wrote.</p><p>Yesterday, however, Miu Miu and Louis Vuitton closed out Paris Fashion Week with a revelation. They didn’t worry about the confusion; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/style/paris-fashion-week-trends.html" title="">they embraced it</a>, combining fancy fabrics with athleisure or pouffy 16th-century jackets with biker shorts.

Its layers of almond-scented cake, fluffy mascarpone frosting and fresh mixed berries have attracted a sizable cult following and even become a staple at weddings.</p><p>The grocery chain promised it wasn’t getting rid of the cake, but rather tweaking the recipe to standardize it across all stores.
