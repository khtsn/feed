The appearance was the latest stop in a blitz of ads and appearances that the Harris campaign hopes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/harris-black-voters-trump.html" title="">will convince Black voters to stick with the Democratic ticket</a>.</p><p>Nationally, Harris is supported by a vast majority of Black voters. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html" title="">a recent Times poll</a> found that she was underperforming President Biden’s support in 2020 by roughly 10 percentage points, and by 15 points among Black men.</p><p>Young Black men in particular said they feel disillusioned by the political system and do not see how Harris’s policies could help them. Their apathy and frustration have provided an opening for Donald Trump.</p><p>That’s why Harris’s campaign has, for the first time, begun to directly confront the growing alienation of Black voters. Her campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/harris-policies-black-men.html" title="">released a policy agenda</a> targeted heavily at Black men, including forgiving a portion of small-business loans, supporting mentorship and apprenticeship programs and a program that would help stem health inequities for Black men.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Humanitarian aid trucks waiting at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amr Nabil/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-6fde3c3f">The U.S. gave Israel an ultimatum on Gaza aid</h2><p>The U.S. warned Israel to increase the flow of humanitarian supplies into the Gaza Strip within the next 30 days <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-us-military-aid.html" title="">or risk losing military aid</a>, American officials said.</p><p>U.S. and U.N. officials have warned in recent weeks that conditions are deteriorating further in Gaza, where Israel has placed restrictions on the delivery of international aid.

Yet it’s still nearly impossible to secure a reservation if you’re not a celebrity (Rihanna and Kim Kardashian are regulars). So my colleague Priya Krishna dined at all four of Carbone’s U.S. locations — in New York, Miami, Dallas and Las Vegas — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/dining/carbone-las-vegas-new-york-miami-dallas.html" title="">to explain to the rest of us what it’s like</a>.</p><p>Priya found the food to be tasty but inconsistent. The restaurant’s famous everyone-is-a-V.I.P. experience — which felt fresh in 2013 — showed signs of wear.

We photographed 47 students and their first-day outfits at middle schools across the country to get a sense of what’s trending among young people. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/magazine/kids-first-day-school-style.html" title="">Check out their looks</a>.</p><p>Cargo pants were everywhere, and so were stacked bracelets, brightly colored hair and ’90s looks.
