    <h1>Newsmax Made Defamatory Statements About Dominion, Judge Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Dominion spokeswoman said in a statement, “We are gratified by the court’s thorough ruling.”</p><p>Dominion sued Newsmax in August 2021, claiming that the channel falsely accused it of election fraud and of rigging vote counts in 18 statements that aired on television, as well as in a social media post.</p><p>A jury will have to decide whether Dominion has proved that Newsmax acted with “actual malice” when it aired the claims — meaning that the defendants knew that what they were broadcasting was false or that they demonstrated a reckless disregard for the truth.</p><p>The parties could settle ahead of trial, as Dominion did in its blockbuster defamation case against Fox News, which resulted in a $787.5 million settlement on the day a trial was set to start in 2023.</p><p>Newsmax <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/business/media/newsmax-smartmatic-defamation-suit.html" title="">settled</a> a similar defamation lawsuit brought by the voting technology company Smartmatic last year for $<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/newsmax-agreed-pay-40-million-settle-defamation-suit-over-2020-false-election-2025-03-13/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 million</a>, an amount disclosed in March in a regulatory filing.</p><p>Partly because of the costs incurred by the defamation cases, Newsmax filed for an initial public offering, making its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/media/newsmax-stock-ipo.html" title="">stock market debut</a> on March 31. Its stock price has been on a roller coaster, first catapulting to a high of $279 before sharply dropping. On Thursday, it was trading at just over $30 a share.</p></div></div>
