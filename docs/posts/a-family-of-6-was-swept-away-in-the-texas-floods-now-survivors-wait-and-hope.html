Five members of her family from Midland, Texas — her mother, her mother’s husband, an aunt, the aunt’s husband and a cousin — remained missing three days after a torrent of water smashed through their campsite along the Guadalupe River, where they had gathered for what was supposed to be a festive holiday camping trip. </p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Hailey Chavarria’s aunt Tasha Ramos and Ms. Ramos’s husband, Joel Ramos, are among the missing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Hailey Chavarria</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Chavarria’s cousin Kyndall Ramos is missing, too.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Hailey Chavarria</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Only one family member, a 22-year-old cousin, Devyn Smith, was found alive, desperately clinging to a tree. Her rescue was <a href="https://www.ksat.com/video/news/2025/07/06/amazing-rescue-caught-on-camera/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">captured on video</a>, a moment for celebration in days with few of them. She had been dragged downriver more than 15 miles, through three dams, past broken R.V.s and refrigerators, from 4 a.m. to about 10 a.m. on Friday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Ms. Smith remains hospitalized, Ms. Chavarria said, with staples in her head and “every inch of her body” scratched and battered.</p><p>As for the others, “I’m just hoping that they are somewhere,” Ms. Chavarria said, “and even if it’s the worst-case scenario, it’s just something identified and found.” </p><p>“If I dig too deep or consider the worst outcome, I’ll probably lose my mind,” she added, staring at an uneaten sandwich.</p><p>Her family had settled in for the night Thursday, she said, snug in tents erected along the river. The flood that arrived before dawn hours later swamped their tents. They rushed to their vehicles to flee, but the merciless current caught up with them. One Chavarria family truck was found empty and mangled against a tree. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cody Crossland’s truck was found overturned near the campground where the family disappeared during the flood. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>By Sunday, about a dozen relatives, including Ms. Chavarria’s father, Joe Chavarria, had arrived in Kerr County, armed with chain saws and axes to cut through the tangle of trees and jetsam in the last place their family members were seen. On Sunday afternoon, the family gathered outside Calvary Temple Church, where Ms. Chavarria tried her best to keep her older sister, Celeste Helms, 34, from falling apart.</p><p>“We have been going from center to center, and no one can give us an answer,” Ms. Chavarria said. “I’m not blaming any of the people who work at these centers, because you can tell they want to help so bad, right? I think it’s just more of like, they weren’t, as a city or county, weren’t prepared for something like this.”</p><p>“All I can do is stare at my phone,” she added.</p><p>They are holding to hope, though.</p><p>“My mom, she is a beast of a woman,” Ms. Helms said. “I just know she’s hanging out somewhere. She’s too strong.”</p><p>Devyn Smith, the survivor, relayed to Ms. Chavarria the harrowing story. When they went to bed Thursday night, it had begun to drizzle. Around 4 a.m. Friday, the campers were awakened by the rain, Ms. Smith told Ms. Chavarria. They knew their lives were in danger. They had already tried to bolt for safety when their phones blared a flash flood alert.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Ms. Chavarria’s mother, aunt and stepfather and a cousin climbed into their pickup as the waters raged. Some of them tried to warn a second group that had climbed into a smaller car on lower ground. </p><p>“Get out of the car!” they yelled, according to Ms. Smith. That group climbed out through a sunroof as the flood surrounded their small vehicle.</p><p>Then they were not heard of again. Rescuers found the gray truck hours later tilted to its side and smashed into a broken tree. </p><p>Ms. Chavarria described her mother, Michelle Crossland, who recently celebrated her 50th birthday with a big bash, as a “wild lady,” and her husband of 17 years, Cody Crossland, in his mid-40s, as a rugged man who played in a band and was attending barber school. She said Mr. Crossland would have tried everything he could to stay alive.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Chavarria’s mother, Michelle Crossland, and Ms. Crossland’s husband, Cody Crossland, are also missing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Hailey Chavarria</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“All the survival instincts would kick in for him, and he would ground her, because I know she would have been so freaked out,” Ms. Chavarria said.</p><p>The group often traveled together, visiting Las Vegas a few times a year, but this was the first time Ms. Chavarria knew of them camping in the Kerrville area. </p><p>Ms. Chavarria’s sister, Ms. Helms, said her 12-year-old had initially planned to join the family. “Thank God he ended up not going. I can’t even imagine,” she said.</p><p>The family members said that the search had sometimes been a frustrating exercise. There was no point person updating families on the identities of those found, alive or deceased. Ms. Chavarria has resorted to calling funeral homes. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Chavarria, right, and her sister Celeste Helms have been waiting for updates at a shelter in Kerrville, Texas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Can you just tell me if my loved one is in there? That’s all I want to know. Even if they’re deceased,” she said she has pleaded in call after call.</p><p>Another relative, Eric Sanchez, 53, from Midland, stood somberly next to the sisters. </p><p>“I came down as soon as I heard they were missing,” Mr. Sanchez said. “We are just waiting for any news.”</p><p>The parents of Ms. Smith, the rescued cousin, are still missing. But she is recovering, Ms. Chavarria said. </p><p>“I don’t know how she survived,” she said, “if you are a believer, by the grace of God.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Edgar Sandoval covers Texas for The Times, with a focus on the Latino community and the border with Mexico.
