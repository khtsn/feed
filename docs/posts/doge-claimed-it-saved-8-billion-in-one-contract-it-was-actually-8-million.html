    <h1>DOGE Claimed It Saved $8 Billion in One Contract. It Was Actually $8 Million.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><header><p id="article-summary">The biggest single line item on the website of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team appears to include an error.</p><p><time datetime="2025-02-18T20:17:25-05:00"><span>Feb. 18, 2025</span></time></p></header><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>The Department of Government Efficiency, the federal cost-cutting initiative championed by Elon Musk, published on Monday a list of government contracts it has canceled, together amounting to about $16 billion in savings itemized on a new “<a href="https://doge.gov/savings" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wall of receipts</a>” on its website.</p><p>Almost half of those line-item savings could be attributed to a single $8 billion contract for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But it appears that the DOGE list vastly overstated the actual intended value of that contract. A closer scrutiny of a federal database shows that a recent version of the contract was for $8 million, not $8 billion. A larger total savings number published on the site, $55 billion, lacked specific documentation.</p><p>The contract, with a company called D&amp;G Support Services, was to provide “program and technical support services” for the Office of Diversity and Civil Rights at ICE. The Trump administration has been purging diversity programs from the federal government.</p><p>By examining past versions of the contract listed on the <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/index.php/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Procurement Data System</a>, The Upshot determined that the federal award, approved in September 2022, had <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7012&amp;PIID=70CMSD22A00000008&amp;idvAgencyID=&amp;idvPIID=GS00F131DA&amp;contractType=IDV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initially listed</a> a total value of $8 billion. But on Jan. 22 this year, that <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7012&amp;PIID=70CMSD22A00000008&amp;modNumber=P00001&amp;idvAgencyID=&amp;idvPIID=GS00F131DA&amp;contractType=IDV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">figure was updated</a> to $8 million. According to the database, the contract was terminated about <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7012&amp;PIID=70CMSD22A00000008&amp;modNumber=P00003&amp;idvAgencyID=&amp;idvPIID=GS00F131DA&amp;contractType=IDV" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a week later</a>. (For context, $8 billion is nearly the size of the entire budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It’s possible that DOGE or someone else in the Trump administration can claim credit for fixing the error in the contracting database, given that the value was downgraded to $8 million two days after President Trump took office. But it is also clear that the government was not spending $8 billion on the contract. In the two and a half years since it was signed, <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_IDV_70CMSD22A00000008_7012" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2.5 million had been spent</a>; the contract appeared set to expire in 2027.</p><p>The DOGE website initially included a screenshot from the federal contracting database showing that the contract’s value was $8 million, even as the DOGE site listed $8 billion in savings. On Tuesday night, around the time this article was published, DOGE removed the screenshot that showed the mismatch, but continued to claim $8 billion in savings. It added a link to the original, outdated version of the contract worth $8 billion.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/upshot/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/upshot/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/upshot/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2-mobileMasterAt3x.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A screenshot of the DOGE website, showing $8 billion in savings against an $8 million contract." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/upshot/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/upshot/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/upshot/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2-jumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/18/upshot/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2/up--doge-receipts-screenshot-2-superJumbo.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c7248e64-d239-572b-bc4f-c94f07fa0c0d" decoding="async" width="600" height="432"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A screenshot of the DOGE website on Tuesday.
