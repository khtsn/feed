    <h1>Biden Is Pardoning Nearly 1,500 Americans, a Record for a U.S. President</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>President Biden is commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people, the largest grant of clemency by an American president in a single day, the White House announced in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>A large number of those being pardoned had been placed in home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, while 39 were serving sentences for nonviolent crimes, including possession of marijuana.</p><p>The announcement came two weeks after Mr. Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/biden-pardon-son-hunter.html" title="">issued a pardon for his son</a>, Hunter, who had been convicted of gun possession and income tax evasion. That decision was harshly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats because Mr. Biden had long ruled out clemency for his son.</p><p>The White House said that the commutations announced on Thursday represented Mr. Biden’s commitment to “help reunite families, strengthen communities, and reintegrate individuals back into society.”</p></div></div>
