</span> on Sunday.</p>

<p>The EMEA champions put up a levels-to-this performance in their first match against a North American team this year, dropping just 14 rounds in both maps, undeterred by whatever G2 tried to put in their paths.</p>

<p>On Haven, the most dominant of the two maps, <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/9810/alfajer">
		Alfajer	</a>
</span> delivered a 2.02 rating — a rare sight in international Valorant — and 24 kills in just 16 rounds. His ADR approached 300 and his mere seven deaths allowed for a 94% KAST on Iso.</p>

<p>“They nerfed Iso, but they didn&#39;t nerf me. I&#39;m still good,” Alfajer said.</p>

<p>After that soul-crushing performance from Alfajer allowed his team to reach a 13-3 win on their Haven pick, the match segued to Bind. G2 put a much better performance on their own pick, though, and nearly pushed FNATIC to overtime.</p>

<p>The map seemed to go the same way Haven did for the first half, as FNATIC took a comfortable 8-4 lead. G2 would not back down as easily, and broke FNATIC&#39;s economy as they reached an 8-8 tie. The match remained incredibly tight from thereon out until the final round of regulation, when <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/458/chronicle">
		Chronicle	</a>
</span> put up the highlight of the match.</p>

<p>With just one chance to close out the game at 12-11, Chronicle and <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/438/boaster">
		Boaster	</a>
</span> prepared for a 2v4 A defuse while most of G2 sat in showers. Boaster got a kill and as he stuck the defuse, G2&#39;s remaining three pushed out through the Cosmic Divide with a myriad of flashes, ignoring Chronicle as he blindly sprayed down all of G2 to find victory.</p>

<p>Alfajer was a little cooler on Bind, averaging a 1.08 rating. The larger numbers went to his teammates Derke and Chronicle, at 1.25 and 1.36 respectively. The latter also found five opening kills in a total of 24, 17 of which on attack, making the difference in FNATIC&#39;s first half.</p>


<p><em>The definition of spray and pray.</em></p>

<p>This victory over G2 is a lifeline for FNATIC, after a sketchy 2-0 loss against <span data-ref-id="7">

</span> in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/391367/team-heretics-continue-winstreak-with-2-0-over-fnatic" target="_blank">upper bracket opener</a>. That loss threw FNATIC into the lower bracket, a place they have never recovered from ever since their <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/353/valorant-champions-tour-stage-2-masters-reykjav-k" target="_blank">Masters Reykjavik 2021</a> run.</p>

<p>“We had a long discussion last night. At least an hour, probably a bit longer, just talking about how we performed because yesterday wasn&#39;t good,” <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/19729/elmapuddy">
		Elmapuddy	</a>
</span> told the analyst desk. “It was just ‘have a win Heretics,&#39; basically, except for the second half of Abyss.”</p>

<p>The FNATIC that entered the server today looked rejuvenated in a way they have not been in a long time. Their Haven was a show of unparalleled dominance and, after closing out a drawn-out Bind, FNATIC&#39;s confidence is certainly unbridled going into their next lower bracket match.</p>

<p>“It&#39;s just the energy. If we have the right energy on the right days, I think we&#39;re really hard to stop. You saw in EMEA, we just steamrolled everyone,” Elmapuddy said. “The boys stepped up, people are fragging, they&#39;re talking, they have good energy.”</p>

<p>Historically, lower brackets have not treated FNATIC well. Most recently, at <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/1999/champions-tour-2024-masters-shanghai" target="_blank">Masters Shanghai</a>, they were eliminated without a win to their name. They have surpassed that hurdle now, but Champions will keep FNATIC up against the ropes until they are either knocked out or get their hands lifted.</p>

<p>“I told the boys if we can get over [G2], they&#39;re a really good team, we can beat anyone else that&#39;s left. We just have to keep the energy and keep going,” Elmapuddy said.</p>
