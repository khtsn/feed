The other is a former high-school football coach and National Guardsman who speaks openly about his infertility journey, supports gay rights and was responsible for bringing free period products into Minnesota’s public schools — which resulted in him being cast as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/walz-free-tampons-schools-minnesota.html" title="">Tampon Tim</a>.”</p><p>These men have little in common, and only one of them is running for vice president. But taken together, Taylor Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce and Kamala Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz, exemplify a kind of healthy masculine confidence we seem to have all but forgotten after eight long years of Donald Trump (and five long weeks of JD Vance). These guys don’t seem self-conscious about wearing their emotions on their sleeves, or in showing devotion and appreciation to the women they often stand behind. And yet it doesn’t feel like they are posturing — either by virtue signaling or doling out sensitive-guy breadcrumbs in order to earn clout.</p><p>What Mr. Walz and Mr. Kelce do share is an elusive quality of masculine identity that bears a clever name: Jock Insurance. It means, in a nutshell, that they possess the masculine bona fides — things like football, hunting, military service — that allow them to behave in ways that seem at odds with traditional masculinity, without being seen as weak.</p><p>Jock Insurance was coined by the sociologist C.J. Pascoe in the early 2000s after she spent a year interviewing teenage boys at two public high schools in Northern California. At the time, she told me, there were a series of unspoken rules these boys abided by in order to keep the social hierarchy intact and ensure they were deemed appropriately masculine. In those days, the worst thing a teenage boy of any sexual identity could be called was a “fag” — and Dr. Pascoe’s subjects frequently detailed the behaviors, from being in the drama club to smiling too much, that might put them at risk of being labeled.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Except there was a caveat: the jocks. At each school she studied, Dr. Pascoe said, there were a handful of jocks who had somehow freed themselves of those rules and expectations. These boys — football players, often — talked tenderly about their feelings and were at ease describing the closeness of their male friendships and how much they loved their families. And they were seemingly unashamed to do so — all while other boys bent over backward to avoid anything of the sort.</p><p>“I was just like, ‘How do you get away with that?’ ” Dr. Pascoe told me. It was then that the equation began to add up. By virtue of their status as athletes, she theorized, these guys had stockpiled enough masculine capital — in effect, dude cred — to take emotional risks. For those willing to take those risks, sometimes the payoff was everything: It allowed them to be themselves.</p><p>Dr. Pascoe published her findings in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764203046010009" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> and then a <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/dude-youre-a-fag/paper" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a>, “Dude, You’re a Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School,” and I called her this week because it occurred to me that Mr. Walz and Mr. Kelce possessed these masculine characteristics, too. What was it about their easygoing, sensitive-dude vibes, combined with their masculine-coded exteriors, that made them so damn appealing?</p><p>For Mr. Walz in particular, the worship happened fast. Almost from the moment Ms. Harris announced him as her running mate, he became <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/tim-walz-dad-memes/679393/?utm_campaign=galaxy-brain&amp;utm_content=20240807&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=Galaxy+Brain+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2024%2F08%2Ftim-walz-dad-memes%2F679393%2F%3Futm_campaign%3Dgalaxy-brain&amp;utm_content=20240807&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=Galaxy+Brain" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the internet’s favorite father figure</a>: a salt-of-the-earth, Ted Lasso kind of man who sees no contradiction between his love of stereotypically straight-guy stuff like hunting and sports and being the honorary straight guy to head up the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/tim-walz-gay-students.html" title="">first-ever gay-straight alliance</a> at the high school where he taught.</p><p>To the contrary, those things worked to make Mr. Walz even more charming: He was, as some on social media put it, the kind of guy who’d let you <a href="https://www.threads.net/@erinobrien007/post/C-VWbuEuYbv?xmt=AQGz7d-9SSkvOPx3Tdc40-YX5aAKm-sNhzKWimKvYQ7w1w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">borrow his power washer</a>; the neighbor who would teach you how to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@laura_brianna/post/C-VT4GsOTpz?xmt=AQGz7d-9SSkvOPx3Tdc40-YX5aAKm-sNhzKWimKvYQ7w1w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put up shelves in your</a> office; the coach who’d slip you a $20 bill on your way out the door because “<a href="https://www.threads.net/@zach.l.j/post/C-VYdHwxCml?xmt=AQGz7d-9SSkvOPx3Tdc40-YX5aAKm-sNhzKWimKvYQ7w1w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">you never know if some place doesn’t take credit cards</a>,” long after you’d had children of your own. “He just exudes a kind of everyday masculinity that I think feels comforting,” Dr. Pascoe said. “But at the same time, because he’s got these masculine competencies, he can thread this needle that so many guys can’t.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Is this a new era of “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/tim-walz-doug-emhoff-democrats-nice-men-of-the-left.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">positive masculinity</a>”? I wondered. Is it an antidote to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/toxic-masculinity.html" title="">toxic</a>,” which some have taken to calling “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/08/08/tim-walz-midwestern-dad/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tonic</a>”? Is this <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a61837292/tim-walz-memes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a manliness of fun</a>? Or are big, sweet beefy guys <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/05/hunks-celebrity-glen-powell-jeremy-allen-white" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simply having a moment</a>?</p><p>Whichever it is, it seems like some modicum of progress, or at least an interesting new way of understanding these guys’ appeal. It’s as if somebody had cherry-picked the most obvious attributes of how Americans <em>think</em> men are supposed to be — “I guarantee you he can’t shoot pheasants like I can,” Mr. Walz <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4803004-walz-vance-shooting-skills-second-amendment/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said of Mr. Vance</a> in a recent interview on CNN — and sprinkled them with something a little <a href="https://www.today.com/news/sports/caleb-williams-painted-nails-rcna149473" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more flexible</a>.</p><p>That flexibility might take the form of 250-pound siblings and <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/09/01/kelce-brothers-on-growing-up-together-winning-super-bowls-daily-cover" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beasts of the football field</a> saying “I love you” to each other and crying openly — not just about football, but about love — demonstrating that emotion is nothing to be ashamed of. It might play out by simply admitting fault or changing a perspective, as Mr. Walz has done with his position on guns. It could even look like Ms. Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, once a successful entertainment lawyer, who quit his job to enthusiastically take on the role of his wife’s head cheerleader, posing with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-p64c3JOeE/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cardboard cutouts of Ms. Harris</a>, flashing goobery thumbs-ups, even speaking the words “Pap smear” on the stump.</p><p>“I think both Tim and Doug have that kind of effortlessly masculine quality that, like the Kelce brothers, allows them to break the rules of manhood,” said Tristan Bridges, a sociologist who coedits the academic journal Men and Masculinities. Mr. Bridges added that they may be among the rare group for whom doing something that would otherwise be deemed emasculating — like, say, handing out tampons, or singing every word to his girlfriend’s pop songs — is in fact even more masculinizing. “It has this effect of, like, oh my gosh, and he doesn’t even care.”</p><p>Discussion of masculinity doesn’t exist without comparison, and it’s the comparison that makes any of this worth noting. It’s in contrast with Mr. Trump and his testosterone-filled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/arts/television/donald-trump-rnc.html" title="">Hulkamania</a> of a Republican National Convention. In contrast with Mr. Trump’s followers, some of whom apparently think “<a href="https://x.com/GuntherEagleman/status/1821868032978722986" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dudes who vote for Kamala Harris pee sitting down</a>.” In contrast with Mr. Vance, who has called childless Americans “deranged” and “sociopathic,” referred to women as “cat ladies” and whose fans are apparently carrying around <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/18/republicans-jd-vance-carry-fake-cups-semen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cups of fake sperm</a> to emphasize his supposed virility. Even in contrast with President Biden, who, for all his talk of honor and empathy and love of country, has at times succumbed to challenges of a push-up contest or saying that if he and Mr. Trump were in high school, he’d take Mr. Trump “behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>It’s rare to find a man, political candidate or otherwise, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/us/politics/trump-biden-masculinity-2020.html" title="">who hasn’t engaged in this kind of masculine posturing,</a> at least somewhat. For better or for worse, it has been both historically ingrained and also seemingly necessary. Whether it’s battling over who would be the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/gender-identity/when-did-we-decide-the-best-presidential-candidate-is-the-one-youd-want-to-have-a-beer-with/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">better guy to have a beer with</a> or rolling up their shirtsleeves on the campaign trail (typically in a rural area, typically with locals present) for a well-suited photo op, Democrats in particular have long labored over how to reach male voters who tend to value more traditional attributes of masculinity.</p><p>The fact that Mr. Trump’s win in 2016 was fueled in part by those who <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/prri-atlantic-poll-republican-democratic-primary-trump-supporters/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feared</a> society was becoming too soft and feminine doesn’t bode particularly well for eradicating such attempts at alpha maleness. After all, we know that when men feel like their masculinity is under threat — whether real or imagined — they tend to lean in to things they perceive will make up for that threat: buying guns or <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15365042231172460" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto</a>, or s<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/668417?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upporting aggressive foreign policy</a>. In one 2016 study from the political scientist Dan Cassino, just the mere mention of women as breadwinners caused some men to <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1177%2F1536504218766551&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cdcassino%40fdu.edu%7Caf96c13fd9ed47a960ba08d87eb4038e%7C3224fad94bcc4d47ae9886ea3c6b3b13%7C1%7C0%7C637398659692132324%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&amp;sdata=OE5mmBV%2FDfNr6R0PwD8s7kha56uFFNfhHsvJQmKgb7A%3D&amp;reserved=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drop their support for Hillary Clinton.</a></p><p>Watching Mr. Walz deftly play No. 2 to Ms. Harris, and imagining how unabashed he might continue to be if they win, I started to feel something strange: hope. Hope that someday, the way we perceive political candidates’ genders could look a little more <em>expansive</em> than, say, Mr. Vance. In the meantime, perhaps our aspiration should be that manning the grill or singing in the drama club or heading the gay-straight alliance are all valid forms of being a man, or a politician or a male politician who is supporting a woman who is running to be president.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jessica Bennett is a contributing editor in the Opinion section of The Times.
