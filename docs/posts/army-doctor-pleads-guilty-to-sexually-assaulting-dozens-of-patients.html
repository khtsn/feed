Michael Stockin, who is currently serving at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State, was accused of touching or viewing the genitals of 41 of his male patients under the guise of medical treatment between 2019 and 2022, according to court documents.</p><p>At a hearing on Tuesday, he admitted to 36 counts of abusive sexual contact and five of indecent viewing, according to Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Office of Special Trial Counsel.</p><p>The plea agreement is subject to acceptance by a military judge, who will determine whether there is enough evidence to support the plea during hearings this week. If the plea is accepted, Major Stockin faces up to 13½ years in prison, according to Ryan Guilds, a lawyer representing some of the victims.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Guilds said the plea was “an important step in the pursuit of justice.” He said the victims had chosen to come forward “despite the guilt and shame that often accompany being a victim of sexual assault, especially for male soldiers in our Army.”</p><p>Sexual assault by men against men is a widespread problem in the U.S. military, with many cases going unreported as a result of stigma and fear of retaliation, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-15-284.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to a government report on sexual assaults of male service personnel.</p><p>Women in the military face significantly higher rates of sexual assault than men. However, because men vastly outnumber women in the ranks, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/10/us/men-military-sexual-assault.html" title="">total number</a> of male and female victims in recent years has been roughly equal.</p><p>Major Stockin has served as an anesthesiologist in the Army since 2013. He was assigned in July of 2019 to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where he worked at Madigan Army Medical Center.</p><p>In February 2022, the Army started an investigation into a number of allegations of sexual misconduct against Major Stockin, leading to his suspension from patient care, according to Ms. McCaskill. He continued to work at the medical center and was reassigned to administrative duties.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In August 2023, Major Stockin was formally charged in a case involving 23 victims. By the start of the following year, the number of victims involved in the case had risen to 41, Ms. McCaskill said.</p><p>A lawyer for Major Stockin did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In addition to the criminal case, more than 20 administrative complaints have been <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/18/2999210/0/en/Four-Additional-Victims-of-Army-Doc-Michael-Stockin-File-Federal-Tort-Claims-Act-Administrative-Complaints-Against-the-Army-and-Department-of-Defense.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed</a> on behalf of victims against the Army and the Department of Defense, accusing the military of failing to adequately protect patients who were under Major Stockin’s care.</p><p>Christine Dunn, a lawyer representing the victims in the complaints, said that many of their lives had been derailed by the abuse, leaving them with intense anxiety. Some now avoid medical attention, fearing another assault, she said.</p><p>“The reason they sought treatment in the first place was because they were suffering from chronic, debilitating pain and needed medical care,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking that they are now declining medical attention because of what happened to them.”</p><p>One of the complaints stated: “I struggle daily with feelings of shame, worthlessness, and anger. The military was my life and my identity. Now, I feel like a stranger to myself and to those I love.”</p><p>Bryce Dubee, an Army spokesman, said in a statement that the Army would not comment on the pending complaints because they were the subject of potential litigation.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
