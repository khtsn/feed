</span> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542211/g2-esports-vs-team-heretics-valorant-champions-2025-opening-d" target="_blank">2-0 in Group D</a>, reminding its opponents just why a fourth seed designation is a bit disingenuous for one of EMEA&#39;s best.</p>

<p>Team Heretics received the first map pick, choosing Corrode, while G2 selected the defense side first. G2 decided to run double Sentinel without a Viper, while Heretics ran double Controller with Astra and Viper. <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/18350/miniboo">

</span> quickly got some Sheriff kills to win the first pistol, but G2 held strong with classics to win the eco. For a very attack-sided map, G2 swapped its composition again to get a stronger defense side, and it paid off with <span data-ref-id="3">

<p><em>leaf gets three kills holding backsite on A against Team Heretics.</em></p>

<p>Heretics won the second pistol and the bonus to erase the deficit. The attack side already looked worrying for G2, with the pushes either dying in seconds or losing to time. When <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3993/jawgemo">
		jawgemo	</a>
</span>&#39;s Raze ulted himself and died soon after, the map was effectively over. It took until round 21 for G2 to win its first attack round, and while Heretics did give some hope to G2 at the end, Heretics cleaned it up 13-11 and took the series lead. </p>

<p>Now, G2 had to win on Lotus, a strong map regionally and a completely different story from its known struggles on Corrode. The compositions changed for both teams, with Heretics running Chamber and Deadlock while G2 ran Tejo and Fade. G2 got its first pistol win of the series thanks to jawgemo on Yoru, and converted the bonus. That momentum built fast, as it took a <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/21328/wo0t">
		Wo0t	</a>
</span> 2v4 clutch with a Chamber ult to get Heretics its first round win. That clutch from Wo0t did allow for a good recovery from a 6-0 deficit, as G2 ended the half up only 7-5.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O151lw_uPxQ?si=Sy0VgyHS14gGN17B&amp;clip=UgkxZbO-2x3dqYdYrytVOsl2IIO_S7v2aqvX&amp;clipt=EIXi0gkYndfTCQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/10971/riens">
		RieNs	</a>
</span> gets three to clutch a round and save a half for Heretics.</em></p>

<p>Heretics won the second pistol, meaning that the team quickly tied the game and once again put the ball in G2&#39;s court: to attack better than they did on Corrode. Even as G2 forced a signature Stinger buy, Wo0t once again clutched on B site. Just like that, from down 6-0, G2 was down 8-7 early in the second half. A big thrifty from <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/3885/valyn">
		valyn	</a>
</span> stopped a complete collapse, as jawgemo soon after won a big 1v1 to tie the game at 9-9. Rounds were traded, but G2 fumbled a 4v2 post-plant on C site, and the economy was in shambles. Wo0t landed unbelievable shots to close the map 13-10 and sweep G2 2-0. </p>

<p>In both maps, G2 had advantages that were tossed away, from the composition choice on Corrode to the lost clutches on Lotus. Even then, the Heretics shown in the first game at Champs looked nothing like the regional Heretics who failed to win a map in the EMEA Stage 2 playoffs, and that was thanks to RieNs. He ended the series with a 1.32 match rating, 41 kills, 85% KAST, and an outstanding Fade across both maps.</p>
