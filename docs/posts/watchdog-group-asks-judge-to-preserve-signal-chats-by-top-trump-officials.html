Boasberg, who is overseeing the case, would cover any Signal messages about official business sent by or received from Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Ratcliffe, along with Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence; Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary; and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>Late last month, Judge Boasberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/signal-chat-houthis-court-decision.html" title="">ordered all of the officials to preserve the messages on the initial Signal chat</a>, known as the “Houthi PC Small Group Chat.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.
