Helene was closing in and, for the first time, he wasn’t sure he could stay.</p><p>Across Florida’s Big Bend region, which has already endured two other hurricanes in 13 months, many more people appeared to be heeding evacuation orders this time, leaving the small towns that dot the coast eerily empty on Thursday.</p><p>That was especially true in three rural counties that had taken the rare step of ordering mandatory countywide evacuations. Homes and businesses in Wakulla County, where Panacea is, were boarded up. In Crawfordville, even the local Waffle House was covered with plywood.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The streets of Carrabelle, a waterfront city with a population of about 2,600 in neighboring Franklin County, appeared mostly deserted. In Taylor County, the sheriff’s office asked residents staying home to email local officials so that they could track who might need rescuing after the storm.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dekle Beach, a small coastal community, is mostly empty before Hurricane Helene makes landfall.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A sign warned motorists outside Tallahassee, Fla., of the hurricane warning in effect Wednesday night.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paul Ratje for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Florida National Guard arrived on Thursday morning in Cedar Key, a tiny city that sits on a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico, to alert the remaining residents about the approaching danger.</p><p>“In the last storm here, people would walk by us with beer and we’d say, ‘There’s a hurricane here,’” Capt. John Meacham said. “They’d say, ‘We’ll stick it out.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>He noticed fewer such people on Thursday.</p><p>John MacDonald, the director of emergency management for Levy County, which includes Cedar Key, said he had hoped to see more residents in emergency shelters. “But I know some people seek shelter with family or somewhere else,” he added.</p><p>Capt. Jeff Yarbrough, a spokesman for the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office, said deputies had been thorough in going door to door beginning on Wednesday to urge people to get out, especially if they live south of U.S. 98, which runs parallel to the Gulf Coast.</p><p>“The conditions for our county are pretty severe, more so than we’ve had in recent memory,” he said. Perhaps 200 people whom deputies had contacted in the county of about 35,000 said they planned to stay, he estimated early on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>To the southeast in Steinhatchee, a fishing town of a few hundred people, Tyler Rayborn, 31, bluntly summarized the feel of the place as he worked with a friend to anchor down the sign for his family’s hardware store: “It’s dead. Town’s dead.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tyler Rayborn, 31, bluntly summarized the feel of  Steinhatchee, a fishing town of a few hundred people, as he worked with a friend to anchor down the sign for his family’s hardware store: “It’s dead.

He said he would stay at his home, a short drive inland, before heading back to reopen as soon as possible so people could get supplies.</p><p>Many who own homes in the small community are relatively new to the state, he said, and spooked by the threat of the storm.</p><p>“Us, born and raised, we just stay here,” said Mr. Rayborn, who had a University of Florida alligator tattoo and an elaborate artistic sketch of the state visible on his left arm. “There’s nowhere for us to go.”</p><p>A little bit further north, near Keaton Beach, Donna and Greg Staab sat on their porch on Thursday morning enjoying a cool breeze. They planned to head for a neighbor’s homemade bunker in the afternoon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We’re just hoping for the best, that’s all you can do at this point,” Ms. Staab said. “Just stay and pray.”</p><p>Further south, near Tampa Bay, which is far from Hurricane Helene’s winds but was already experiencing storm surge on Thursday, some residents accustomed to street flooding said they would stay.</p><p>Joe and Steph Powless rode bicycles to the beach in Gulfport, west of St. Petersburg, to check on conditions.</p><p>“It’s just so common,” Mr. Powless said as waters inundated the streets. The couple lives in a low-lying area under a mandatory evacuation order but were staying put, they said, along with most of their neighbors.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gina Ryals, measures the rising floodwaters outside of her home in the Twin Cities mobile home park in St. Petersburg, Fla.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A man wades through floodwaters, his pants rolled above the knee, carrying a Trader Joe’s shopping bag.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicole Craine for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In asking people to evacuate, emergency managers repeatedly reminded residents that they did not need to go too far from home — likely just a few miles inland, away from the deadly storm surge, which is expected to reach up to 20 feet high in parts of northern Florida.</p><p>Cole Hall, a 25-year-old oyster farmer from Oyster Bay, decided to stay with family about 10 miles north of Panacea.</p><p>“We got oysters. We got beer. We got generators. We got pretty much everything we need,” he said. “We got gator on the grill right now.”</p><p>On Thursday, he was busy sinking the cages that house his growing oyster crop to the bottom of the bay in an effort to protect the seeds from possible storm surge.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>His biggest fear is losing his farm, he said. “My next year’s product could potentially be lost, and I wouldn’t have anything for next year to sell.”</p><p>In Panacea, Mr. Posey, the restaurant owner, was assessing his situation as he looked out over the miserable, steady rain that fell most of the day.</p><p>“I’d be crabbing in this,” said Mr. Posey, who is also a commercial fisherman. He remembered past storms: “During Dennis, I was rescuing people with an aluminum boat.”</p><p>But he worried that strong winds could rip off roofs. And he’s older now, he said — a grandfather looking to stay safe.</p><p>Mr. Posey said he would wait for the water to get to the door of his restaurant.</p><p>Then, he might go.</p><p>Valerie Crowder<!-- -->, <!-- -->Jacey Fortin<!-- -->, <!-- -->Rachel Nostrant<!-- -->, <!-- -->Kate Selig<!-- --> and <!-- -->Isabelle Taft<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Patricia Mazzei is the lead reporter for The Times in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico.<span> </span></p></div><div><p>Emily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-cochrane">More about Emily Cochrane</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>21</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Even Hurricane Veterans Desert Florida’s Big Bend<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
