Amtrak initially expected the development to cost $6 billion, but now estimates it could cost as much as $8.5 billion.</p><p>As part of the talks, officials with the Department of Transportation, which oversees the Federal Railroad Administration, met with employees from the Boring Company last month and were told that the firm could find ways to build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions.</p><p>A Transportation Department spokesman, Nathaniel Sizemore, confirmed that the Boring Company was one of several firms being consulted for the purposes of awarding a new engineering contract.

Mr. Musk leads or owns at least six companies, including the electric automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.
