It was an energetic and catchy rap ballad — one that, these days, is instantly recognizable on the streets of Mozambique.</p><p>“Povo no Poder! Povo no Poder!” the men sang along, repeating a refrain that also was emblazoned on the black T-shirts they wore in Marracuene, a town about an hour outside of Maputo, Mozambique’s capital.</p><p>“People in Power,” as the song’s title translates in English, has become the unofficial anthem of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/africa/mozambique-unrest-news.html" title="">a mass uprising</a> that has consumed this southern African nation over the past few months, with the phrase showing up on protest placards, in chants and on clothing.</p><p>Tens of thousands of Mozambicans have taken to the streets to reject a presidential election that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/world/africa/mozambique-disputed-election-results-upheld-chapo.html" title="">they believe was rigged</a> by the long-governing party, Frelimo. Daniel Chapo of Frelimo was declared the winner with 65 percent of the vote, but protesters denounced the result as fraudulent. Many have rallied behind the top opposition candidate, Venâncio Mondlane.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Chaotic demonstrations have descended into looting, vandalism and tires burning in the road. More than 250 deaths have been reported as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/world/africa/mozambique-protests-election.html" title="">the police and military have clashed with protesters</a>.</p><p>Yet, Mozambicans continue to protest in the streets en masse, with many of them — particularly young people — turning to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhSKixT-n0w" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Povo no Poder,</a>” the prescient song by the rap star Azagaia, as a guiding light.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Born Edson Amândio Maria Lopes da Luz, Azagaia stood out for lyrics that bluntly criticized the government — a risky move in a nation where the state has been known to crush the slightest whiff of dissent. (His music has been censored on state media.) That fearlessness is what inspires many to push through the danger and chaos of the current upheaval, activists say.</p><p>After Azagaia died last year following an epileptic seizure at age 38, young people flocked to the streets to pay tribute to him. Those tributes turned into processions in which the youth aired their grievances — and were eventually <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/mozambique-a-rappers-death-sparked-youth-led-protests/a-65178273" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">squashed by police tear gas</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Cídia Chissungo, 28, a rights activist who organized some of the marches, said the anger over that experience has in part fueled young people now protesting the election results. In some ways, Ms. Chissungo said, Azagaia wrote the playbook for the youth uprising, with lyrics speaking to the very issues that have stirred public anger.</p><p>In “<a href="https://www.letras.mus.br/azagaia/1284810/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The March</a>,” he rapped about how the poor are overlooked by the political elite.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.letras.mus.br/azagaia/ai-de-nos-part-amen-hill-amelia-charlton-e-dalton-simao-clemente/#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Woe to Us</a>” criticizes the government’s failure to help the people of the oil-rich northern province of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/africa/100000007760967/mozambique-attack.html" title="">Cabo Delgado</a>, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/world/africa/isis-mozambique-attack.html" title="">upended by an Islamic State-backed insurgency</a> for several years.</p><p>And “<a href="https://www.letras.mus.br/azagaia/vendem-o-pais-part-helena-rosa-e-tj/#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sell the Country</a>” castigates the government for selling out the country to oil and gas interests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/world/africa/31mozambique-song-video-promo/maputo-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Venâncio Mondlane, the top opposition candidate, leading supporters in a chant of “Povo no Poder” in Maputo, Mozambique, in October last year.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But no song has captured the imagination like “Povo no Poder,” which he released in 2008 amid huge protests over rising costs of food and public transportation. Although that was 16 years ago, it was almost as if Azagaia had predicted how the situation would play out in Mozambique today.</p><p>In the song, which he raps in Portuguese, he says:</p><blockquote><p><em>This government really won’t change, no</em></p><p><em>There will be a tragedy, yes</em></p><p><em>Even if they come with tear gas</em></p><p><em>The strike is full of oxygen</em></p><p><em>They won’t stop our performance</em></p><p><em>I will fight, I won’t abstain.</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/multimedia/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/multimedia/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/multimedia/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A crowd carrying large banners and smaller signs march through the street." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/multimedia/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/multimedia/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/multimedia/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/31/multimedia/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw/31mozambique-song-1-qcjw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/979f3f37-aebc-527f-b9cf-afa070322452" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Supporters of Mr. Mondlane demonstrating in Maputo last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Alfredo Zuniga/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Eligon is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The Times, covering a wide range of events and trends that influence and shape the lives of ordinary people across southern Africa.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon">More about John Eligon</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore the World of Hip-Hop</h2><hr/><ul><li><p>Self-empowerment rhymes catapulted GloRilla onto rap’s A-list.
