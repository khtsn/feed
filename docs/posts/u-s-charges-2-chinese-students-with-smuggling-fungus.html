The fungus can be particularly damaging to winter wheat crops.</p><p>Ms. Jian was arrested and booked in the federal courthouse in Detroit; Mr. Liu is believed to be in China. The criminal charges come as tensions mount between the United States and China over the Trump administration’s vow to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/china-student-visas-revoke.html" title="">“aggressively” revoke student visas</a> for Chinese nationals. Such students, the administration says, risk siphoning off sensitive technology or trade secrets from American labs for the benefit of their home country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Jerome F. Gorgon Jr., the interim U.S. attorney in Detroit, said the researchers’ actions amounted to “the gravest national security concerns,” saying they had tried to bring “a potential agroterrorism weapon” into “the heartland of America.”</p><p>For decades, U.S. national security officials have worried about — and sometimes arrested — Chinese academics suspected of stealing scientific data from American universities and businesses. The Trump administration’s new push goes further by stripping an unspecified number of students of visas.</p><p>Some experts say such a heavy-handed approach is likely to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/us/politics/trump-china-student-visas-crackdown-risks.html" title="">cause more harm than good</a> to U.S. scientific advances, by preventing or dissuading some of the roughly 277,000 Chinese students who arrive in the United States each year to advance their studies.</p><p>The new case is distinct from most past national security cases related to Chinese students. Ms. Jian and Mr. Liu are accused not of taking material out of the United States, but of bringing it in. And charging papers specifically cite Ms. Jian’s written pledge of loyalty to the Communist Chinese Party.</p><p>When a customs agent at Detroit Metropolitan Airport found the baggies last summer, Mr. Liu at first denied they were his but eventually admitted to smuggling them so that he could conduct research on it at the University of Michigan laboratory where Ms. Jian worked, according to a criminal complaint filed against the pair.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Liu stated that, while he was in the United States, he would have free access to the laboratory at the University of Michigan on some days, and that other days his girlfriend would give him access to the laboratory to conduct his research,” the complaint states.</p><p>The complaint also offers evidence of an earlier instance in which the pair may have smuggled material into the United States. Messages exchanged between Ms. Jian and Mr. Liu indicate she may have successfully hidden material in her shoe on a 2022 trip, the complaint said. Other messages cited in the complaint suggest that in early 2024, Ms. Jian arranged for another associate in China to mail a book with a plastic baggie hidden inside.</p><p>The complaint said Ms. Jian’s cellphone also contained a work assessment form she had signed in January 2024 related to her research at a Chinese university. The form consisted of a pledge to remain loyal to China and to “support the leadership of the Communist Party of China, resolutely implement the party’s educational guidelines and policies, love education, care for students, unite colleagues, love the motherland and care about international affairs,” according to the criminal complaint.</p><p>Ms. Jian and Mr. Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, false statements and visa fraud.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Devlin Barrett covers the Justice Department and the F.B.I. for The Times.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
