Rives, which is northeast of Memphis, has a population about 300.</p><p>Kentucky was hit particularly hard, with intense rain and wind gusts of up to 60 miles per hour, the National Weather Service said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>At one point early on Sunday, flood warnings were in place for all 120 counties in Kentucky. Parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia were also under flood warnings on Sunday morning, according to the Weather Service.</p><p>Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GovAndyBeshear/posts/pfbid0pPtrnGLyV4mbxt6TcsCC2XUWWkHKtbTMhjm6UxUWGg4TVjDJq2Ktn5hferAuotUcl" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> on Sunday that there were more than 300 road closures across the state and that conditions were still dangerous after the storm caused mudslides in the east and snow in the west.</p><p>He said there had been hundreds of water rescues and that widespread flooding continued on Sunday.</p><p>Mr. Beshear said that President Trump had approved his request for an emergency disaster declaration, which makes federal funding available to help the state recover.</p><p>At least three people died in Kentucky on Saturday during the storms, including a woman and her 7-year-old child in Bonnieville, an unincorporated area in Hart County about 66 miles south of Louisville.

Scott Powell of the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department told reporters. </p><p>In Virginia, flash floods were reported in the southwestern portion of the state, Gov. Glenn Youngkin <a href="https://x.com/GovernorVA/status/1890834061670617438" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Saturday.

As a result, wind advisories were issued along the East Coast for Sunday, from northern Florida to the Northeast.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The storms are going to continue to advance east,” said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Service. “And with that there will be the potential for additional heavy rains and severe weather, including severe thunderstorms and perhaps a tornado or two.”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Judson Jones<!-- -->, <!-- -->Isabella Kwai<!-- -->, <!-- -->Adeel Hassan<!-- -->, <!-- -->Nazaneen Ghaffar<!-- --> , <!-- -->Amanda Holpuch<!-- -->, <!-- -->Austyn Gaffney<!-- --> and <!-- -->Johnny Diaz<!-- -->.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
