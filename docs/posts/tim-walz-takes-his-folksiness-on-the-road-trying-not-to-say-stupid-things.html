Trump. But Mr. Walz had also, twice, expressed support for getting rid of the Electoral College, the system of presidential vote apportionment laid out in the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>This opinion did not reflect the official position of the Harris-Walz campaign, a Walz spokesman was quick to clarify in the ensuing kerfuffle. But, more broadly, it did reflect the gamble that Vice President Kamala Harris made in choosing Mr. Walz as her running mate: that his unscripted, freewheeling rhetorical style might break some china but might also endear him to the American electorate.</p><p>“I have a habit of speaking before I think on some things,” Mr. Walz told an audience of donors in Nevada later on Tuesday afternoon at a private home set in the lush, rolling ranch lands outside Reno.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Nine weeks ago, I was sitting in my house, minding my own damn business,” he said, to a wave of laughter. “And now I’m here, trying to do my best, at times saying stupid things,” he added, to more laughter. “But I’m trying to make the point: We so deeply believe in this country.”</p><p>Mr. Walz made that point of almost breathless optimism, in discursive speeches that defied punctuation, at every stop he made across the Southwest this week, as he pressed the ticket’s case in the critical battleground states of Nevada and Arizona.</p><p>He also calibrated his remarks to each audience, elaborating on policy proposals and talking points with neighborly riffs and knowing jokes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Walz addressed veterans and military families at a VFW hall named for Sen. John McCain, who died in 2018. His son Jim McCain, holding the microphone, has endorsed Kamala Harris for president.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick Breen/The Republic, via USA Today Network</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Walz has a tendency to speak his mind — and a penchant for exaggeration, if not outright fabrication. But he also has a knack for speaking to people candidly and directly, telling them what he intuits they want to hear.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After all, a group of donors in a deep-blue state like California may well want to know that Mr. Walz thinks their votes should matter as much as their checkbooks. And a group of tribal leaders in Arizona might be relieved to hear that Mr. Walz can speak naturally not only of their sovereignty but of a long “history of pain” between white Americans and Native Americans. And the guy in a Minnesota Twins cap in a high school gym in Tucson might be tickled to hear Mr. Walz thank him for the show of solidarity.</p><p>No doubt to the relief of campaign officials, there was no mention of the Electoral College at the ranch outside Reno. Once the reception ended, Mr. Walz left in his motorcade, a thin ribbon of cars unfurling onto the highway.</p><p>The fund-raising portion of his trip was over. Over the next 30 hours, he would sit for three television and radio interviews, travel more than 800 miles by plane and car, and speak before thousands of prospective voters.</p><p>At the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, a few thousand people were packed into a ballroom. There Mr. Walz spoke about Ms. Harris’s plans to lower housing costs, support young families and — a new proposal — expand Medicare to home health care providers and support the “sandwich generation” who are caring for children and aging parents.</p><p>He addressed Ms. Harris’s plan to address rising prices, and the administration’s cap on the price of insulin. “Here’s the deal about price gouging,” Mr. Walz said. “Businesses have the right to make money. We’re capitalists. We know how that works. But it’s gotta be fair, it’s gotta be moral.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>He scoffed at claims by the former president and Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance, that they want to support women. He also pledged to protect the Second Amendment.</p><p>The audience was friendly. Mr. Walz closed to a roar of applause and returned to the motorcade. </p><p>The next morning, the first day of early voting in Arizona, Mr. Walz was due in Chandler, about 30 minutes southeast of Phoenix. But first, there was an unannounced stop: breakfast at a popular Phoenix restaurant, Otro Cafe, where he met up with Doug Emhoff, Ms. Harris’s husband, and his son and daughter-in-law.</p><p>They were also joined by Mr. Walz’s daughter, Hope Walz, who has been a steady but quiet presence with her father on the trail, appearing mostly in transit but offering occasional sarcastic quips within earshot of reporters.</p><p>“You guys don’t have Diet Mountain Dew, right?” Ms. Walz asked the staff behind the counter at Otro, referring to her father’s preferred beverage, even at 10:15 a.m. (Aside from boosting his Real American bona fides, Mr. Walz’s soda choice is also a rare point of agreement with Mr. Vance, his Republican counterpart.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Before the event in Chandler, Mr. Walz and his daughter, Hope, stopped at Otro Cafe in Phoenix for breakfast, along with Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick Breen/The Republic, via USA Today Network</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Breakfast meant that Mr. Walz was late arriving in Chandler. About 80 veterans and military family members had gathered in folding chairs at V.F.W. Post 7401, a squat sun-baked building named for John McCain, the late Republican senator, decorated Navy officer and prisoner of war.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. McCain’s son Jim McCain, who has endorsed Ms. Harris and Mr. Walz, spoke first at the event, introducing Representative Ruben Gallego, a fellow Marine and Democrat who is in a heated race against Kari Lake, a Republican, for a Senate seat.</p><p>Mr. Walz thanked everybody, then recalled the elder Mr. McCain from his time as a Minnesota congressman. “When you’re kind of a junior member of the House, senators don’t have any damn idea who you are,” Mr. Walz said, to laughter. “John McCain knew your first name.”</p><p>Mr. Walz spoke without notes, but he also appeared to be treading carefully. He served 24 years in the Army National Guard, but he has come under scrutiny for his imprecise framing of his military record, which exaggerated his combat experience, and for his retirement just before his unit went to Iraq. (His departure was to serve in Congress, and he has defended his record: “I am damn proud of my service to this country.”)</p><p>He described his service briefly and deliberately and discussed his work on the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. The commitment that service members make to America, regardless of political beliefs. Leadership. Character. Liz Cheney.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Then the motorcade was off to tribal land: the Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass, in the Gila River Indian Community.</p><p>In a carpeted conference room, about three dozen tribal leaders were standing before a microphone, facing a line of tribal nation flags in the corner of the room.</p><p>Mr. Walz is good at the public stand-and-nod, which is practically a requirement of the job of governor. It helps that he has an expressive face that transmits enthusiasm in Technicolor — and that he has toned down the irrepressible excitement that radiated from him in the immediate wake of his selection as Ms. Harris’s running mate.</p><p>He was also, clearly, on comfortable ground. There are 11 tribal nations in Minnesota, Mr. Walz noted. He described the importance of building a partnership with sovereign tribes. “On the issue of Indigenous rights, we are not going back,” he said, adapting a phrase of the campaign. “It’s an honor to earn your vote.”</p><p>When his motorcade arrived at the Phoenix airport, later that afternoon, a surprise was waiting: His chartered Boeing 757 had been wrapped for the campaign, with stars and stripes on the tail and “A New Way Forward” on the side. He would arrive in Tucson in style for the last leg of the trip.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Actually, there were two airport surprises. Mr. Vance’s campaign plane was across the tarmac, about 200 yards away. Mr. Trump’s running mate landed about an hour earlier. The world is small, and runways are smaller, in the last weeks of a competitive campaign. Blame the Electoral College.</p><p>Mr. Walz pointed up at his plane, looking back at the press and staff. Then he raised both hands in a shrug of disbelief and amazement, with an open-mouthed smile, and bounded up the stairs.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
