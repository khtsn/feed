On the first trading day since Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/trump-scott-bessent-treasury.html" title="">chose the billionaire financier Scott Bessent</a> as his pick for Treasury secretary, investors seem to be signaling they like the choice.</p><p><strong>The hedge fund mogul is seen as a steady hand to enact the president-elect’s economic vision</strong> — and, just as important, oversee the $28 trillion Treasuries market. “Investors prefer orthodoxy, predictability, and coherence from economic policy; there were fears that some of the candidates may not possess those attributes. Bessent does,” Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a research note on Monday.</p><p><strong>The Key Square Group founder overcame serious opposition from some in Trump’s inner circle.</strong> Elon Musk derided Bessent as a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/politics/trump-treasury-secretary-tariffs.html" title="">business-as-usual choice</a>” and threw his weight behind Howard Lutnick, the C.E.O. of Cantor Fitzgerald. When Trump tapped Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department instead, Bessent was left to fight it out against the likes of Marc Rowan, the boss of Apollo Global Management, the private equity giant.</p><p><strong>Bessent won a “knife fight” to get the nod. </strong>On Wall Street, a document was circulated suggesting that his <a href="https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/11/19/2024/semafor-business-treasury-race-gets-messy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Key Square hedge fund had</a> underperformed the booming markets. Bessent’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/23/us/politics/scott-bessent-treasury-profile.html" title="">ascent is notable</a> in that he doesn’t appear to have been on Trump’s radar during his first administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>His background as a former Democratic donor who worked with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/us/politics/george-soros-bragg-trump.html" title="">George Soros</a>, a villain for the right, has also been scrutinized. (Interesting fact: Bessent furnished the progressive billionaire financier with key data that prompted Soros to make one of his most famous trades: <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treasury-pick-scott-bessent-scored-182333132.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shorting the British pound</a>.) Some Trump backers, including Palmer Luckey, the defense tech entrepreneur, <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1857854390532714537" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worried about Bessent’s commitment</a> to the president-elect’s America-first agenda.</p><p><strong>Investors appear to have fewer qualms.</strong> Bessent gets high marks as a fiscal conservative and a champion of growth — at Key Square, he told clients that Trumponomics would usher in an “<a href="https://assets.realclear.com/files/2024/02/2353_keysquare.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economic lollapalooza</a>” — through deregulation and lower taxes.</p><p>Bessent pitched Trump on a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/the-ex-soros-executive-who-is-trumps-new-obsession-4be2d493" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“3-3-3” policy approach</a> that appears to have earned him points. It involves:</p><ul><li><p>cutting the budget deficit to 3 percent by 2028, from roughly 6 percent today;</p></li><li><p>boosting G.D.P. growth to 3 percent;</p></li><li><p>and encouraging Big Oil to produce an additional 3 million barrels of crude (or energy equivalents) per day.</p></li></ul><p><strong>But markets are worried about the potential inflationary effects of Trump’s agenda. </strong>The Republican’s plans for widespread tariffs and his promise to crack down on immigration could push up the value of the dollar, scramble the bond market and force the new administration to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/business/dealbook/trump-economy-bonds.html" title="">dial back its economic stimulus efforts</a>.</p><p><strong>Also worth watching:</strong> Whether Bessent’s more moderate views on tariffs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/business/dealbook/howard-lutnick-commerce-secretary-trump.html" title="">conflict with Lutnick’s</a>, and how he approaches the Fed if he is confirmed. Bessent has spelled out a plan to appoint a shadow chair of the central bank, and may be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-23/trump-s-treasury-pick-wants-shadow-fed-chair-maybe-weak-dollar?sref=0w5HLLb3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a hugely influential adviser</a> to Trump on whether to replace Jay Powell when his term expires in 2026.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="link-594cd70c"><span>HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING </span></h3><p><strong>Intel’s shares fall in premarket trading as the White House is set to cut its CHIPS funding</strong>.
