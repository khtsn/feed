Since September, he has been incarcerated at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, inside a special housing unit where high-profile inmates are often assigned.</p><p>In the court filing, the government accused Mr. Combs of “relentless efforts” to contact potential witnesses, including by attempting to use three-way calls to contact associates whom prosecutors consider part of his “criminal enterprise.” Prosecutors also accused Mr. Combs of making unauthorized calls by using the telephone accounts of at least eight other inmates, instructing others to pay them — sometimes through their commissary accounts — to secure their cooperation.</p><p>“The defendant has demonstrated an uncanny ability to get others to do his bidding — employees, family members, and M.D.C. inmates alike,” prosecutors wrote.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Details of the recipients and substance of the phone calls were redacted in the court documents. The calls generated using other inmates’ privileges were not identified as being directed at witnesses, but prosecutors said they were evidence of Mr. Combs’s disregard for the jail’s regulations and were part of what they described as obstruction efforts.</p><p>Representatives for Mr. Combs, who is known as Diddy, did not immediately respond to the allegations about Mr. Combs’s communications. He has pleaded not guilty and vehemently denied the criminal charges, arguing that the drug-fueled sexual encounters called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html" title="">“freak offs”</a> at the heart of his case were all consensual.</p><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers have said that if granted bail, their client would be put under extremely restricted conditions with no access to a phone or internet, and would abide by limitations on whom he contacts. The proposed bail package includes a $50 million bond and a team of private security personnel to monitor Mr. Combs at all hours to assure the court that he would not engage in obstruction efforts.</p><p>The judge who denied Mr. Combs bail in September, ruling that he posed a danger of witness tampering and a safety risk to others, has since recused himself because of a professional and social relationship with a new lawyer hired by Mr. Combs’s team. Mr. Combs renewed his efforts to secure release with the new judge on the case, arguing that the government’s allegations of witness tampering were not supported by evidence.</p><p>“The evidence makes clear that the government’s case is thin,” Mr. Combs’s lawyers wrote in a filing this month, later noting that if witnesses were contacted to support his defense, “that alone does not amount to obstruction or evidence any risk of obstruction.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Prosecutors have focused on a witness named Kalenna Harper, a performer who was in the group Diddy — Dirty Money with Dawn Richard, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/arts/music/dawn-richard-danity-kane-lawsuit-sean-combs-diddy.html" title="">filed a lawsuit shortly before Mr. Combs’s arrest</a> that accused him of groping and threatening her. The government has highlighted Mr. Combs’s repeated contact with Ms. Harper after the lawsuit was filed, arguing that she was pressured to post <a href="https://people.com/kalenna-harper-denies-diddy-abuse-claims-dawn-richard-lawsuit-8713126" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement posted on her Instagram account</a> countering some of Ms. Richard’s claims in the suit. Mr. Combs’s lawyers have said that Ms. Harper volunteered that statement herself.</p><p>Referring to Ms. Harper as “Witness 2” in court papers, prosecutors said they recovered new evidence about those communications in a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/nyregion/doj-mdc-brooklyn-prison.html" title="">sweep of the Metropolitan Detention Center</a>, which was part of continuing efforts to address persistent complaints of inhumane conditions at the jail.</p><p>Prosecutors said that investigators from the Federal Bureau of Prisons found notes in Mr. Combs’s cell related to Ms. Harper. The contents of the notes were redacted, but prosecutors wrote that the “strong inference” was that Mr. Combs paid Ms. Harper after she posted her statement to Instagram. Ms. Harper did not immediately return requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Combs’s lawyers have already taken issue with the jail sweep, writing in court papers that Mr. Combs was removed from his unit as officers “ruffled through” his notes and seized his pens, leaving him unable to take notes on the huge tranches of discovery that are being gradually transferred over to the defense by the government.</p><p>At M.D.C., Mr. Combs has been living in the same unit as Sam Bankman-Fried, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/technology/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced.html" title="">crypto mogul convicted of fraud</a>, sleeping in a dormitory-style room with a group of other defendants and getting access to his family through monitored phone calls and an email system that requires payment. Mr. Combs’s lawyers took issue this month with their inability to get their client a secured laptop to prepare for his trial, which is scheduled to start in May.</p><p>Now, Mr. Combs’s access to the outside world is likely to be further contested, as the government argues that the defendant is using his resources and communications with his family to try to both contact potential witnesses and pursue a “public relations” strategy to influence public perceptions of his case. One example that the government cited was Mr. Combs’s involvement in planning a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB9lgi1tXiF/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video posted to social media</a> that showed his children wishing him a happy birthday.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
