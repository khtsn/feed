The candidates have never been more accomplished or better funded. The results could be a bellwether for midterm congressional elections.</p><p>But first, the candidates must figure out how to make themselves heard — over each other and amid a backdrop of unmatched upheaval in Washington.</p><p>That’s a particular challenge for the Democratic contenders, who include two members of Congress, two big-city mayors and two union leaders.</p><p>“To have six Democrats, all who could pretty legitimately have a chance — that’s really rare,” said Kristoffer Shields, director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>All of the candidates have made clear their opposition to President Trump’s funding cuts and attempts to enact mass deportations.

After a presidential election in which voters took a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/nyregion/trump-nj-votes-election.html" title="">sharp rightward turn</a>, Mr. Baraka, the mayor of Newark, has no real company on the far left.</p><p>He speaks of New Jersey’s highly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/nyregion/new-jersey-schools-segregation.html" title="">segregated schools</a> and a racial wealth gap that by <a href="https://njisj.org/reports/deepeningdivide/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one estimate</a> has doubled since 2020. He describes the Trump administration’s immigration arrests as “kidnapping Black and brown people off the street” and says racism is a cause of the state’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/nyregion/maternal-mortality-new-jersey.html" title="">high rates of maternal mortality</a> among Black women.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a speech last week, he questioned how Democratic leaders could continue to depend so heavily on minority voters while failing to address their most basic and urgent needs.</p><p>“They don’t see us,” said Mr. Baraka, who is Black. “If you don’t see me, you can’t solve my problems.”</p><p>Mr. Baraka, 55, also points to his role in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/nyregion/new-jersey-newark-redevelopment.html" title="">economic progress</a> of Newark, the state’s largest city, and his efforts to build <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/nyregion/performing-arts-real-estate-nj.html" title="">affordable housing</a> and tamp down crime rates. His three terms as mayor, he tells audiences, have prepared him to scale that success statewide.</p><p>In polls, he has frequently ranked at the front of the pack, jockeying with several other candidates for second place.</p><p>Yet he has also faced blunt questions about whether a left-leaning Democrat can win in November against what is certain to be a well-financed Republican nominee in a state where Mr. Trump fared far better in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-new-jersey-president.html" title="">third race</a> for president than in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/new-jersey-president-clinton-trump" title="">first</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-jersey-president.html" title="">two</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>An internal memo from his chief strategist, Bill Hyers, offered a response.

And he has since issued a series of policy papers that run more than 10 pages each and lay out his platform in detail.</p><p>Since 2013, he has been the mayor of Jersey City, the state’s second-largest city. Like Mr. Baraka, he has said his municipal experience would be an asset in the state capital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Opponents have noted that his campaign accounts are filled with donations from developers. And he has faced criticism in Jersey City from residents upset by his willingness to forge ahead with <a href="https://www.nj.com/hudson/2024/09/amid-heated-debate-and-passionate-opposition-jersey-city-council-oks-pompidou-tax-abatement-deal.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costly plans</a> to bring an outpost of Paris’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/arts/design/pompidou-center-jersey-city.html" title="">Pompidou Center</a> to the city, even after the state <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/arts/design/pompidou-center-international-outposts.html" title="">revoked funding</a>.</p><p>In ads, Mr. Fulop has embraced an “anti-corruption” message similar to one that helped to propel Andy Kim to the U.S. Senate last year after the stunning fall from grace by one of the state’s longtime Democratic leaders, Robert Menendez, a former senator ultimately convicted of taking bribes.</p><p>At 48, Mr. Fulop is the youngest candidate in the race. He has emphasized his anti-establishment streak, his Jewish heritage and his willingness to quit a Wall Street finance job after the Sept. 11 terror attacks to join the Marines.</p><p>“I viewed it as a partial payment for citizenship,” he said of his military service.</p><p>Unlike the other candidates, Mr. Fulop is running with a ticket of candidates for the State Legislature. His strategists hope that a handful of spirited legislative races, particularly in districts in Hudson and Bergen Counties, help to boost Mr. Fulop.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p><h2 id="link-44037428">Fighting Back Against Trump</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Gottheimer, a moderate representing New Jersey’s Fifth Congressional District, has become known as an aggressive politician and a demanding boss.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For months, Josh Gottheimer has stuck to a disciplined and streamlined policy platform: making New Jersey more affordable.

But Mr. Gottheimer’s ad was the most provocative display of just how large a role the president was likely to play in November’s general election in a state where registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2025/2025-05-voter-registration-by-congressional-district.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 800,000 voters</a>.</p><p>The ad also appeared to portray as a virtue a trait sometimes held out as a knock against Mr. Gottheimer, who in the more than eight years that he has represented New Jersey’s Fifth Congressional District has become known as an aggressive and sharp-tongued politician. A demanding boss, he has regularly ranked near the top of a list of legislators with the highest staff turnover in Congress.</p><p>“He’s tenacious and tough — especially if someone messes with our families, and that’s not something he shies away from,” his campaign manager and former chief of staff, Chelsea Brossard, said. “That’s what he thinks Jersey needs right now.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>In Washington, Mr. Gottheimer has been a leader of a bipartisan caucus of moderates, and he was an early opponent of New York’s new congestion pricing tolls. He was the only Democrat in New Jersey’s congressional delegation to support the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/laken-riley-act-explained.html" title="">Laken Riley Act</a>, which directs the authorities to detain and deport undocumented immigrants who are accused, but not convicted, of certain crimes.</p><p>Mr. Gottheimer has made efforts to win support from ultra-Orthodox Jews, who have built thriving communities in Ocean, Bergen, Hudson and Union Counties and often vote as a bloc.</p><p>He is also the only candidate from Bergen County, which has the state’s <a href="https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/svrs-reports/2025/2025-05-voter-registration-by-county.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second-highest number</a> of registered Democrats, after Essex.</p><p>Early in the campaign, Mr. Gottheimer was mocked after he released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/politics/josh-gottheimer-spotify-wrapped.html" title="">fake Spotify playlist</a> that made it look like his most-played songs were Bruce Springsteen hits.</p><p>Last week, he took a step toward re-establishing his Springsteen street cred in a state where the rock icon holds Everyman appeal: He was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW0tIekMnfY" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endorsed</a> by Stevie Van Zandt, a guitarist in Mr. Springsteen’s E Street Band.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Sherrill, who represents the state’s 11th Congressional District, is seen as the race’s front-runner.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rachel Wisniewski for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mikie Sherrill has not strayed far from a carefully curated image as a mother and Navy helicopter pilot trained “to run toward the fight.”</p><p>As the front-runner in every poll taken since March 2024, she has not had to.</p><p>Her campaign logo is a helicopter, and she appears in ads in a bomber jacket. At forums, Ms. Sherrill — the only woman in the race — notes that two of her four children will follow in her footsteps next month when they enter the United States Naval Academy, her alma mater.</p><p>At a forum in Newark, she linked her opposition to the Trump administration to the Naval Academy, noting that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/naval-academy-dei-books-removed.html" title="">books by Maya Angelou and other writers</a> had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/us/politics/naval-academy-banned-books.html" title="">ordered removed</a> from a library at the school because their subject matter was seen as being related to so-called diversity, equity and inclusion topics. “They are allowing two copies of Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’ to stay on the shelves, but removing Maya Angelou. So you can study why Hitler decided to commit genocide but you can’t hear why the caged bird sings,” she said, alluding to Ms. Angelou’s autobiography.</p><p>Ms. Sherrill, 53, who has represented New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District since 2019, has more support from county Democratic Party bosses than any other candidate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>That used to be enough to win elections in a state that for decades gave candidates backed by local party leaders an often insurmountable advantage by putting them in a preferred spot on the ballot. But after a lawsuit by Senator Kim, a federal judge ordered an end to the practice.</p><p>Her spot at the front of the pack has made her a target.</p><p>Mr. Baraka went to Montclair, where she lives, to release a 10-point critique. Mr. Fulop questioned the degree to which <a href="https://x.com/StevenFulop/status/1916576754946265289" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">her campaign has emphasized</a> her military service. And Steve Sweeney, a former State Senate president who is also running for governor, set up a website criticizing her for accepting $31,500 for her congressional races from a political action committee linked to SpaceX, an aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, an influential Trump aide.</p><p>In March, as protests outside Mr. Musk’s Tesla car stores grew, Ms. Sherrill’s aides said that she had donated $31,500 to a <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/03/nj-dems-ditch-musk-money-in-high-stakes-governor-primary.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">food bank</a>.</p><h2 id="link-3f0665c">An Immigrant Background</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Spiller is the president of the New Jersey Education Association, one of the state’s largest labor unions.

By sidestepping that funding stream, he has said, he will avoid being beholden to their interests if elected.</p><p>At public appearances, he often speaks about the need to defend immigrants like his parents. “It’s personal to me,” Mr. Spiller said at a forum last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>Mr. Spiller served one term as <a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/governor/a-brief-electoral-history-of-sean-spiller/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mayor</a> of Montclair, N.J.
