Given that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26628467/taylor-swift-30th-birthday-lessons/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the pop star once said</a> her “biggest fear” was a terrorist attack at one of her shows, some fans had doubts. Was it even safe to attend those London dates?</p><p>When Swift did not comment on the thwarted attack in Vienna or the upcoming London gigs, fan anxieties only grew.</p><p>Yet when the singer took the stage on Thursday evening, worry gave way to excitement at the chance to see Swift perform during the European leg of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/05/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour.html" title="">her globe-spanning Eras Tour</a>. As Swift walked onstage singing “It’s been a long time coming” — a refrain from her track “Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince” — the sold-out crowd cheered deliriously.</p></div></div><div><div><p>She then launched into “Cruel Summer.”</p><p>Despite the public focus on the Austrian plot, Swift did not immediately comment on it during Thursday’s show. Instead, she began as normal a three-plus-hour spectacle featuring tracks from throughout her career.</p><p>In interviews before the show, more than a dozen fans, including many from the United States, all said they felt safe attending the event. Kyle Foster — wearing a Kansas City Chiefs jersey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/arts/music/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-timeline.html" title="">like Swift’s partner, Travis Kelce</a> — said he had flown from North Carolina with his partner and two daughters for the show.</p><p>“We didn’t think twice about coming,” said Foster, 46, adding that he felt confident security would “be on high alert.”</p><p>Maya Arbad, 18, who had traveled from Dubai, said two friends had decided not to attend the concert because of the foiled attack. “Their families were just too anxious to send them here,” Arbad said.</p></div></div><div><p>That had made her question the trip, too, Arbad added, “but my dad said, ‘Let’s just do it. We’ve been waiting too long.’”</p></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maya Arbad, right, and her father, Zaidoun Arbad, traveled from Dubai for the concert. “My dad said, ‘Let’s just do it,’” Maya said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Wembley already had strict <a href="https://www.wembleystadium.com/news/2024/06/13/13/09/Taylor-Swift-The-Eras-Tour" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">security measures</a>, including a ban on bringing large bags into the stadium. After the cancellations in Vienna last week, the venue also forbade ticketless Swifties from gathering outside the arena, as they have done at other stops on the Eras Tour, to soak up the atmosphere and exchange friendship bracelets.</p><p>Austrian police said the main suspect in Vienna was a 19-year-old man who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State after being radicalized online. Officers had found chemicals that could be used to make bombs, as well as machetes and knives, in the man’s home, a senior security official said last week.</p><p>The plan was reminiscent of other recent atrocities at European concert venues, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/world/europe/paris-shooting-attacks.html" title="">including a 2015 attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris</a>, where more than 90 people died, and a 2017 suicide bombing at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/world/europe/manchester-arena-bombing-report-ariana-grande.html" title="">an Ariana Grande concert</a>, in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people. This year, gunmen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/23/world/europe/moscow-concert-hall-attack-what-we-know.html" title="">attacked a Moscow rock show</a>, killing more than 140 concertgoers.</p><p>In recent days, British police and politicians played down the threat of a similar event happening at Wembley. A spokesman for the London police said there was “nothing to indicate that the matters being investigated by the Austrian authorities will have an impact on upcoming events here.”</p><p>Several security experts said in interviews that large British theaters and arenas had greatly improved their security since the bombing at the Grande concert.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans arrived with many Swift-themed touches to their outfits.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rhinestones, sequins and sparkle abounded.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans have been swapping friendship bracelets at Eras Tour concerts.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ayesha Kazim for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60cc659fe90e07438f7af765/CCS0321126370-002_MAI_Report_Volume_ONE_WebAccessible.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A government-commissioned inquiry</a> revealed numerous security lapses that led to the attack at Manchester Arena. The bomber, Salman Abedi, who had scoped the venue beforehand, spent over an hour hiding in a security camera blind spot. A member of the public also told a steward about a suspicious man with a bag lurking in a foyer, but guards brushed it off. A member of security staff told the inquiry that he had been afraid higher-ups would accuse him of racially profiling the bomber.</p><p>Reg Walker, the director of I.S.G. Security, which works at many of Britain’s largest entertainment venues, said that British security teams used to focus on managing the lines of people entering concerts. Now, operations extend to surveillance inside the venue, as well as at train stations and parking lots, both before and after shows.</p><p>Wembley’s security — which is led by Steven McGrath, a former British counterterrorism official — was among the best, Walker said.</p><p>On Thursday, the visible security measures were similar to those at any other major pop concert. A handful of police officers watched over the pedestrian promenades around the stadium while dozens of security staff patrolled the gathering crowd.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Although bags were banned in the arena, they were allowed in the stadium’s merchandise store — after a thorough search. Fans could purchase Eras-themed T-shirts and sweatshirts and even a Swift water bottle, although signs at the cashiers warned, “Water bottles are unable to be taken into the stadium.”</p><p>Even with the extra security measures, terrorism seemed to be the last thing on the minds of the 90,000 Swifties in Wembley. They sang and danced along to their idol’s every word, some hugging nearby strangers as if they could not believe they finally had a chance to see her.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
