She drew an audience of 27 million. The hashtag #BeyonceBowl ranked above even #Christmas on X, according to Netflix.</p><p>The game was streamed, rather than broadcast, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/business/media/netflix-nfl-live.html" title="">part of a three-season deal</a> between the league and Netflix.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The broadcast records still stand above Netflix’s streaming numbers.

But in March, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/business/media/netflix-nfl-live.html" title="">the company announced</a> the three-season N.F.L. deal, which included broadcasting two Christmas Day games to its 283 million global subscribers this year. The games were the streaming service’s latest foray into live sports, following the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing fight last month that Netflix said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/arts/television/nfl-games-beyonce-netflix-christmas.html" title="">peaked at 65 million streams</a>.</p><p>The Christmas Day N.F.L. games featured two marquee matchups between four playoff opponents from the same conference and a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1871979443796967679" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded performance</a> by Mariah Carey, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/arts/music/mariah-carey-christmas.html" title="">Queen of Christmas</a>. But some viewers came just for the Beyoncé concert. The viewership for the Ravens-Texans game peaked at 27 million viewers during Queen Bey’s halftime show, Netflix said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some viewers said on social media that they were nervous about whether Netflix would be able to handle the millions of viewers that were expected to stream the two N.F.L. games. The Tyson-Paul fight in November was plagued by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/arts/television/jake-paul-wins-mike-tyson-fight-netflix.html" title="">buffering problems and fuzzy picture quality</a>.</p><p>On Christmas Eve, Beyoncé poked fun at that less-than-perfect boxing stream in <a href="https://x.com/Beyonce/status/1871601919879504138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a teaser video</a> that stalled out in the middle. But aside from some audio trouble at the beginning of the first game, the Christmas Day stream was a relatively flawless experience.</p><p>Then again, it might not have felt that flawless for Steelers and Texans fans, whose teams got a holiday walloping.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hank Sanders is a Times reporter and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/hank-sanders">More about Hank Sanders</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-football-league">National Football League</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/nielsen-media-research">Nielsen Media Research</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Find the Right Soundtrack for You</h2><h3>Trying to expand your musical horizons?
