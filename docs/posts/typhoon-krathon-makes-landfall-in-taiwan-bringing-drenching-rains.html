Two people had been killed and over 200 have been injured.</p><p>The storm made landfall at 12:40 p.m. in Kaohsiung, a major port city home to 2.7 million people, Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration said. The weather administration predicted that it would weaken into a tropical depression on Friday as it moves north over land. </p><p>For the past two days, the storm lingered near Taiwan’s southern coast, slowing down and weakening as it approached the island. Krathon’s slow pace has allowed it to lash some places with relentless rain. Taitung County, in the southeast, has received up to 4.2 feet of rain since Tuesday, while nearby Pingtung County has received about 3.9 feet in the same period. </p><p>The rainfall has triggered multiple landslides in Taitung, Pintung and the northeastern port city of Keelung. Flooding has also been reported in Keelung and Kaohsiung.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Taiwan’s National Fire Agency on Thursday afternoon said that two people had died and 219 had been injured during the storm. In Hualien County in the east, a 70-year-old died from falling off a ladder when attempting to prune tree branches. In Taitung, a 66-year-old truck driver died after crashing into a large rock that fell onto the road.</p><p>The storm complicated rescue efforts after a fire broke out at Antai Hospital in Pintung County and killed nine people on Thursday, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency. The remaining 324 patients at the hospital were rescued, the county’s mayor said on social media. The fire was put out in the afternoon. </p><p>Taiwanese authorities shut down the island on Wednesday and Thursday, closing schools and workplaces and the national stock exchange. All domestic flights have been grounded and many international flights were canceled on Thursday. More than 10,000 people had been evacuated in multiple counties as of Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Although typhoons are common in Taiwan, they usually hit the island’s mountainous, sparsely populated east coast, and rarely make landfall on the more populated west coast.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Liu covers China and technology for The Times, focusing primarily on the interplay between politics and technology supply chains.
