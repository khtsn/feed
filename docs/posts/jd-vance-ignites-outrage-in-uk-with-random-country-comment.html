Britain and France had come to America’s aid then, he said, “deploying 1,000s of personnel to Afghanistan, including my own brother &amp; numerous parliamentary colleagues, past and present.” <a href="https://x.com/jcartlidgemp/status/1896873982097576071" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">He added</a>, “It’s deeply disrespectful to ignore such service and sacrifice.”</p><p>Helen Maguire, a spokeswoman for the Liberal Democratic Party on defense and a former captain in Britain’s Royal Military Police who served on a NATO peacekeeping mission in Iraq, said, “JD Vance is erasing from history the hundreds of British troops who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.”</p><p>Sébastien Lecornu, France’s defense minister, told lawmakers in Paris on Tuesday that Mr. Vance had “fortunately corrected his statement,” but added that the 600 or so French soldiers who had died in service over the past 60 years “deserve our respect and the respect of our allies.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The leader of Britain’s Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, however, said she did not believe that Mr. Vance was referring to Britain when he spoke about a random country. “A lot of people are getting carried away,” she said to GB News. “They’re saying loads of things and getting quite animated.”</p><p>Aurelien Breeden<!-- --> contributed reporting from Paris.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Mark Landler is the London bureau chief of The Times, covering the United Kingdom, as well as American foreign policy in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
