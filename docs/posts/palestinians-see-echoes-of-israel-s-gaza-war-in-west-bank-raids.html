The Israeli military declined to provide a death toll, but contended that “98 percent” of the people killed in airstrikes were “involved in terrorist activities.”</p><p>The strikes have caused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/west-bank-raids.html" title="">extensive damage</a> to roads, electricity networks and water and sewage lines.

(The Israeli military said it operated in accordance with international law.)</p><p>Instead of calling them raids, residents, aid workers and some experts have likened what is happening in the West Bank to a war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We call Jenin a small Gaza,” said Saleem Al-Sade, a member of a local neighborhood council.</p><p>As he walked through a neighborhood known as Jenin camp, which started as a refugee camp for Palestinians displaced from their homes in what is now Israel, he pointed out the constant sound overhead of Israeli drones that carry out surveillance and airstrikes.</p><p>“It’s a Gazafication of the northern part of the West Bank,” said Nadav Weiman, the director of Breaking the Silence, an advocacy group made up of former Israeli soldiers who say they are collecting testimonies from soldiers who took part in the raids in Jenin and another city, Tulkarm.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A view of Jenin from a mosque destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinian children playing under tarpaulins hung up to block the view of Israeli drones in the Nur Shams refugee camp.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Raids into Palestinian areas of the West Bank have become common since the Oct. 7 attacks last year. Beyond the armed drones, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/west-bank-raids.html" title="">bulldozers have ripped up the roads</a>, which the Israeli military says is to unearth explosives buried beneath the pavement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But the strikes in the past few months were some of the most extensive and deadly in the West Bank in two decades.</p><p>The Israeli military described the raids as a “counterterrorism operation” to crack down on Palestinian armed groups and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/world/middleeast/west-bank-attacks-israel-gaza.html" title="">combat rising attacks against Israelis</a>, including shootings and attempts to set off car bombs. The violence has accompanied a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/world/middleeast/israel-settlers-attack-jit-west-bank.html" title="">surge in attacks</a> against Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli settlers who often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/magazine/israel-west-bank-settler-violence-impunity.html" title="">operate with impunity</a>.</p><p>In its operations in the West Bank, the Israeli military said it had killed or detained dozens of fighters, confiscated explosives and destroyed command and control centers. It added that it carried out airstrikes “in situations where arrests cannot be made due to real risk to the forces.”</p><p>The military’s actions in the West Bank were long shrouded in secrecy, but experts said Israel had largely refrained from conducting airstrikes on the territory since the end of the second intifada, nearly 20 years ago. At times, Israel used attack helicopters in select operations, but experts said that happened in only a few cases that they knew of over the two decades.</p><p>The Israeli military’s deployment of armed drones appeared to have been exceedingly rare. Palestinian reports of it emerged in 2022, but only a few cases were confirmed before Oct. 7, 2023.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Since then, Israeli forces have carried out dozens of strikes in northern areas of the West Bank, largely concentrated in the cities and towns of Jenin, Tulkarm, Nablus and Tubas.</p><p>In visits to Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarm, The Times encountered multiple accounts of Palestinians being forced to perform potentially dangerous missions for Israeli soldiers.

The next day, the Israeli military returned and blew up the cave.</p><p>In response to questions about two cases involving the use of human shields in Jenin, including Mr. Damaj, the Israeli military said, “The incidents mentioned in the inquiry appear to contradict I.D.F. orders.” It added that it did not have enough information to confirm or deny whether the episodes took place.</p><p>It did confirm an action involving the cave, however, saying “an underground combat facility located beneath a mosque was destroyed.”</p><p>In 2005, Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that the military’s use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/06/international/middleeast/israel-bans-use-of-palestinian-civilians-as-human.html" title="">civilians as human shields</a> violated international law and banned the practice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>“You cannot exploit the civilian population for the army’s military needs, and you cannot force them to collaborate with the army,” Ahron Barak, then chief justice, wrote in the ruling.</p><p>But Palestinians in the West Bank say the practice never stopped.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-33"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Palestinian woman observing an Israeli drone buzzing overhead in Jenin.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-34"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Bullet holes in the window of a medical clinic in Jenin camp.
