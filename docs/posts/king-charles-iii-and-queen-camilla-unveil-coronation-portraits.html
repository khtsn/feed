In 1986, the then Prince Charles commissioned Mr. Kuhfeld to paint his sons, William and Harry.</p><p>Mr. Kuhfeld has said that Charles’s patronage helped to kick-start his career. “My name started to be bandied around London,” the artist said in <a href="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/perspectives-of-life-a65367/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2012 interview</a>. “Whatever I was doing for the prince was in demand.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Later, the prince paid for Mr. Kuhfeld to accompany him on several royal tours, including to Iran and to Japan, asking the artist to paint whatever inspired him.</p><p>In a news release on Tuesday, Mr. Kuhfeld said that the painting had taken him “over a year and a half to complete” and that he had “tried to produce a painting that is both human and regal, continuing the tradition of royal portraiture.”</p><p>Mr. Benney, who also paints more abstract works (<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/search-results?q=%22paul+benney%22" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two of which</a> are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s collections), has long associations with the royal family, too. In 2015, he painted <a href="https://www.paulbenney.com/paintings/portraits/#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth stroking a horse</a>, and in 2022, Charles commissioned him to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59957260?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=KARANGA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paint Holocaust survivors’ portraits</a> for display at Buckingham Palace.</p><p>Before Tuesday’s ceremony, Mr. Benney had posted <a href="https://www.paulbenney.com/news/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on his website</a> about the job of painting Camilla, revealing that she had sat for him multiple times at Clarence House in London. At one point, Mr. Benney said, security guards brought the coronation crown from the Tower of London for him to “sketch and scrutinize.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Marshall is a Times reporter covering European culture.
