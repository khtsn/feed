It is the largest single area of public land in the United States. It covers crucial habitat for grizzly bears, polar bears, caribou, thousands of migratory birds and other wildlife.</p><p>Created in the early 1900s, the reserves were originally envisioned as a fuel supply for the Navy in times of emergency. But in 1976, Congress authorized full commercial development of the federal land and ordered the government to balance oil drilling with conservation and wildlife protection.</p><p>Mr. Burgum accused the Biden administration of prioritizing “obstruction over production and undermining our ability to harness domestic resources at a time when American energy independence has never been more critical.”</p><p>The announcement came as Mr. Burgum traveled to Alaska, accompanied by Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Chris Wright, the secretary of the Energy Department. The three were expected to encourage companies to drill in sensitive areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to support a liquefied natural gas pipeline in the state.</p><p>The plan to allow drilling in the petroleum reserve drew praise from the oil industry.</p><p>Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are the main driver of climate change, which is heating the planet and creating dangerous new weather patterns. Alaska is warming at a rate two to three times as fast as the global average, resulting in thawing permafrost and melting sea ice. It is also disrupting the hunting, fishing and food-gathering practices of Indigenous communities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Alaska Native groups have been divided over the Trump administration’s plans for the region.</p><p>“Too often, federal decisions that affect our homelands are made without the engagement of the North Slope Inupiat, the people these decisions will affect the most,” said Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat<strong>,</strong> which represents Inupiat leadership organizations on the North Slope and supports oil and gas projects.</p><p>The group supports allowing oil and gas projects in the region, and Mr. Harcharek said the visit by Mr. Burgum and others “shows the federal government sees our communities and people as partners, not a check-the-box exercise.”</p><p>Others said opening up the reserve threatened to destroy habitat for caribou and thousands of migratory birds, and would put communities that depend on subsistence hunting at risk.</p><p>“This is very concerning to us,” said Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, a former mayor of the predominantly Inupiaq city of Nuiqsut.</p><p>Matt Jackson, the Alaska State senior manager at The Wilderness Society, an environmental group, called the repeal of environmental protections an outrage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“This move will accelerate the climate crisis at a time when the ground beneath Alaska communities is literally melting away and subsistence foods are in decline,” Mr. Jackson said.</p><p>Environmental groups and the fossil fuel industry have battled for decades over Alaska’s most pristine and remote places, which often happen to lie over significant oil, gas and mineral deposits.</p><p>During his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — home to migrating caribou, polar bears, musk oxen, millions of birds and other wildlife — to drilling. But a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/climate/arctic-wildlife-refuge-drilling-leases.html" title="">lease sale there held in January flopped</a>, ending without a single bidder.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lisa Friedman is a Times reporter who writes about how governments are addressing climate change and the effects of those policies on communities.</p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>A</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>14</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Trump Administration Is Set to Open Alaskan Wilderness to Drilling and Mining<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Latest on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Falsehoods in Bill: </strong>President Trump has sought to assuage some lawmakers’ concerns over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/trump-big-beautiful-bill-facts.html">domestic policy bill’s price tag and cuts to Medicaid with inaccurate claims.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Butterworth&#39;s MAGA Scene</strong>: For Trump’s political movement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/magazine/butterworths-restaurant-washington-trump-maga.html">Butterworth’s, the see-and-be-seen Capitol Hill restaurant,</a> represents an ostentatious new evolutionary phase: the deplorable as arriviste.</p></li><li><p><strong>Murkowski Pushes Back:</strong> At a time when the Republican Congress has grown increasingly deferential to Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/murkowski-life-under-trump.html">Senator Lisa Murkowski has veered in the opposite direction from her party,</a> using sharp words and her vote on the Senate floor to make a stand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fear at the F.B.I.:</strong> Agents have been forced out.
