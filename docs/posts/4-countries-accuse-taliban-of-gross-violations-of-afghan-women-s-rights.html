The ministers said they intended to take the Taliban to the International Court of Justice, the top U.N. court.</p><p>The treaty, regarded as an international bill of rights for women, was signed in 1979 and includes most of the world’s nations, including Afghanistan, which joined in 2003. (The United States is one of the few countries that has not ratified it.)</p><p>Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban has systematically rolled back many of the rights that women won during the 20-year U.S. occupation. Last month, the Taliban released a 114-page manifesto <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/world/asia/women-taliban-prohibitions-afghanistan.html" title="">codifying its restrictions</a> on women, which include barring them from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/world/asia/afghanistan-girls-schools-taliban.html" title="">secondary schools</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-women-education.html" title="">universities</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/24/world/asia/taliban-women-ngos-afghanistan.html" title="">working for aid organizations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban.html" title="">traveling any significant distance</a> without a male relative.

The court typically has a panel of 15 judges, elected by the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council.</p><p>Its decisions are legally binding with no possibility of appeal, but the body has few means of enforcing them, and the Taliban could ignore the process.</p><p>The formal complaint against the Taliban cannot be filed immediately. The court’s rules require a formal notification that there is a dispute, followed by a six-month period in which the parties are to try to settle their dispute.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>But Afghan women in Europe and North America said they were thrilled the process had been set in motion. Many have joined a Coalition for Justice, which includes more than 100 expat Afghan women who have become activists for those in Afghanistan.</p><p>“Today’s action was a great move and we are very grateful to the countries who listened to the women,” said Ghizal Haress, a lawyer who was the official ombudsperson dealing with government corruption before she fled Kabul in 2021. Ms Haress was among the women whose activism led the four governments to bring a case against the Taliban.</p><p>The activists described lobbying European lawmakers, organizing conferences and holding demonstrations.</p><p>“We knew what was coming as soon as the Taliban arrived,” said Ms. Haress, now a scholar at York University in Toronto. “But we are now making sure that the many women are not forgotten who live under a system of violence and gender apartheid.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A female mannequin in Kabul in 2021.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kiana Hayeri for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marlise Simons is a correspondent in the Paris bureau, focusing on international justice and war-crimes tribunals.
