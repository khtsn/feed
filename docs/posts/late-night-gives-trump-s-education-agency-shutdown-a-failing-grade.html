They’re like ‘Hey, kids, who hates school?’ And they’re like ‘Well, we do!’ and they said, ‘Well, good news, it’s over.’” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“The idea behind this is to let the states come up with their own educational standards. For instance, from here on, in order to receive a high school diploma in Florida, all you have to do is complete the maze on the back of the kids’ menu at Fuddruckers.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“Today, President Trump signed an executive order to shut down the Department of Education.

They pulled it down. A spokesperson for the Pentagon said, ‘We do not view or highlight them’ — not sure what he means by them, but — ‘through the prism of immutable characteristics such as race, ethnicity or sex.’ Right, Jackie Robinson was just a baseball player; nothing special about him. Rosa Parks just loved to ride the bus. She was a commuter.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Imagine how racist you have to be to be racist against Jackie Robinson today.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><blockquote><p>“Don’t blame us — blame our racist software.
