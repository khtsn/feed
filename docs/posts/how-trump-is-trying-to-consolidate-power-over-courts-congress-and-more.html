The president has threatened to <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114141533823019998" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“lead the charge”</a> against the re-election of the rare Republican who dares challenge his agenda, and the party has bent to his will at every turn.</p><p>Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/trump-executive-order-sec-ftc-fcc.html" title="">dismantled independent measures</a> of checks and balances, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-fires-inspectors-general.html" title="">fired inspectors general</a> and installed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/bongino-patel-fbi-trump.html" title="">loyalists</a> at the Justice Department willing to carry out his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/trump-2024-president.html" title="">campaign of retribution</a>.

Mr. Trump has tried to spread his influence through the arts, as well, by making himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/arts/music/trump-kennedy-center.html" title="">chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But Mr. Trump’s latest target — the judiciary — has been described by constitutional scholars and historians as perhaps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-deportations-constitutional-crisis-impeachment.html" title="">the most alarming power play to date</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration brushed off an order by James E. Boasberg of the Federal District Court in Washington, who sought to pause the deportation of a group of migrants, many of whom received little to no due process. Administration officials said that most of the migrants were from Venezuela and that all of them were affiliated with gangs. But officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/trump-deportations-venezuela-gang.html" title="">did not release the migrants’ names or evidence</a> of their alleged crimes.</p><p>Mr. Trump has called for Judge Boasberg to be impeached, arguing on social media that “if a President doesn’t have the right to throw murderers, and other criminals, out of our Country because a Radical Left Lunatic Judge wants to assume the role of President, then our Country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!”</p><p>The White House did not respond late Wednesday to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump has never been consistent in his attacks on the judicial system generally and on judges in particular. Last week during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-speech-justice-department.html" title="">speech at the Department of Justice</a>, he suggested that criticism of Judge Aileen M. Cannon, the Florida jurist who dismissed the classified documents case against him last summer, may not be legal.</p><p>But he has applied the same logic of fairness to court cases that he has to presidential elections: They’re fair if he wins but not if he loses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In one way or another, Mr. Trump has been a party to lawsuits going back to the 1970s, as a private developer and later as a candidate and president. When he has lost cases, he has tended to attack the judges in question as partisan activists or worse.</p><p>When he wins, he praises the judge in question.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s allies say he is using his power to enact an agenda that he promised during the campaign, and that he is executing Article II of the Constitution, which sets out the powers of the president.</p><p>“President Trump’s doing the unthinkable in Washington — he’s doing what he told Americans he was going to do, and he’s doing it fast,” said Mike Davis, founder of the Article III Project, a conservative advocacy group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mike Davis, founder of the Article III Project, a conservative advocacy group, is among Mr. Trump’s allies who say he is simply using power to enact an agenda voters asked for after his election win.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Lee/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Still, a few traditionally right-leaning voices have expressed concern.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial page, for example, said Mr. Trump had campaigned on deporting gang members, “but it’s still troubling to see U.S. officials appear to disdain the law in the name of upholding it.” The New York Post ran a headline on its opinion page that said: “Trump, don’t heed the dangerous urge to attack the rule of law.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Both papers are part of the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, Mr. Trump’s on-again, off-again ally.</p><p>The judiciary, created to provide checks and balances to both the executive and legislative branches, has only rarely faced such open defiance, experts say. Some of Mr. Trump’s top lieutenants <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1901723856152285503" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have suggested he has a right to defy court orders</a>.</p><p>“Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,” Vice President JD Vance declared last month.</p><p>“I don’t care what the judges think — I don’t care what the left thinks,” Mr. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, said this week during an appearance on “Fox &amp; Friends.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-11"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Vice President JD Vance and Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, have both suggested Mr. Trump has a right to defy court orders.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Trump’s allies often point out that he is doing what he said he would do during his campaign, when his policy platform, Agenda 47, laid out an agenda of maximalist presidential power. He and his advisers believe he was stymied in his first term through investigations and a resistant federal bureaucracy.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Some of his closest allies, including Russell T. Vought, Mr. Trump’s current and former director of the Office of Management and Budget, spent years preparing for the possibility of a second Trump presidency, searching for pockets of independence in the executive branch that could be seized.</p><p>Mr. Vought and other Trump allies have advocated a doctrine called the unitary executive, a legal theory that all power in the executive branch flows from the president.</p><p>“The great challenge confronting a conservative president is the existential need for aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch to return power — including power currently held by the executive branch — to the American people,” <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-02.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Vought wrote</a> in the conservative blueprint for a Republican presidential transition, Project 2025. He added that it would take “boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will.”</p><p>One of the dozens of executive orders that Mr. Trump signed since taking office, which called for <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taking over “independent regulatory agencies,”</a> asserted similar goals. “For the federal government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people’s elected president,” the executive order states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a former acting deputy Homeland Security secretary in the first Trump administration and a contributor to Project 2025, said those who criticize Mr. Trump’s use of executive power “are doing so primarily to weaken the presidency and this president in particular under the guise of ‘conventional wisdom’ that has no constitutional foundation.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Russell Vought, whom Mr. Trump appointed to lead the powerful Office of Management and Budget, was a chief architect of the conservative document Project 2025 that has served as a blueprint for Mr. Trump’s strategy.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Critics of how Mr. Trump is approaching his executive authority say the unitary executive theory does not mean that everything the president does is legal.</p><p>Ruth Ben-Ghiat,<strong> </strong>a historian at New York University who studies fascism and authoritarianism, singled out what she said were some of Mr. Trump’s most troubling behaviors: the expansion of executive power, the politicization of the other branches of government, the dismantling of an oversight and accountability structure, and the targeting of those who seek to hold the president and his allies accountable.</p><p>“The ultimate beneficiary of the acts that we’re seeing happen, whether it’s with the judiciary or other agencies, is Trump himself, because it’s an expansion of his personal power,” she said. “The scale and the speed of what’s going on is terrifying.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a White House correspondent, reporting on the second, nonconsecutive term of Donald J.
