Lazar Dukic, a 28-year-old athlete from Serbia, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/us/crossfit-games-2024-death.html" title="">died</a> during an 800-meter open-water swim in Marine Creek Lake.</p><p>Mr. Dukic’s death was the first in the 17-year history of the Games. His death has raised many concerns, some longstanding, about the safety of CrossFit as both a workout regimen and a high-level athletic competition. </p><p>When Greg Glassman, a personal trainer and a former gymnast, founded CrossFit in the mid 1990s, he took an approach to exercise that was radically different from the bench presses and dumbbell curls that prevailed at gyms at the time. His methodology combined elements of Olympic weight lifting and gymnastics with movements involving kettlebells, rowing machines and skipping ropes — a program of “constantly varied, high-intensity functional fitness,” as Mr. Glassman originally described it.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Early fans of CrossFit’s workouts included members of law enforcement and the military, associating it with grit and mental toughness. Mr. Glassman did not exactly stifle that perception: Speaking about CrossFit to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/fashion/thursdaystyles/getting-fit-even-if-it-kills-you.html" title="">The New York Times</a> in 2005, he said, “If the notion of falling off the rings and breaking your neck is so foreign to you, then we don’t want you in our ranks.”</p><p>But part of CrossFit’s appeal was that the workouts, though sometimes extremely demanding, could be adapted to accommodate almost anyone: while one athlete might be asked to jump onto a 30-inch box, another could step onto a raised platform, achieving the same stimulus with different intensity.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Marine Creek Lake in Fort Worth, Tex., where the swim competition took place.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Amanda Mccoy/Star-Telegram, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>That accessibility helped CrossFit <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/crossfit-book-breathe-fire/" title="">grow rapidly through the 2000s and 2010s,</a> even as some people saw its exercises as hazardous for amateurs. An early, ironic brand mascot was “Uncle Rhabdo,” a vomiting clown <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rhabdomyolysis-and-whats-its-connection-to-crossfit-75623" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">named after the potentially deadly muscle condition that CrossFit has sometimes been known to cause</a>.</p><p>The devotion it inspired helped it outlast shorter-lived fitness fads. CrossFit popularized the concept of “high-intensity interval training” and spawned many imitators, including OrangeTheory, Barry’s Bootcamp and F45. If you’ve ever done kettlebell swings, wall ball shots or jump rope double-unders, you have felt the influence of CrossFit, which has reshaped the way countless Americans exercise.</p></div></div><div><div><p>After Mr. Glassman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/style/crossfit-sold-greg-glassman.html" title="">sold</a> the company in 2020 in the wake of scandal, CrossFit has shifted its messaging to further emphasize accessibility, abandoning its former motto, “Forging Elite Fitness.” The company has been trying to emphasize its openness to beginners, returning to Mr. Glassman’s theory that “the needs of the Olympian and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind.”</p><p>But CrossFit the workout and the CrossFit Games are meant to be different.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/movies/crossfit-documentaries.html" title="">CrossFit Games</a>, a competition for super-elite athletes, have been held annually since 2007. The Games were conceived “as a marketing effort at a time when the company didn’t have a marketing department,” said Adrian Bozman, CrossFit’s competition director. Over the years they have become the subject of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/movies/crossfit-documentaries.html" title="">popular documentary films</a> and a must-see event for fans.</p><p>The ostensible purpose of the CrossFit Games is to test the fittest on earth by challenging them to conquer “the unknown and the unknowable,” for which CrossFit is meant to prepare them. The Games include heightened versions of common CrossFit movements, such as heavy barbell snatches or bar muscle-ups, as well as more unusual tasks, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=69Q7ucG_u4Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leaping over hay bales</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z9ONaQyIhw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swinging a sledgehammer</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqIio2Ssm1Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tossing a medicine ball in a sit-up</a>.<span>  </span>Outdoor swimming events, though relatively common at the Games, would never be performed in a CrossFit class.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A CrossFit gym in England.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">John Walton/PA Images, via Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Still, some top CrossFit athletes have said that the Games often push competitors too far, exceeding what’s necessary to test fitness. During an outdoor event at the 2015 Games, several participants passed out because of heat exhaustion. Chris Hinshaw, the one-time coach of Mat Fraser, who has won the Games multiple times, has <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a38525354/crossfit-games-mat-fraser-almost-drowned-chris-hinshaw-mark-bell/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described</a> how Mr. Fraser nearly drowned during a swimming event in 2017.</p><p>“We’ve been talking about our safety concerns for a long time, and it’s fallen on deaf ears,” said Pat Vellner, a veteran CrossFit Games competitor. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Questions about the safety of the competition quickly resurfaced after Mr. Dukic’s death. Some people took issue with the decision to hold an outdoor run and swim in Texas in August, when the <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/fort-worth/article290887514.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">water temperatures</a> were allegedly unsafe; others wondered whether enough lifeguards and safety personnel had been on the scene.</p><p>The morning after Mr. Dukic died, Dave Castro, CrossFit’s director of sport and the programmer of the Games, said in an interview that safety “is always taken into consideration.” Mr. Castro declined repeated requests for a follow-up interview.</p><p>When Mr. Dukic died, the rest of that day’s events were canceled. But the next day, after hours of internal deliberation and consultations with other athletes and with Mr. Dukic’s family, organizers decided to proceed with a modified version of the competition schedule.</p><p>“We spent a lot of time talking about this, and we were clear that the decision needed to be about how to honor him,” said Don Faul, CrossFit’s current chief executive. “If we felt like the appropriate way to honor him was to cancel the Games, then we absolutely were going to cancel the Games.”</p><p>Of the 80 individuals in the competition, 13 immediately withdrew because of the decision to continue the Games. (Those who quit at that time included Jeffrey Adler and Laura Horvath, the Games’s reigning male and female champions.) More athletes continued to withdraw from the event as it continued, including Arielle Loewen.</p><p>“It felt wrong to go on the competition floor and pretend like everything was fine, pretend like everything was OK, pretend like the show must go on, when this is a tragedy and we should treat it as such,” Ms. Loewen said.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Professional Fitness Athletes’ Association, a group that includes CrossFit Games athletes Brent Fikowski, Annie Thorisdottir and Mr. Vellner, has called for the removal of Mr. Castro from his position as director of sport, suggesting the degree to which athletes hold the programming responsible for Mr. Dukic’s death.”</p><p>Tia-Clair Toomey, 31, the seven-time champion from Australia, chose to stay in the competition because having gotten to know Mr. Dukic by participating in past Games, she believed “that’s what he would have done himself.”</p><p>Ms. Toomey added that she thought “Dave and his team try to make every event as safe as possible.’”</p><p>The reactions among CrossFit fans were similarly divided. Rob LaLonde, a gym owner from Ottawa, who was at the Games, said that he was experiencing “a whirlwind of not knowing what to feel or think” but added that he was glad the Games were continuing.</p><p>Thea Andreasdottir, a CrossFit athlete from Germany, said she had “never been more affected by the death of someone I don’t actually know.” She placed the blame for Mr. Dukic’s death squarely on the organization.</p><p>Mr. Vellner, the veteran CrossFit Games competitor, hoped the tragedy would prompt a sort of reckoning among CrossFit leaders. But, he said, “the fear is that at the end of this there’s no accountability.”</p><p>Whether the death of an elite CrossFit Games athlete will deter other athletes from competing, or will stop casual exercisers from walking into their local CrossFit gyms, remains to be seen. Most long-time CrossFitters understand that the Games are very different from the fitness methodology, and that what happens at one doesn’t reflect the other. But will that be clear to outsiders?</p></div></div><div><div><p>Danielle Brandon, 28, who participated in her sixth CrossFit Games this year, was among the athletes who chose to keep competing. She said that she has always felt safe in the competition despite “the risk of doing sport.”</p><p>“I mean, CrossFit itself — it’s kind of crazy, right?” Ms. Brandon said while warming up for a Games event that included sprinting, toes-to-bar and 70-pound-dumbbell snatches. “What’s so safe about putting a heavy dumbbell over your head?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>D</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>4</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>  Safety Debate Erupts After a Death at the CrossFit Games<span>. <a href="https://www.parsintl.com/publication/the-new-york-times/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/22/style/crossfit-games-death-crisis.html">44</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/08/22/style/crossfit-games-death-crisis.html">44</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
