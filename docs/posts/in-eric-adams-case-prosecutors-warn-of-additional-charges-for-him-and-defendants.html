    <h1>In Eric Adams Case, Prosecutors Warn of Additional Charges for Him and Defendants</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Less than a week after Mayor Eric Adams pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery and fraud, federal prosecutors told a judge that they might bring additional charges against him and that charges against other people are “likely.”</p><p>“There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">several related investigations</a> here,” Hagan Cordell Scotten, a prosecutor with the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, said during a hearing in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday.</p><p>The hearing was the most recent step in the case against Mr. Adams, the first sitting mayor in modern New York City history to be indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Adams, 64, has denied the allegations detailed in a five-count indictment that prosecutors revealed last week. He faces charges of bribery conspiracy, fraud and soliciting illegal campaign donations.</p><p>The mayor, a former Brooklyn borough president and police captain, is accused of accepting luxury travel for years before becoming the Democratic nominee for mayor and of pressuring the Fire Department to sign off on the opening of a new high-rise Turkish Consulate building in Midtown Manhattan after he was elected.</p></div></div>
