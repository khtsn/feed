She was 88.</p><p>Her death, at a hospital, was confirmed by her son Michael Miller.</p><p>After publishing several books in the 1970s and ’80s about the changing nature of childhood, Ms. Winn began writing a column on mother nature for The Wall Street Journal in 1989, a career turn that eventually put her at the center of an only-in-New-York-City melodrama.</p><p>It began in Central Park, where Ms. Winn started bird watching in 1991, the year an unusual-looking red-tailed hawk arrived from places unknown.</p><p>Instead of the dark brown features that typically mark red-tail hawks, this one had light-colored plumage. Ms. Winn named the curious fellow Pale Male. She and other bird watchers of Central Park — “the Regulars,” as Ms. Winn called them — followed him everywhere.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Shortly after his arrival in Central Park,” she wrote in her book <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/winn-love.html?scp=46&amp;sq=park%20vs.%20park&amp;st=cse" title="">“Red-Tails in Love: A Wildlife Drama in Central Park”</a> (1998), “Pale Male had discovered a hunting ground that was to become his favorite: an area near the park entrance at Fifth Avenue and 79th Street — the killing corner, as the Regulars dubbed it.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Winn originally wrote about Pale Male in a nature column for The Wall Street Journal.

Pale Male watched from a chimney.</p><p>“Peering down intently, Pale Male would search out one that was imperceptibly slower, clumsier, stupider,” Ms. Winn wrote. “Then he would plummet down in that breathtaking dive falconers call a stoop. Bingo.”</p><p>Pale Male liked the neighborhood so much that he decided to settle at 927 Fifth Avenue, a 12-story luxury apartment building near the corner of East 74th Street. The building, which has a view of Central Park, was also home to the actress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/television/mary-tyler-moore-dead.html" title="">Mary Tyler Moore</a>. Pale Male did most of his mating on the 12th-floor cornice. He also occasionally vacationed at a building nearby, on Woody Allen’s penthouse terrace.</p><p>Ms. Winn and “the Regulars” were consumed by Pale Male’s romantic life, naming his succession of girlfriends First Love, Chocolate and Blue. The birders sat on a bench outside the park with binoculars waiting for action, shouting, “They’re doing it!” when they were doing it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>There was heartbreak, too. First Love “ate a poisoned pigeon and died on a ledge of the Metropolitan Museum,” Ms. Winn wrote in The Wall Street Journal. Chocolate, she added, died in “a collision on the New Jersey Turnpike.”</p><p>But perhaps the most lamentable event in Pale Male’s life occurred in December 2004, when the co-op board at 927 Fifth Avenue, fed up with rat carcasses and bird droppings falling to the building’s front sidewalk, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/08/nyregion/new-york-celebrities-evicted-on-fifth-ave-feathers-and-all.html" title="">voted to remove Pale Male’s nest</a>, upending his courtship of his new consort, Lola.</p><p>Protests outside the building attracted national media attention.</p><p>“I’m restraining myself, Margot, from being obscene,” Ms. Winn <a href="https://www.npr.org/2004/12/10/4213496/nyc-hawks-evicted-from-fifth-ave-perch" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on NPR</a>’s “All Things Considered,” addressing the interviewer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/business/margot-adler-68-journalist-and-priestess-dies.html" title="">Margot Adler</a>. “I’m so angry about this.”</p><p>So was Mary Tyler Moore.</p><p>“These birds just kept coming back to the edge of the building, and people kept coming back to see them,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/08/nyregion/new-york-celebrities-evicted-on-fifth-ave-feathers-and-all.html" title="">told</a> The New York Times, adding, “This was something we like to talk about: a kinder, gentler world, and now it’s gone.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>New York City residents expressed their dismay via the 2004 version of Twitter — letters to the editor.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>New Yorkers complained in letters to the editor in 2004, when a co-op board voted to remove Pale Male’s nest from its building.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The hawks were “all about location, location, location: what a view they had of the park, and what a view we had of them,” Matthew Wills of Brooklyn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/10/opinion/new-york-was-his-nest-and-then-871460.html?timespastHighlight=hawks,nest" title="">wrote</a> to The Times. “Like those who destroy a landmark in the middle of the night, those responsible for destroying the nest at 927 Fifth Avenue have shown their contempt for the city they call home.”</p><p>A week later, in response to pressure from the National Audubon Society, the co-op board reversed its decision. On the morning of Dec. 28, workers removed an apparatus on the landing that had prevented the hawks from alighting.</p><p>“In no time at all Pale Male and Lola landed on the nest site,” Ms. Winn wrote. “Later that afternoon Lola was seen bringing a new twig to the nest.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Pale Male in 2005 at 927 Fifth Avenue, the building where he settled and mated.
