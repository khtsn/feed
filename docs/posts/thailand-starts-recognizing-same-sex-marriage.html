Rungtiwa Thangkanopast wore a long white dress, and her partner, Phanlavee Chongtangsattam, a black tuxedo.</p><p>Officials welcomed them. But when they reached the registrar’s desk and presented their identity cards, which show each to be female, they were turned away. Marriage between two women, they were told, was not permitted.</p><p>On Thursday, the couple finally had the chance to wed under Thailand’s new law allowing same-sex marriages. They joined hundreds of others for a mass wedding ceremony in Bangkok as the law took effect.</p><p>“I am delighted and excited because we have been waiting for this day for a very long time,” Ms. Rungtiwa said. “For 20 years, we have loved each other and have had to hide from society’s disapproval. But now we can stand proudly.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The mass wedding ceremony began in the morning at Paragon Hall, an event and convention center in one of Bangkok’s biggest shopping malls, Siam Paragon. It was hosted by a rights group, Naruemit Pride, whose name roughly translates to creating pride.</p><p>Dozens of officials and scores of journalists were on hand as the first weddings began in a large charcoal-gray hall, with flower-bedecked pink arches set up as backdrops for the newlyweds’ photos. The couples were wed one at a time by officials who examined their documents and formally registered them as legally married.</p><p>“Today we feel secure and safe and happy,” said Ploynaplus Chirasukon, 33, who wed her partner, Kwanporn Kongpetch, 32, in the event’s first marriage. “We are happy that we have played a part in the equal marriage law reaching this point.”</p><p>Other weddings were planned around the country, and organizers say they expect more than 1,000 same-sex couples to marry on the first day.</p><p>With the new law, Thailand becomes the first country in Southeast Asia — and only the third place in Asia after Taiwan and Nepal — to allow people of the same gender to marry each other.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Thailand is widely seen by foreigners as one of the more open places in the world for L.G.B.T.Q. people, but it took more than a decade of campaigning to legalize same-sex marriage. Many citizens of this traditional, predominantly Buddhist country remain conservative, especially older people. Even so, it is becoming increasingly tolerant on social issues, particularly in contrast to its neighbors.</p><p>In 2022, Thailand became the first nation in the region to legalize the sale and recreational use of marijuana. The government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/world/asia/thailand-legal-weed-plant.html" title="">gave away 1 million marijuana plants</a> to households as the law took effect. Since then, hundreds of weed shops have sprung up in urban areas. And last year, Parliament passed the marriage legislation, which became law with the king’s assent.</p><p>To celebrate the law, Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, presided over a colorful photo shoot last week with dozens of couples planning to marry.</p><p>“Jan. 23, 2025, will be the day that we all record history together, that the rainbow flag has been planted gracefully in Thailand,” she posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DE2LBeDTjoA/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=43b63fdb-a833-4823-b958-baef30f94a59" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on her Instagram account</a>. “Everyone’s love is legally recognized with honor and dignity.”</p><p>Thailand, whose economy depends heavily on tourism, plans to begin promoting itself internationally as an L.G.B.T.Q. tourist destination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Among those planning to get married at the Bangkok ceremony were Amnad Sanghong, a manager at an import-export company, and Aphinun Manasang, a graphic designer, who have been together for 14 years.</p><p>Like many other couples, Mr. Amnad, 42, and Mr. Aphinun, 37, are motivated to marry to obtain full legal rights, including the right to make health care decisions for a loved one, and to receive the benefit of Thailand’s adoption and inheritance laws.</p><p>They came to Bangkok to be part of the first-day celebration and will hold another wedding ceremony with family and friends when they return home to Prachinburi Province, about 70 miles northeast of the city.</p><p>“Our families are very excited because they never expected us to be able to marry,” Mr. Aphinun said.</p><p>In 2013, when Ms. Rungtiwa, 59, and Ms. Phanlavee, 44, were turned away from the wedding ceremony, few Thais were advocating same-sex marriages.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“No one had the courage at that time to come out and demand their rights,” Ms. Phanlavee said. “The costumes were only a symbol because we knew we wouldn’t be allowed to register. They were a symbol to say that we are life partners.”</p><p>Their quest to get married started with a family health scare that made them realize they lacked the legal right to authorize care for those they considered immediate family members.</p><p>Afterward, they began trying to secure their rights through various legal maneuvers.</p><p>Their daughter, Chomchanok Thangkanopast, was born 24 years ago to Ms. Rungtiwa and her then-husband, who has since died. They knew when they married that they were gay. Both wanted a baby.</p><p>A few years later, Ms. Rungtiwa met Ms. Phanlavee and fell in love. They began living together, and though both considered Ms. Chomchanok to be their daughter, Ms. Phanlavee did not have parental rights. The couple reached a roundabout solution: Ms. Rungtiwa’s mother adopted Ms. Phanlavee, legally making her a sister to her partner and an aunt to their daughter.</p><p>When Ms. Chomchanok turned 20, Ms. Phanlavee adopted her without legal barriers.</p><p>“I am still the aunt, but I am also the mom,” Ms. Phanlavee said.</p><p>Now, with the chance to get married, their lives will be much simpler, at least in legal terms.</p><p>“Even though the society will not accept us,” said Ms. Rungtiwa, “at least the law will accept us.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Richard C.
