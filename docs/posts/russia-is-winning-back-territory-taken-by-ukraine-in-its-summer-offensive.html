It took Russia several weeks to stabilize the situation by sending in reinforcements to halt the Ukrainian advance. Military analysts and U.S. officials said Russia’s response was initially slow and scattered as the Kremlin determined which military and security forces should lead the counterattacks.</p><p>Then, in mid-September, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kursk.html" title="">Russia launched a first wave of counterattacks</a> that allowed its troops to capture at least one village, Snagost, and several other settlements located on the western flank of the Ukrainian bulge.</p><p>It launched a second wave of assaults last week, pushing further on the western flank and reclaiming about 20 square miles of territory, according to <a href="https://x.com/Pouletvolant3/status/1845756786789228594" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">independent experts</a> tracking the Russian advance based on geolocated combat footage. They have now recaptured the village of Novoivanovka and have reached the outskirts of the village of Olgovka.</p><p>Ukrainian officials and soldiers have generally been tight-lipped about the situation in the Kursk region in order to preserve operational security. “The fighting is intense, and the situation is constantly changing,” Andrii Kovalenko, a senior Ukrainian official focused on Russian disinformation, <a href="https://t.me/akovalenko1989/8085" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> on Saturday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Kastehelmi said that “it’s clear that the Ukrainian lines don’t seem to hold very well.”</p><p>He noted that Ukraine’s army does not appear yet to have built any large-scale fortifications in the area, complicating its defense, and added that the western flank currently under Russian attack consists of relatively open terrain, with few urban centers that the Ukrainians can use to entrench themselves in.</p><p>The <a href="https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-11-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of War</a>, a Washington-based think tank, said last week that the Russian military may have intensified its assaults in the Kursk region before rainy weather in the fall and winter make the terrain muddy and therefore less practicable for assaults with armored vehicles, leaving more time for the Ukrainians to fortify their positions in the area.</p><p>“Russian forces may perceive a closing window of opportunity to eliminate the Ukrainian incursion” into the Kursk region, the institute said.</p><p>Whether Ukraine will manage to hold on to the territory it controls in the Kursk region remains to be seen.</p><p>The Ukrainian offensive there has stretched its human and matériel resources, which are sorely needed elsewhere on the front to fend off Russian attacks that continue unabated. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A senior U.S. military official said early this month, before Russia’s latest counterattacks, that Ukraine would be able to maintain its position there for “several months and potentially beyond” because Moscow suffers from logistical issues and disorganization of the command structure in the area. He spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security issues.</p><p>Ukraine might hope to use the territory it holds in the Kursk region as a bargaining chip in peace negotiations, to trade for land seized by Russia in Ukraine. But Moscow has yet to signal any willingness to engage in talks while it has the upper hand on the battlefield.</p><p>Eric Schmitt<!-- --> contributed reporting from Washington.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
