influencer level last week when Khaby Lame, the world’s most-followed person on TikTok, was detained by U.S. immigration agents in Las Vegas and then left the United States.</p><p>Mr. Lame, an Italian-Senegalese man who has over 160 million followers, was detained on Friday at Harry Reid International Airport, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, said in a statement.</p><p>Another Gen Z influencer, Bo Loudon, a teenager who is also a pro-Trump activist, took credit for Mr. Lame’s removal.</p><p>“I discovered that he was an illegal,” Mr. Loudon, who has said he is best friends with President Trump’s son Barron, and whose Instagram feed is filled with thumbs-up photos alongside the president and his entourage, <a href="https://x.com/BoLoudon/status/1931118528213741843" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “And I personally took action to have him deported,” he added.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Lame, who has made his name by posting wordless, comic videos on TikTok, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The detention came amid a spike in ICE enforcement since President Trump took office, with the president’s crackdown also becoming powerful ammunition in fights between social media superstars.</p><p>Mr. Lame, 25, who was born in Senegal but has lived in Italy since the age of 1, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/style/khaby-lame-tiktok.html" title="">became famous</a> by responding to viral and often absurdly complicated life-hack videos with easy-to-understand reaction clips in which he would do the same task in a much simpler manner.</p><p>As his following grew, he signed partnerships with fashion brands, made a cameo appearance in a Hollywood movie and starred in a TV show, “Khaby Is Coming To America,” on the streaming service Tubi, depicting his travels across the United States.</p><p>In recent months, said his former lawyer, Riccardo Lanzo, Mr. Lame had spent a significant amount of time in the United States, although he was unsure about his visa situation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>According to a statement by ICE, Mr. Lame entered the United States on April 30 and overstayed the terms of his visa. He was granted voluntary departure on Friday and has since left the country.</p><p>Mr. Loudon, who helped President Trump reach young voters, said in an interview with Dylan Page, an online streamer, that Mr. Lame “had worked with a few of my friends,” who told him Mr. Lame was staying in the country illegally.</p><p>“I just called some buddies in the administration,” Mr. Loudon said. “And I’ve never seen anything happen so quick.”</p><p>Mr. Loudon also accused Mr. Lame of being a “far left influencer” and of disliking President Trump, though there is no obvious indication that Mr. Lame openly took political stances.</p><p>Mr. Loudon declined a New York Times request for an interview but referred The Times to the Dylan Page interview.</p><p>Mr. Lame, who has not publicly commented on the events, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, but he continued to post content on social media, including an Instagram story from São Paulo, Brazil, on Monday.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma Bubola is a Times reporter based in Rome.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
