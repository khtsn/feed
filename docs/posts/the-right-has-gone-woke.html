    <h1>The Right Has Gone Woke</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Language policing. Cancel culture. Victimhood contests and cultural grievances. Despite attacking the left for partaking in such practices, there’s an emerging set of individuals on the right who have became exactly what they’ve criticized. Meet the woke right.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Thank you, President Trump, for ending a scourge that’s plagued our nation for far too long. We’ve gotten rid of the woke. Woke no longer. Just kidding. The truth is, wokeness is actually alive and well. Let’s take the Mexico out of the Gulf. Put America on it. When you see someone celebrating Charlie’s murder, call their employer. It’s kind of tough navigating the real world as a straight, white male now. Wokeness just wears a MAGA hat. This is the woke. They’re now going around policing people’s language. They’ve limited what federal agencies are allowed to mention in their documents, such as these dangerous words. These are among scores of seemingly innocuous words that have been scrubbed from the government lexicon. And journalists who refer to the Gulf of America as the Gulf of Mexico are getting their credentials rescinded because the woke right loves telling people what to say when it comes to historical landscapes. Change Denali’s name to Mount McKinley. And it’s not just individual words. The woke right’s language. Police claimed their mission was to defend free speech, to immediately stop all government censorship. So they’re protecting free speech by revoking the visas of numerous international students who were part of pro-palestinian demonstrations. And books are being taken out of libraries and schools because they mention gay and trans people or people of color. If you do commit any crimes, the language police deems a threat to society like criticizing anything MAGA, MAGA gang, Donald Trump, they will try to cancel you. And it’s not just lefty celebrities they’ve canceled canceled respected four star General Mark Milley by removing his portrait from the Pentagon. General Milley, who I know is a lazy guy, and they temporarily removed any mention of Jackie Robinson from the Pentagon’s website amid the administration’s efforts to append DEI. And they renamed a Naval ship that was named after veteran Harvey Milk because he was also a gay rights activist. We are taking the politics out of ship naming. So the woke right believes their version of cancel culture is making the world a safer place by protecting innocent civilians from the dangers of the woke rebrand. Woke rebrand, rejecting what they see as a redneck old image. White people are about to riot and saving us from businesses that publicly support the gay community. What the hell is going on at Target. And I think it should go beyond simply a boycott. So while the woke right criticizes the woke left for its victim mentality, especially if you’re a minority who couldn’t seem to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, the woke right declares the real victims are now people of the Christian faith white, heterosexual men. Because we all systemic oppression like racism and misogyny, affects straight white men the most. Wokeness started as a means of calling for social justice within the Black community, but it transformed the left into a divisive, exclusionary culture. The right has turned it into a tool of authoritarianism. Either way, when each side has moral purity tests, victimhood contests, and public shaming, we lose the ability to unite on a common cause and see one another as people.</p></dd></dl></div></div>
