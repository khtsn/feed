    <h1>G2 completes Americas treble after 3-0 win against NRG</h1>

		<p>G2 Esports has defeated NRG 3-0 in the Americas Stage 2 grand final, winning their third-straight Americas trophy. They will go to Champions: Paris as the top Americas seed, and await for the conclusion of the group draw to learn their opponents in the top VCT event.</p>

<p>The match opened on G2&#39;s pick, Bind, with NRG going up in the first half. A classic 9-3 curse followed, however, as G2 recovered to win the map 13-11.</p>

<p>G2 remained in control during Lotus, for a less close result on their opponent&#39;s map. G2 went up 7-5 in the first half, and a round winstreak after the break helped them reach match point. NRG briefly delayed the inevitable, but G2 ultimately ended the map 13-8, one game away from a perfect regional season.</p>

<p>The final map would be Ascent, where G2 took a strong lead despite their relatively defensive composition. NRG came close to equalizing, looking for a comeback, but G2 was able to deny them recovery to win the third map 13-10.</p>

<p>The victory comes after ups-and-downs for G2, having had to replace veteran player leaf with BABYBAY earlier this stage, as well as capping off a redemption year after a relatively dry spell in 2024 after Ascension.</p>

<p>Both teams will return in a few weeks to represent Americas in Paris. Joining them will be Sentinels and MIBR, who qualified off of points thanks to their performance throughout the season.</p>
