</span> 3-0 in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530913/g2-esports-vs-nrg-vct-2025-americas-stage-2-gf" target="_blank">Americas Stage 2 grand final</a>, winning their third-straight Americas trophy. They will go to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2283/valorant-champions-2025" target="_blank">Champions: Paris</a> as the top Americas seed, where <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542332/champions-paris-groups-opening-matches-drawn" target="_blank">they will play in Group D</a>. NRG, meanwhile, was unable to claim their first-ever VCT Americas title, but will return for Champions, playing in Group C.</p>

<p>This match is the second with <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> back in competition after he had to temporarily step back for personal reasons. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/519234/babybay-stands-in-for-leaf-for-stage-2" target="_blank">BABYBAY took over</a> in his stead, helping G2 reach the upper final with his Sentinel play. </p>

<p>Due to G2 having entered VCT Americas via Ascension, this match was only the fourth time the teams played against each other. G2 had been dominant in previous encounters, only losing one map <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/536680/sentinels-and-g2-go-the-distance-to-set-up-upper-final-rematch" target="_blank">earlier in the Stage 2 playoffs bracket</a>.</p>

<p>The match opened on G2&#39;s pick, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530913/g2-esports-vs-nrg-vct-2025-americas-stage-2-gf/?game=231383&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Bind</a>, where G2 had been playing their signature Tejo. It was a slow start for G2 on attack, with NRG&#39;s Controller duo helping keep G2 at bay. After a 9-3 half, a pistol win and back-to-back multikills from <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> started a chain of round wins, as G2 was unrelenting on their way to taking the lead and securing double digits. NRG was able to win a couple of rounds and keep the score close, but in the end, G2 closed out their map 13-11.</p>

<p><em>G2 mounted a comeback on Bind to take their map.</em></p>

<p>NRG&#39;s pick, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530913/g2-esports-vs-nrg-vct-2025-americas-stage-2-gf/?game=231384&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>, continued the series. G2 remained in control, extending their defensive prowess to go up 7-5 in the first half. Initiator duo <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4581/jonahp">
		JonahP	</a>
</span> and trent helped secure the first half, and G2 was by far the better team in opening engagements. </p>

<p>After the break, a pistol win and a following round streak led G2 to map point, a night-and-day showing compared to previous attacking efforts from both teams in this series. NRG briefly delayed the inevitable, but G2 ultimately ended the map 13-8, one game away from a perfect regional season.</p>

<p><em>Grand final MVP <span data-ref-id="5">

</span> was stellar throughout the series.</em></p>

<p>The final map would be <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/530913/g2-esports-vs-nrg-vct-2025-americas-stage-2-gf/?game=231385&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Ascent</a>, where G2 took a strong lead despite a relatively defensive composition. The Chamber-Vyse combination had been deceptive for other teams in the past, but G2 had had a seven-map winning streak on Ascent with this selection. After losing the pistol, G2 won a series of rounds before NRG saw another point. This led to a G2 win in the first half, as the map went to halftime 7-5 in G2&#39;s favor. </p>

<p><em><span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/7873/leaf">
		leaf	</a>
</span> picked up where he left off to help his team earn the title.</em></p>

<p>Having had a momentary respite, NRG came close to equalizing, looking for a comeback, but G2 was looking to end the series without extending it unnecessarily. They avoided a tie after losing the bonus, and were able to deny them enough rounds to win the third map 13-10 and take the series 3-0.</p>

<p>This win marks G2&#39;s third Americas win, as well as their third regional trophy of the year. The Ascension team&#39;s redemption following a trophy-less 2024 could now only be capped off with Champions: Paris, as G2 looks to establish one of the more dominant seasons in the VCT partnership era. </p>

<p>Both teams will return in a few weeks to represent Americas in Paris. Joining them will be <span data-ref-id="7">
