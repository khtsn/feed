Gov. Kathy Hochul is also under increasing pressure to remove him from office.</p><p>The four officials who are expected to resign are all respected government veterans. Ms. Torres-Springer was elevated to the second most powerful job at City Hall in October in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/nyregion/eric-adams-administration.html" title="">effort to stabilize city government</a> and restore confidence in his administration following the mayor’s federal indictment in September on five corruption counts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The departure of Mr. Parker is particularly pointed because he is the deputy mayor for public safety and has been deeply involved in issues around the city’s role in the president’s deportation plans.</p><p>The intended resignations were first reported by WNBC.</p><p>“As we always say, if and when we have personnel announcements to make, we will make them,” said Kayla Mamelak-Altus, a spokeswoman for the mayor.</p><p>Reached by phone on Monday, Ms. Williams-Isom declined to comment. Ms. Joshi, Ms. Torres-Springer and Mr. Parker could not be reached for comment.</p><p><em>This is a developing story that will be updated.</em></p><p>Jeffery C.
