If you get a water bill, ask your utility company whether your property is serviced by lead lines.</p><p>Lead pipes are more likely found in older cities, like Chicago, New York, Detroit and Milwaukee, and in homes built before 1986, when the use of lead in new plumbing was banned.</p><p>If you have trouble getting information that way, there are several other steps you can take to figure things out yourself:</p><h3 id="link-62ecce89"><span>Start with the water meter and check the color of the pipe</span></h3><p>Locate your water meter. That could be in your basement, garage, in your yard, or even on the sidewalk. Then, examine the service line. That’s the pipe coming into the water meter. Is it made of metal or plastic?</p><p>If it looks like it’s made of metal, determine what kind. One way is to take a key or coin to gently scratch the pipe. (Use work gloves to do this.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Take a look at the color of the pipe. If it’s orange, it’s copper. If it’s gray, but hard to scratch, it could be galvanized steel, which you can check by seeing if a magnet sticks to the pipe.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>If the metal pipe is easily scratched, and a magnet doesn’t stick to it, there’s a strong possibility it’s made of lead.</p><h3 id="link-61cd6fc8"><span>Replace the problematic pipes</span></h3><p>If your home is serviced by lead pipes, it’s important that you get them replaced as quickly as possible and that you take some protective steps.</p><p>Contact your water utility, a licensed plumber, or your city or county, to ask about replacement programs. Billions of dollars in federal and state funding are being made available for lead pipe replacement. There could be a long waiting period, though.</p><p>If you have the financial means and prefer to pay your own way, consult a plumber. But keep in mind that replacement costs can come to thousands of dollars. The actual work should take only a day or two.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h3 id="link-20e45b2e"><span>Reduce your exposure</span></h3><p>In the meantime, take steps to reduce you and your family’s lead exposure.</p><p>Before using water for drinking or cooking, run your tap at a high volume to flush the line. Try to use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula, because lead dissolves more easily in hot water. Remember that boiling water can kill of germs, but it won’t get rid of lead.</p><p>Clean your faucet’s aerator, or the little screen attached where the water comes out. Consider installing a water filter that is <a href="https://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certified to remove lead</a>.</p><p>If you’re concerned about you or your family’s blood lead levels, consult your family doctor or pediatrician about testing. You can also get your water tested for lead, and you can find <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwlabcert/contact-information-certification-programs-and-certified-laboratories-drinking-water" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a certified lab</a> on the E.P.A. website.</p><p>But the bottom line: If you suspect your home has lead pipes, you should get them replaced.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Hiroko Tabuchi covers pollution and the environment for The Times.
