    <h1>Liz Cheney to Campaign With Harris at the Birthplace of the G.O.P.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I’m as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built, from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks in between,” said Mr. Walz, name-checking the left-wing senator from Vermont and the world’s biggest pop music star. “And they don’t all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people.”</p><p>Ms. Cheney is a Wisconsin native who grew up in Virginia and represented Wyoming in Congress for six years. After Mr. Trump tried to overthrow the 2020 election results, she disowned him and participated in the House select committee investigating the Trump-inspired assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. She so alienated fellow Wyoming Republicans that she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/us/politics/harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-wyoming.html" title="">run out of office</a> by a primary challenger loyal to Mr. Trump.</p><p>“As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” Ms. Cheney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/politics/liz-cheney-kamala-harris-vote.html" title="">told</a> an audience at Duke University in North Carolina last month.</p><p>Since becoming the Democratic nominee, Ms. Harris has tacked toward the center, trying to shed her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html" title="">reputation</a> as a California liberal by repudiating many of the progressive positions she held when she ran for president in 2020.</p><p>This time around, she has described herself as a committed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/harris-economic-speech-pro-business.html" title="">capitalist</a>,” laid out a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/harris-border-immigration-arizona.html" title="">hard-line position</a> on border security and embraced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/business/energy-environment/pennsylvania-fracking-natural-gas-trump-harris.html" title="">fracking</a> to extract natural gas from under Pennsylvania — a position she opposed during her first presidential campaign. Polls have shown that voters are more worried that Ms. Harris is too liberal than that Mr. Trump — who has proposed a series of radical right-wing policies — is too conservative.</p></div></div>
