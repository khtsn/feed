Trump and his politics. Their event will take place in Ripon, Wis., the site of a series of meetings that helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/us/politics/wisconsin-politics.html" title="">lead to the foundation of the G.O.P. in 1854</a>.</p><p>The two women agree on little politically beyond their distaste for Mr. Trump. They had next to no relationship when they overlapped in Congress, though they did speak on the phone about Ms. Cheney’s endorsement earlier this summer.</p><p>The endorsement by Ms. Cheney — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/us/politics/dick-cheney-kamala-harris.html" title="">that of her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney</a> — is meant to show the breadth of Ms. Harris’s support, a point that her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, made in his debate against Senator JD Vance of Ohio on Tuesday night.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I’m as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built, from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks in between,” said Mr. Walz, name-checking the left-wing senator from Vermont and the world’s biggest pop music star. “And they don’t all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people.”</p><p>Ms. Cheney is a Wisconsin native who grew up in Virginia and represented Wyoming in Congress for six years. After Mr. Trump tried to overthrow the 2020 election results, she disowned him and participated in the House select committee investigating the Trump-inspired assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. She so alienated fellow Wyoming Republicans that she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/us/politics/harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-wyoming.html" title="">run out of office</a> by a primary challenger loyal to Mr. Trump.</p><p>“As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” Ms. Cheney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/us/politics/liz-cheney-kamala-harris-vote.html" title="">told</a> an audience at Duke University in North Carolina last month.</p><p>Her appearance for Ms. Harris will be especially striking because of the timing: New evidence in the federal criminal case against Mr. Trump over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/trump-jan-6-case-jack-smith-evidence.html" title="">became public on Wednesday in a 165-page brief</a> from the special counsel, Jack Smith. In the final weeks of the presidential race, the details drew new attention to Mr. Trump’s actions surrounding Jan. 6 — a politically advantageous development for Ms. Harris at a time when the growing conflict in the Middle East and the dockworkers’ strike <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/harris-israel-iran-helene-port-strike.html" title="">have become cause for concern</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Since becoming the Democratic nominee, Ms. Harris has tacked toward the center, trying to shed her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html" title="">reputation</a> as a California liberal by repudiating many of the progressive positions she held when she ran for president in 2020.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>This time around, she has described herself as a committed “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/harris-economic-speech-pro-business.html" title="">capitalist</a>,” laid out a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/harris-border-immigration-arizona.html" title="">hard-line position</a> on border security and embraced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/business/energy-environment/pennsylvania-fracking-natural-gas-trump-harris.html" title="">fracking</a> to extract natural gas from under Pennsylvania — a position she opposed during her first presidential campaign. Polls have shown that voters are more worried that Ms. Harris is too liberal than that Mr. Trump — who has proposed a series of radical right-wing policies — is too conservative.</p><p>Wisconsin is seen as a must-win state for Ms. Harris, along with Michigan, where she will campaign on Friday, and Pennsylvania, where she has appeared more than any other battleground. Ms. Harris has built a narrow lead in Wisconsin, rapidly recovering from President Biden’s deficit against Mr. Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-wisconsin.html" title="">according to a New York Times polling average</a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey from Marquette Law School</a> released Wednesday found that 71 percent of Wisconsin Democrats were enthusiastic about voting among in the presidential election — up from 40 percent in June, when Mr. Biden was still in the race.</p><p>Ms. Harris has also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/republican-officials-harris-endorsement.html" title="">endorsed</a> by more than 100 former national security officials from Republican administrations and former Republican members of Congress.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Nicholas Nehamas is a Times political reporter covering the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-nehamas">More about Nicholas Nehamas</a></span></p></div><div><p>Reid J.
