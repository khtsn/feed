In Dublin, where the actress, comedian and former talk show host has been staying since mid-January, afternoon light streamed through a nearby window. The cello came with the rental.</p><p>Lots of celebrities talked during the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections about moving abroad if Donald J. Trump won — among them, Barbra Streisand, Cher, and Amy Schumer.</p><p>Ms. O’Donnell actually went through with it.</p><p>“I never thought he would win again,” she said of President Trump, bringing up the television clips she watched last year of Kamala Harris, then the vice president, appearing at packed arenas in Pennsylvania and Michigan. “But I said, ‘If he does, I’m going to move,’ and my therapist said, ‘Well, let’s make a real plan.’”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It so happens that Ms. O’Donnell had reservations about discussing all this with a reporter.</p><p>Her application for Irish citizenship has not yet been approved and she is worried about doing anything to jeopardize that. Technically, she and her youngest child, Clay, who is autistic and nonbinary, are still just visiting the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-3"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rosie O’Donnell is staying in Dublin while applying for Irish citizenship.

On it, she talked about her new life in the country, hurled some insults at Mr. Trump and gave every indication that she would be remaining over there for the foreseeable future.</p><p>But much of her focus at the moment is on the documentary, which was inspired partly by, of all things, her unlikely relationship with Lyle Menendez, the convicted murderer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><h2 id="link-3ff1889f">Finding the Good in People</h2><p>Ms. O’Donnell, of course, has been feuding with Mr. Trump since 2006, when she joined “The View,” a chatfest created by the anchorwoman Barbara Walters.</p><p>On the show, in response to what she felt was Mr. Trump’s receiving overly positive coverage for his treatment of a controversy involving a Miss USA contestant, Ms. O’Donnell mocked Mr. Trump, flipping her hair over her face and delivering a withering impersonation while questioning his role as a moral arbiter and a successful businessman.</p><p>Mr. Trump threatened to sue “The View” and Ms. Walters personally. Ms. Walters got on the phone with him to smooth things over. Soon enough, Mr. Trump was appearing all over cable news calling Ms. O’Donnell “wacko” and “fat,” and he said Ms. Walters personally told him that she regretted hiring Ms. O’Donnell.</p><p>The year after, despite soaring ratings, Ms. O’Donnell left the show. But her feud with Mr. Trump never ended. She became a fixture and a punchline in the supermarket tabloids, which she always suspected, but was unable to prove, was the work of Mr. Trump and Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer who went to prison after pleading guilty to campaign-finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud.</p><p>While incarcerated at the federal correctional facility in Otisville, N.Y., Mr. Cohen received what he said in a phone interview on Friday was a letter from Ms. O’Donnell. “It was so heartwarming and compassionate I actually thought I was being punked,” he said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/style/michael-cohen-rosie-odonnell-friendship.html" title="">She then visited Mr. Cohen in prison</a> and was in touch with him in the days before Mr. Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It may seem like a case of politics making strange bedfellows, but it was pretty typical behavior for Ms. O’Donnell, who has a habit of finding the good in controversial people.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12ST-ROSIE-ODONNELL-01-tkjc/12ST-ROSIE-ODONNELL-01-tkjc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12ST-ROSIE-ODONNELL-01-tkjc/12ST-ROSIE-ODONNELL-01-tkjc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/12/multimedia/12ST-ROSIE-ODONNELL-01-tkjc/12ST-ROSIE-ODONNELL-01-tkjc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Two men sit in a courtroom.

Ms. O’Donnell reached out to Ms. England during her 2005 trial, believing that she was being turned into a scapegoat for the injustices of the Iraq war.</p><p>And there is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/us/politics/reality-winner-is-released.html" title="">Reality Winner</a>, the former military contractor who pleaded guilty to felony transmission of national defense information after leaking classified documents about Russian interference in the 2016 election to The Intercept, a nonprofit news site. During the trial, Ms. O’Donnell got in touch with Ms. Winner’s mother, Billie Winner-Davis, and later had Ms. Winner on her podcast.</p><p>But no friendship of Ms. O’Donnell’s is more surprising than the one she has with Lyle Menendez, who along with his brother, Erik, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 slaying of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez.</p><p>While the brothers were on trial in 1996, Ms. O’Donnell gave an interview on “Larry King Live” in which she said that she believed the brothers had been molested as children and that the murders were, in some way, an act of self-defense.</p><p>Soon after, she received a letter from Lyle Menendez.</p><p>In it, he thanked her for her support and stated his belief that she “knew” from a personal place that what he was saying was true. Ms. O’Donnell did: She said she and her siblings had been molested by their father.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But she did not reach out to him then.</p><p>“At that point, I had not ventured anywhere near this in my family or in my therapy,” she said last week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-13"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In 2022, after watching a documentary about the Menendez brothers, Ms. O’Donnell discussed their case on TikTok, reiterating her belief that they were sexual abuse survivors who killed their parents out of a sense of trauma and desperation.</p><p>Soon after, she said, Lyle Menendez’s wife, Rebecca Sneed, reached out to her to see if she was interested in speaking with him.</p><p>Their first conversation lasted two or three hours, Ms. O’Donnell said.</p><p>“Then he started calling me on a regular basis from the tablet phone thing they have,” she said. “He would tell me about his life, what he’s been doing in prison and, for the first time in my life, I felt safe enough to trust and be vulnerable and love a straight man.”</p><p>Some of her friends expressed concern. “They were like, ‘Ro, he’s a murderer,’” she said.</p><p>She shrugged, then went to visit him in prison, where she saw scores of inmates with Labrador retrievers stationed silently at their feet.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. O’Donnell has enjoyed her time in Ireland so far, and is staying busy by promoting the documentary “Unleashing Hope: The Power of Service Dogs for Autism.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ellius Grace for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Ms. O’Donnell asked Mr. Menendez how this could possibly be legal and he told her about a program they had to train and place dogs with blind, disabled veterans and autistic children. He suggested Ms. O’Donnell get a dog for Clay through the program.</p><p>Ms. O’Donnell said she felt uneasy at first. Clay is a highly verbal child and Ms. O’Donnell, aware of her celebrity status, did not want to jump in front of someone who could not function without a highly trained service dog. But Mr. Menendez told her not to worry: The dogs were distributed according to need.</p><p>A year later, she was approved for a dog.</p><p>Ms. O’Donnell spent two weeks commuting daily to the prison, where she was matched with Kuma, a black Labrador mix who had been trained for a year by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carlos.aguirre780" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carlos Aguirre</a>, an inmate doing time for armed robbery. (Although the dog winds up working principally with the autistic child, the intensive training takes place between the dog and an adult.)</p><p>Kuma bonded instantly with Clay when she came home. “I noticed the difference in Clay immediately,” she said. “I was shocked to find out that all the stories I heard from other mothers of autistic children were true.”</p><p>So Ms. O’Donnell decided to film a short documentary about the program. The result of that, which was produced by Hilary Estey McLoughlin and Terrence Noonan — veterans of her late-1990s talk show — will be released on Hulu on April 22.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><h2 id="link-3390af58">Adjusting to a New Life</h2><p>While the documentary was filming, Ms. O’Donnell read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/trump-project-2025.html" title="">Project 2025</a>, a document created by the Heritage Foundation that laid out a right-wing agenda for a potential second Trump term. She believed Mr. Trump when he said he would be a dictator on Day 1, and she did not believe him when he said Project 2025 reflected anything other than a specific plan for what he would do as president.</p><p>“World tragic events have always wiped me out emotionally,” she said. “I believe it stemmed from watching the Vietnam War on television as a little kid during dinner and seeing unbearably graphic horror on the news.”</p><p>The first Trump term was debilitating for her.</p><p>“I was unbelievably heavy, I was drinking too much,” she said. “But there were guardrails.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. O’Donnell, who sang with Broadway performers at a demonstration outside the White House in 2018, has long been vocal about her distaste for Mr. Trump.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Erin Schaff for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In the campaign’s final weeks, she made preparations. Just in case.</p><p>“I got my passport renewed, I got Clay’s passport renewed,” she said. “My brother has his passport. All my cousins have their passports. But I was never a traveler.”</p><p>So moving to Ireland felt strange, though she has been pleasantly surprised by how much she likes it.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>“I see reflections of myself in this country everywhere I look, and reflections of my family and my very Irish childhood,” she said. “We’re 100 percent Irish. Being Irish Catholic was a very big part of my identity, and coming back here does feel like coming home in a way that’s hard to explain or understand, even for me.”</p><p>The people, she said, are unusually friendly. When they approach her in public, they do so in a way that feels “1,000 percent different than in the United States.”</p><p>There was an uncomfortable moment, however, when she watched Micheál Martin, the prime minister of Ireland, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/takeaways-ireland-martin-trump-tariffs.html" title="">meet with Mr. Trump at the Oval Office</a> during a televised appearance.</p><p>There, Brian Glenn, a reporter from the right-wing news outlet Real America’s Voice and the boyfriend of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, asked Mr. Martin why he was allowing Ms. O’Donnell to move there when all she could do was “bring unhappiness” to the country.</p><p>Mr. Martin seemed to wince in his chair. But he was able to avoid the question because Mr. Trump jumped in to say what a good question that was and went about insulting Ms. O’Donnell himself.</p><p>Afterward, Ms. O’Donnell sent Mr. Martin a letter saying how embarrassed she was to have become a topic of conversation during what should have been a serious meeting. He has not responded.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>It was yet another chapter in a feud with Mr. Trump that has been going for nearly 20 years. But given Ms. O’Donnell’s seeming ability to forge relationships with various castaways, criminals and other notorious people, it seemed fair to ask: Could she see any good residing in him?</p><p>“None,” she said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jacob Bernstein reports on power and privilege for the Style section.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/rosie-odonnell">Rosie O&#39;Donnell</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/lyle-menendez">Lyle Menendez</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> Stock Market Comments: </strong>President Trump urged his social media audience to invest in the stock market just hours before pausing most of his reciprocal tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-stock-market.html">raising questions among government ethics experts</a> about market manipulation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robert F.
