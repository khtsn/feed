But owners of smaller farms and independent producers who grow fresh fruits and vegetables or raise livestock have expressed concern that the distribution of funding will only deepen the consolidation of an industry that has <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/8FD0D821-C3B7-3888-9623-5E9C0E770291#8627AAD7-5A76-3E15-A247-6FB3D5AC6B10" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost over 300,000 farms</a> in the past two decades.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The monies are not flowing to small- and medium-sized family farms,” said Vincent H. Smith, an agricultural economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. “They’re flowing overwhelmingly to the largest producers.”</p><p>The bulk of the funding — more than $50 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office — will go toward increasing payments to farmers enrolled in <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/resources/programs/arc-plc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">price and revenue support programs</a> covering 22 commodity crops, or major crops like corn and soybeans. The law also makes an additional 30 million acres of land available for the programs. Another provision, worth about $6 billion, increases subsidies for crop insurance.</p><p>Under the revenue support programs, the government doles out payments if market prices of a particular crop drop below a certain level determined by law, known as a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12047" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“reference price.”</a> The new law increases reference prices by 10 to 20 percent depending on the crop, with peanuts, rice and cotton seeing the largest bumps. Altogether, farmers of those crops, which are concentrated in the South, are expected to see the biggest benefits.</p><p>Farmers who raise these crops say the changes will be a lifeline in difficult times, staving off the threat of food imports and preventing farm bankruptcies.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It’ll help me survive,” LG Raun, who grows rice on 2,200 acres in eastern Texas, said one morning this month as he waited for the dew to evaporate so he could start his harvest.</p><p>Mr. Raun noted that his own cost of production had increased by 40 percent since 2014, when fixed reference prices were last updated. The Texas rice belt was also battered by two years of drought before Hurricane Beryl struck last summer, by one estimate reducing yields by <a href="https://www.farmprogress.com/rice/rice-industry-benefits-from-new-research-center" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25 percent</a>. And the Agriculture Department has forecast another decline in rice prices <a href="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/outlooks/112594/RCS-25D.pdf?v=96486" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this year</a>, the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rice-yearbook" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third in a row</a>.</p><p>Mr. Raun, who is also a board member of USA Rice Farmers, a trade group, said he knew of several farmers who had taken on additional debt to weather financial losses. Despite the increased reference price for his crop, Mr. Raun said he would still be short on cash. “I will still lose money for this year,” he said. “It truly is a safety net because it doesn’t make you whole.”</p><p>But for farmers who do not grow covered commodities, the law may worsen existing challenges.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The bulk of the funding — more than $50 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office — will go toward increasing payments to farmers enrolled in price and revenue support programs covering 22 commodity crops.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Texas rice belt was battered by two years of drought before Hurricane Beryl struck last summer, reducing yields by 25 percent, by one estimate.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Bryce Loewen, who grows peaches, plums and other fruits on a 78-acre farm in the Central Valley of California, said he was not eligible for the programs receiving a vast majority of the funding increases in the new law.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Instead, he anticipates losing revenue as a result of another aspect of the law, one that makes sharp cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps. At least six regular customers rely on food stamps to purchase from his farmers’ market stall, Mr. Loewen estimated, and he expects that peaches — a “luxury item if you’re trying to make your dollars stretch” — will be one of the first products that beneficiaries forgo.</p><p>“Taking that away not only hurts the people that really kind of need the assistance the most, it also is going to affect farms like ours that benefit financially,” he said.</p><p>“Another thing about this bill that’s so upsetting is it really picks and chooses where that assistance is going,” Mr. Loewen added. “And at least in my reading of it, it almost exclusively is helping large ag.”</p><p>Even as farm and commodity groups <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/ag-sector-reacts-to-senate-s-passage-of-reconciliation-bill-11765157" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">applauded</a> the law’s increased funding for subsidy programs, a number of critics agreed with Mr. Loewen’s assessment.</p><p>The influential Farm Bureau called the agricultural provisions “<a href="https://www.fb.org/news-release/farm-bureau-applauds-senate-passage-of-one-big-beautiful-bill" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">desperately needed</a>.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Farmers who raise commodity crops say the changes will be a lifeline in difficult times, staving off food imports and preventing farm bankruptcies.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But the National Family Farm Coalition, which supports smaller farms, warned that the law was short sighted, unnecessarily favoring large corporations. The law “perpetuates a decades-long decline of forward-thinking food and farm policy that has undermined independent agricultural producers to benefit corporate agribusinesses,” the group said in a <a href="https://nffc.net/2025-big-bogus-bill-pr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>About a quarter of the 880 million acres of farmland in the United States is enrolled in the two price-support programs. But because payments are made per acre and thus scale up with production, the programs disproportionately benefit the wealthiest.</p><p>Though large family farms — those making $1 million or more annually — and corporate farms amounted to less than 8 percent of all farms in the United States, they received about 47 percent of subsidy payments and 67 percent of crop insurance payments in 2024, <a href="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/publications/110560/EIB-283.pdf?v=76883#page=15" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Agriculture Department.</a> The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy group, <a href="https://farm.ewg.org/progdetail.php?fips=00000&amp;progcode=totalfarm&amp;page=conc&amp;yr=2024&amp;regionname=theUnitedStates" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the top 20 percent of farm subsidy recipients in 2024 received 80 percent of payments.</p><p>Payments to the largest and wealthiest will only increase under the new law, experts said. Other provisions in the law raise the annual maximum amount paid to farmers, lifting <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/tools/informational/payment-eligibility/adjusted-gross-income" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a previous income cap</a> of $900,000 and removing a requirement for recipients to be “actively engaged in farming.”</p><p>These changes will “send millions of dollars to absentee owners living in the middle of America’s biggest cities,” Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group, said in a news conference last month.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Jonathan Coppess, a policy analyst at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is a co-author of the analysis of payments by county, warned of the consequences. Altogether, he said, the law most “likely has an impact on consolidation at the local level, as those farmers with more payments can drive up cash rents and land prices, running smaller farmers out of business.”</p></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-16"><figure aria-label="media" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/23/multimedia/00dc-agriculture-vwkg/00dc-agriculture-vwkg-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/23/multimedia/00dc-agriculture-vwkg/00dc-agriculture-vwkg-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/07/23/145077_1_00dc-agriculture-82911_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>At 71, Mr. Raun said that he did not expect to expand his farm any further, and that the bump in reference prices would not provide him with enough cash to do so, anyway. But he insisted that downsizing or remaining small was not an option for many rice farmers: “We’re having to get larger, because you can’t farm 100 acres or 200 acres and even afford a tractor to plant the crop,” he said.</p><p>Faced with fluctuating global prices and competition from rice farmers in Southeast Asia and India, Mr. Raun said that farm subsidies kept operations like his from going out of business, regardless of their size.</p><p>“We’re not paying farmers unless they get into a desperate situation,” he said, adding: “If we’re doing good, government doesn’t come in and subsidize this. It only does when we could go broke.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>July 30, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this article misidentified Jonathan Coppess’s occupation.
