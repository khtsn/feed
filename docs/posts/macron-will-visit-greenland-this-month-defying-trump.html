The trip was drastically scaled back and confined to a remote military base after the threat of local protests.</p><p>The French announcement did not allude to Mr. Trump or the United States, but it was clear that the intent and symbolism of the visit is that Greenland, a vast and mineral-rich island, is not there for the taking on the whim of an American president. Early this year, France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, <a href="https://www.sudradio.fr/linvite-politique/israel-on-ne-sait-pas-si-ofer-kalderon-et-ohad-yahalomi-sont-vivants-affirme-jean-noel-barrot" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered to send troops</a> to help defend the island. Denmark demurred.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Macron will be the first foreign head of state to visit Greenland since President Trump embarked on his annexation campaign this year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ludovic Marin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Mr. Macron will stop in Greenland on his way to the Group of 7 meeting in Canada that runs from June 15 to 17. Mr. Trump has also suggested that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/canada/trump-trudeau-canada-51st-state.html" title="">Canada should be absorbed into the United States as the 51st state</a>, so the French president will be traveling from one of Mr. Trump’s targets for American territorial expansion to another.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The announcement said that discussions among the three leaders in Greenland would also focus on “climate change, energy transition and security in the supply of critical minerals.”</p><p>Greenland, with a population of 56,000, is rich in rare earth minerals that are vital to high-tech industries and a target of increasingly fierce competition. China, which dominates in the world’s critical minerals, has severely restricted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html?searchResultPosition=12" title="">the export of certain minerals</a> to the United States. According to <a href="https://data.geus.dk/gpub-landingpage/?id=32049" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent Danish study</a>, 31 of the 34 materials that the European Union defines as critical, including lithium and titanium, are found on the island.</p><p>Mr. Macron has long argued for “European strategic autonomy” and has appeared vindicated by Mr. Trump’s often dismissive or contemptuous view of Europe. The French leader has argued for the urgent necessity of European “rearmament” in the military sense, and also in the sense of a mental reset that casts aside the pacifism of past decades.</p><p>His relationship with Mr. Trump, forged during the American president’s first term, is friendly on the surface — they call each other regularly — but subject to tensions that stem from their often adversarial world views.</p><p>Mr. Macron is a strong supporter of the European Union, which Mr. Trump has dismissed as an anti-American creation designed to “screw” Washington, and a strong opponent of far-right political forces in Europe that Mr. Trump has embraced.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The G7 meeting will afford an opportunity to air their differences, which may well be accentuated by Mr. Macron’s decision to visit Greenland. The visit is likely to play well in France as an assertion of French and European defiance at a time when Mr. Macron finds himself largely paralyzed on the domestic front by a deadlocked Parliament.</p><p>In Denmark, and throughout Europe and in Greenland itself, Mr. Trump’s attempt to take over the island has provoked outrage, even if some Greenlanders have expressed interest in closer cooperation with the United States. A <a href="https://www.veriangroup.com/da/insights/opinionsmaling-groenland-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent opinion poll</a> found that 85 percent of Greenlanders do not want to join the United States, though many Greenlanders do want independence from Denmark eventually.</p><p>In early March, a political party that has taken a cool stance toward America won first place in Greenland’s parliamentary elections. That party has drawn close to Denmark as a bulwark against the United States.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Roger Cohen is the Paris Bureau chief for The Times, covering France and beyond.
