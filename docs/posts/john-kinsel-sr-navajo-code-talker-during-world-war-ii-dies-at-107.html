He was 107.</p><p>Buu Nygren, president of the Navajo Nation, announced Mr. Kinsel’s death in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1097522379041379&amp;set=a.424256173034673" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on social media. No cause was given.</p><p>An estimated 400 Navajo Code Talkers served during World War II, transmitting a code crafted from the Navajo language that U.S. forces used to confuse the Japanese and communicate troop movements, enemy positions and other critical battlefield information. Mr. Kinsel, who served from October 1942 to January 1946, was part of the second group of Marines trained as code talkers at Camp Elliott in California, after the original 29 who developed the code for wartime use.</p><p>The code was never broken. A fictionalized version of the codetalkers’ story was depicted in the film <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/15/movies/when-navajos-fought-japanese-for-ne-he-mah.html" title="">“Windtalkers,”</a> directed by John Woo.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/08/29/navajo-code-talker-john-kinsel-sr-ww-2/1958740001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interview in 2019 with The Arizona Republic,</a> Mr. Kinsel remembered training alongside 25 other marines at Camp Elliott, and he recalled working with some of the original 29 to develop additional code, including by working on code words for military words like “tank” and “aircraft.”</p><p>Mr. Kinsel was assigned to the Ninth Marine Regiment, Third Marine Division, and took part in the battles of Bougainville (in Papau New Guinea), Guam and Iwo Jima. He was never deployed to the front lines, <a href="https://news.va.gov/85511/veteranoftheday-marine-veteran-john-kinsel-sr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,</a> but he worked with his division headquarters while on Bougainville Island to develop code and transcribe messages.</p><p>“That’s how I spent the war,” <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/08/29/navajo-code-talker-john-kinsel-sr-ww-2/1958740001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Kinsel said</a> in the interview with The Arizona Republic.</p><p>The Associated Press reported that the only two surviving Navajo Code Talkers are Thomas H.

He completed boot camp and was sent to Camp Elliott, where he underwent training to become a Navajo Code Talker.</p><p>He was sent to New Zealand, where he trained for eight more months before being deployed to Guadalcanal, one of the Solomon Islands, with the Third Marine Division, according to the <a href="https://news.va.gov/85511/veteranoftheday-marine-veteran-john-kinsel-sr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>. His first combat experience was the Battle of Bougainville.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They often sent out messages about troop movements, Mr. Kinsel told the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/afc2001001.54894/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in an interview in 2003</a>.</p><p>“We sent out jump-offs every night,” Mr. Kinsel said. “That means what time the front lines are going to move. It’s not always the same time — it’s always a different time. It might be four o’clock in the morning; it might be 6:15. In Navajo you said, ‘It’s time to jump.’”</p><p>In the interview for the Veterans History Project, Mr. Kinsel recalled how, on March 2, 1945, he and his group didn’t listen to a warning that the Japanese were going to bomb their location in Iwo Jima. Around 11:30 p.m., Mr. Kinsel and his equipment were rocked by an explosion that broke his leg, he said. Mr. Kinsel received a Purple Heart in 1989, according to the <a href="https://news.va.gov/85511/veteranoftheday-marine-veteran-john-kinsel-sr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>.</p><p>He was sent back to Guam for a few months and returned to San Diego around Christmas in 1945. He was honorably discharged on Jan. 1, 1946, according to the <a href="https://news.va.gov/85511/veteranoftheday-marine-veteran-john-kinsel-sr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/08/29/navajo-code-talker-john-kinsel-sr-ww-2/1958740001/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the interview with The Arizona Republic</a>, Mr. Kinsel said his mother had a Navajo medicine man come over to perform a ceremony for his return.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“He prayed for me and performed a night ceremony,” Kinsel said in Navajo to the Republic. “Then I returned to being a Navajo, we were given back to the Navajo.”</p><p>In 2001, he received a Congressional Silver Medal for his service.</p><p>Mr. Kinsel is survived by his son, Ronald Kinsel. A full list of survivors was not immediately available.</p><p>All flags in the Navajo Nation were to be lowered to half-staff from sunrise on Sunday until sunset next Sunday, Oct. 27, Mr. Nygren said in a statement.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
