</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>One of those staying put is Justin Burgess, 44, who works at a pizza place in Seattle. The pandemic put him out of work for a few months, but federal relief payments gave him enough money to invest in the stock market for the first time, and pay down credit card debt.</p><p>Now getting by has gotten harder, as rent on the house he shares with friends has risen, and he has spent down that small savings cushion. Even as Seattle’s minimum wage has risen — it’s now $17.25 an hour for smaller businesses with tipped workers like Mr. Burgess — he doesn’t feel he’s seeing much benefit.</p><p>“People are beginning to resent the whole tip system, so we’re making less in tips, and I’m living check to check still,” Mr. Burgess said. Just recently, his management notified the staff that 2.5 percent would be deducted from tips to cover credit card swipe fees. </p><p>Food service and drinking places, like the one where Mr. Burgess works, added about 30,000 jobs in August, but the industry has barely surpassed its prepandemic level after a slow recovery.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The only other sectors adding significant numbers of jobs were health and other categories of care, which gained 44,000 jobs, and construction, which was up by 34,000 jobs — another month of surprisingly robust growth two years into a cycle of elevated interest rates that has made financing new projects more difficult.</p><p>Support for that construction has come from federal aid packages for airports, transportation infrastructure and clean energy installations. Rebecca Fountain, who runs <a href="https://www.korbg.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a construction firm</a> in Las Vegas, has been winning some of those government bids. The volume of new opportunities has been perplexing to Ms. Fountain and her industry colleagues.</p><p>“We see there’s some kind of slowdown coming, and yet we’re getting all kinds of work now,” she said. “We’re not quite sure what to think other than, ‘Get the contracts and start building as soon as possible so they can’t rescind them.’”</p><p>Like many employers in Las Vegas, Ms. Fountain uses workers supplied by a local union, which means she doesn’t have to recruit and pays a flat hourly rate. But the hiring hall has been stretched thin in recent months, she said, and sometimes sends people with less experience than she would like.</p><p>That squares with <a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/Files/Communications/2024_Workforce_Survey_Analysis.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveys collected by</a> the Associated General Contractors, a trade group, which found that its union-shop members are now having just as hard a time filling roles as their nonunion members — especially for positions requiring a high degree of skill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The wave of immigrants who have arrived over the southern border in recent years may be helping to satisfy that appetite for workers, since most of them gain employment authorization within six months. Adam Kamins, a senior director with Moody’s Analytics, notes that migrants have found their way to big cities and agricultural areas like the Central Valley of California, allowing production to continue when it might otherwise have halted.</p><p>“I think they are generally ending up in places where the need for workers is more pronounced,” Mr. Kamins said. “This influx of new workers into the economy has allowed us to bring inflation under control, but do so in a way that hasn’t been as painful as it might have been otherwise.”</p><p>One notable weak spot is manufacturing, which has been mostly flat since late 2022 and contracted by 24,000 jobs in August. Outside federally subsidized investments in battery and semiconductor plants that have generally not started operating, high interest rates have weighed on new investment, while the strong dollar has depressed exports.</p><p>The impending election also has companies putting off big decisions, given the large policy changes that could result if the White House or Congress changes hands, said Timothy Fiore, the Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Business Committee chair.</p><p>“We’ve pretty much run out of the order book,” Mr. Fiore said, “and in the absence of new orders coming in, we have companies stepping down their production plans.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lydia DePillis reports on the American economy.
