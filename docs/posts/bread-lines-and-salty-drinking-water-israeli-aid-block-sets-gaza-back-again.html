But no one was listening.</p><p>Just a few steps away, scalpers were hawking loaves they had gotten earlier that day for three times the original price. The sunset meal that breaks Muslims’ daylong fast during the holy month of Ramadan was approaching and across Gaza, bread, water, cooking gas and other basics were hard to come by — once again.</p><p>Lines had not been this desperate, nor markets this empty, since before the Israel-Hamas cease-fire took hold on Jan. 19.

Shortages of fresh vegetables and fruit and rising prices are forcing people to once again fall back on canned food such as beans.</p><p>Though the canned food provides calories, experts say, people — and children in particular — need a diverse diet that includes fresh foods to stave off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/middleeast/gaza-famine-starvation-children.html" title="">malnutrition</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/15/multimedia/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/15/multimedia/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/15/multimedia/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="An adult and two children sit near a small cooking flame amid piles of rubble and personal possessions." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/15/multimedia/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/15/multimedia/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/15/multimedia/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/15/multimedia/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq/15gaza-aid-01-jlkq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/66a5c617-7dc2-5169-a74c-a5b9734308ea" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A family preparing food to break the daytime fast for the holy month of Ramadan in the rubble of their destroyed home in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, this month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Children filling water bottles in Gaza City last month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>For the first six weeks of the cease-fire, aid workers and traders delivered food for Gazans, many still weak from months of malnutrition.

Some wells are still functioning in central Gaza, aid officials say, but they supply only brackish water, which poses long-term health risks to those who drink it.</p><p>Israel had already closed off all other sources of electricity that it used to provide for Gaza, a measure that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that began the war. That left essential services to run on solar panels or generators, if power was available at all.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Now there is no fuel coming in for anything, including generators, ambulances or cars.</p><p>Israel argues that about 25,000 truckloads of aid that Gaza has received in recent weeks have given people sufficient food.</p><p>“There is no shortage of essential products in the strip whatsoever,” the Foreign Ministry <a href="https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/1897362068291936448" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said last week</a>.

That has already forced six bakeries in Gaza to close and aid groups and community kitchens to reduce the food rations they hand out.</p><p>The order to block aid also cut off Gaza’s access to commercial goods imported by traders.</p><p>In the city of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, a street market was quiet this week as the vendors’ stocks of fruits, vegetables, oil, sugar and flour ran low. Vegetable sellers said the price of onions and carrots had doubled, zucchini had nearly quadrupled and lemons cost nearly 10 times as much. Eggplants were hard to find and potatoes impossible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Food handouts in Beit Lahiya this week.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Palestinian man carrying food aid back to his family in northern Gaza last month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>As a result, the sellers said, the few customers who still came bought only a couple of vegetables, not by the kilogram as many once did.

They have seven children, a disabled sister and two aging parents to support.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>It had been hard enough to afford the bare minimum of ingredients for iftar, the meal that breaks the daily fast during Ramadan, Ms. al-Attar said. But with fuel blocked, it was also getting tough to find fuel for her husband’s car and for cooking.</p><p>“Just three days ago, I felt a little relief because prices seemed reasonable,” she said. Now, the same money would only be enough for a much smaller quantity of vegetables.</p><p>“How can this possibly be enough for my big family?” she said.</p><p>That night, she said, they would probably make do with lentil soup, with no vegetables. And after that? Maybe more canned food.</p><p>Stall owners and shoppers alike blamed large-scale traders for the shortages, at least in part, saying they were hoarding supplies to push up prices and maximize their profits. Any vegetables available at reasonable prices were being snapped up and resold for much more, said Eissa Fayyad, 32, a vegetable seller in Deir al-Balah.</p><p>It did not help that people rushed out to buy more than they needed as soon as they heard about the Israeli decision to blockade aid again, said Khalil Reziq, 38, a police officer in the city of Khan Younis in central Gaza whose division oversees markets and shops.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians returning to their homes in northern Gaza last month.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Palestinian family setting up a tent beside their destroyed home in northern Gaza.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Hamas police officers have warned businesses against price-gouging, vendors and shoppers said.
