A compact man with a penchant for fastidious tailoring, Mr. Assouline recalled that books — at least the kind that find their resting places on coffee tables or on carefully curated and color-coordinated shelves — sold at the time for a relative pittance of $60 to $75. Mr. Assouline was quick to see an opportunity, confecting a special edition on the Indian state of Rajasthan printed on cotton and wrapped by hand in an antique sari. Its price was a then-astronomic $600, or about $2,000 today.</p><p>“It was truly a couture book,” said Robert Burke, a former Bergdorf executive turned luxury consultant who today counts Assouline among his clients. “We sold them as fast as Prosper could wrap them,” Mr. Burke recalled.</p><p>Steep prices and increasingly lavish productions seem in line with a time-tested retail axiom: At the high end of the marketplace, you are only as valued as the company you keep.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It’s a principle guiding the company even now. The Assoulines — Prosper and Martine, the French married founders, and their 30-year-old son, Alexandre — produce and sell titles, some 2,000 in the 30 years since its founding.

A special edition on Versailles, presented in a velvet clamshell, and priced at $4,900, is offered with a private tour of the château’s interior.

Consumer spending has risen, with an average order value up 13 percent over the past three years.

The company also acts as its own distributor, a strategy to maintain scarcity and an image of exclusivity. “There will be no discounts, no overruns,” Alex Assouline said.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Assouline operates 18 free-standing stores worldwide, including Maison Assouline, its gilded London flagship, and a second flagship set to open next month in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, spanning 10,000 square feet that includes an upscale restaurant. It also occupies boutique spaces in hotels like the Plaza Athénée in Paris and the Peninsula in Hong Kong.</p><p>The brand’s latest outpost, an independent boutique on Madison Avenue at 62nd street in New York, shares a city block with Kiton, Hermès and John Lobb, and accommodates a small bar and outdoor cafe. Its interior, a colorful but somewhat austere amalgam of marble-top consoles, Persian carpeting, and statuary and towering bookcases, does not invite casual browsing.</p><p>Its shelves are pristinely arrayed with books from the company’s popular travel series — Miami, Provence and Dubai, among others — and the small, relatively affordable monographs on Dior, Alaia and other household fashion names on which the brand built its early success.</p><p>Those shelves groan as well with special editions like “Rare Cars: The World’s Most Exclusive Rides”; “Golf,” housed in a golf ball textured metal clamshell; and “Chanel, the Impossible Collection ($1,050).</p><p>A customer hoping to examine one of these rarefied <em>objets</em> is promptly greeted by an attendant who heaves it from its resting place and offers a pair of white cotton gloves with which to leaf through its contents, a practice in keeping with the brand’s mission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“We are not just about commercial success,” Alex Assouline said. “We bring artistry and intellect to shopping.”</p><p>An exalted claim for sure, but one in tune with perceived consumer appetites. Illustrated books, publishers’ preferred term for the kinds of coffee table volumes often displayed in the offices of doctors, wealth management firms and corporate libraries, are “cultural eye candy,” said Milton Pedraza, the chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a New York-based consumer research and consulting firm. They confer on “connoisseurs, or would be connoisseurs, a whiff of prestige,” he said.</p><p>Mr. Pedraza, who furnished an Assouline library for his client Genesis House, an agglomeration of showrooms and restaurants in Manhattan, added, “They represent stealth wealth, intended to tell you what your hosts are about and to provide visual evidence: that the owners are people of wealth, education and taste.”</p><p>As Charles Miers, the longtime publisher of Rizzoli New York and its imprints, pointed out, “These books help identify the owner; rather than attesting to the owners’ intellectual curiosity, he said, “they speak to social hipness and fashionability.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Chanel, the Impossible Collection,” one of the books devoted to fashion brands, is priced at $1,050.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hugues Laurent for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Books from the company’s popular travel series cover Miami, Provence and Dubai, among others.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Hugues Laurent for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>An early poster child for this trend, Mr. Miers recalled, was Rizzoli’s “Tom Ford,” with a forward by Anna Wintour. Released in 2004, and priced at $140, the book is selling as robustly now, he said, as it did 20 years ago.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“Retail space in hotels, restaurants, clubs and even upscale gyms like Equinox, have become very important to us,” Mr. Miers added. “About 50 percent of our sales are outside regular bookstore channels.”</p><p>Not to be overlooked, however, are the lavishly produced illustrated books that make up a significant portion of some independent booksellers’ inventory and floor space.</p><p>“The illustrated books segment of the market is extremely healthy,” said Mitchell Kaplan, the founder and owner of Books &amp; Books in Miami, with upscale outposts in Bal Harbour and Coral Gables. These art and photography books make up some 50 percent of our stores’ retail space, he said. “They are very easily our special sauce.”</p><p>Among the stores’ most successful volumes are Assouline travel books, purchased as souvenirs and acting as catnip on armchair travelers. “These people want to be part of the world, whether it’s the Sistine Chapel or the Louvre or Versailles,” Mr. Kaplan said. Assouline limited editions, including a $1,200 tome on motorcycles, remain popular, he added. “People are buying them as design elements for their homes.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Well apprised of this growing trend, associated with the notion of shelf wealth, Assouline is intent on expanding its library services and on making incursions into the lifestyle arena, such as home fragrances and pricey bibelots.</p><p>The company — whose wares included home fragrances and which has curated libraries for corporate clients, including the condominium complex at 277 Fifth Avenue and the Caledonia, a luxury apartment building in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan — plans to provide a similar service for private collectors. “We will curate and design not just your bookcase but, working with contractors, your carpet and your office table,” Alex Assouline said, adding assertively, “We are an interior designer.”</p><p>But some say not so fast. As Mr. Pedraza of the Luxury Institute noted, “It remains to be seen how interior design fits with the brand’s ethos and ambitions. Furniture is a crowded space, with formidable risks, production and logistics among them. For Assouline, this is a Hail Mary pass.”</p><p>Such cautions are unlikely to dissuade the younger Mr. Assouline. “We want to package culture where culture meets luxury,” he said. “A well-appointed library is part of that.”</p><p>Hubris or brashly canny marketing? Mr. Assouline evades such distinctions. “In this sphere,” he declared, “we aim to become the authority.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ruth La Ferla is a reporter in the Style section of The Times whose coverage ranges across fashion, influential personalities and societal trends.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ruth-la-ferla">More about Ruth La Ferla</a></span></p></div></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Fueling Trump’s Rise: </strong>The producers of “The Apprentice” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/business/donald-trump-apprentice.html">crafted a TV version of Donald Trump</a> — measured, thoughtful and endlessly wealthy — that ultimately paved his path to the White House.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Crackup of Red Lobster</strong>: Here’s how missed opportunities, a $1.5 billion real estate deal, all-you-can-eat shrimp and the global pandemic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/business/red-lobster-seafood-downfall.html">sank America’s largest seafood chain</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elon Musk’s Security Apparatus: </strong>As threats to his safety have become graver, the world’s richest man has barricaded himself behind a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/technology/elon-musk-security.html">phalanx of bodyguards that operates like a mini-Secret Service</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cashing In on Cowboy Culture: </strong>Lands in cities and towns that were once stockyards can be low-lying, unfavorable and often prone to flooding. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/business/stockyards-redevelopment.html">They’re also hotbeds for new developments</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Sports Memorabilia Gold Mine: </strong>In 2021, a businessman bought a collection of roughly 20 million sports cards from its reclusive owner. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/business/sports-memorabilia-collection-discovery.html">Now he wants to show it to the world</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
