Jerry Maguire boosts his clients. Daniel Kaffee wants the truth, whether or not he can handle it. Maverick feels a need — a need for speed.</p><p>In real life, Cruise, 62, has enthusiastically cast himself as the great champion of cinema. You can almost hear the deep-voice narration over the trailer: In a time when movies are endangered after a pandemic and the streaming age, one man stands up for old-fashioned filmmaking — with stark stories and real stunts intended for the Cineplex.</p><p>In 2020, during the first Covid summer, Cruise posted <a href="https://x.com/TomCruise/status/1298336338434052096" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> to social media of going to Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” (“Big Movie. Big Screen. Loved it”). An introduction ran before screenings of “Top Gun: Maverick” in the spring of 2022 in which Cruise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WvT8uTOa5o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thanked</a> audiences for “seeing it on the big screen.” As Cruise put it in another short video: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3QOQ-skVJs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I love my popcorn.</a> Movies. Popcorn.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>As he invariably does in his movies, Cruise has succeeded. “You saved Hollywood’s ass!” Steven Spielberg <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/steven-spielberg-tells-tom-cruise-saved-hollywood-top-gun-maverick-1235522763/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told him</a> at a pre-Oscars lunch after “Top Gun: Maverick” grossed $1.5 billion, Variety reported. The turnout proved people would still go to the movies en masse.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cruise in “Top Gun: Maverick.” The 2022 film was widely credited with revitalizing the film industry after Covid.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paramount Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>As his latest blockbuster, “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” hits theaters Friday, it is clear that Cruise’s persona has stuck. His press tour has featured his own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TK2O7K99kI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paeans</a> to moviemaking and fans’ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ4glT8Jdf2/?igsh=MXdqcnU4NzJoaXkxcw==" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">appreciation</a> for his commitment to doing his own stunts and even how <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/video-tom-cruise-eating-popcorn-164534487.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he eats popcorn</a>.</p><p>Cruise’s career appeared somewhat endangered 20 years ago. He was becoming notorious for his devotion to the Church of Scientology, which defectors have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/us/07scientology.html" title="">accused of institutionalized abuse</a>. He jumped on Oprah Winfrey’s couch. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFgF1JPNR5E" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sparred</a> with Matt Lauer, calling psychiatry “a pseudoscience.”</p><p>But two decades later, Cruise, who declined to comment, remains arguably the world’s biggest movie star, in no small part because he became the most affectionate version of The Onion’s <a href="https://theonion.com/union-lets-tom-cruise-act-during-strike-from-fear-of-wh-1850647899/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parody</a> of him: A guy who really, really digs movies.</p><p>“He loves movies. He just also makes them,” said Joe Quenqua, a media strategist and former Disney executive. “If there was a moment when Tom Cruise was a different version of Tom Cruise, we’re not talking about it now. It’s a blip.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The Cruise persona works because it seems genuine. The appeal of his famous stunts — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj5LqGdQwQ4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scaling</a> the world’s tallest building, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lsFs2615gw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">riding</a> a motorcycle off a cliff, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGQcnZ3esvU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hanging</a> off a biplane thousands of feet in the air (as in the new movie) — is precisely that it is he, Tom Cruise, who is performing them. </p><p>Cruise is relentlessly on message. In London this month, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mo6Zhjw8ikA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">waxed eloquent</a> about the importance for movie actors “to understand what the lens is.” He once made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J0Dan0WaZk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P.S.A.</a> urging consumers to turn off motion-smoothing on their televisions, because motion-smoothing “makes most movies look like they were shot on high-speed video rather than film.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cruise’s self-performed stunts have become a major draw in the “Mission: Impossible” films. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paramount Pictures And Skydance/Paramount Pictures, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“There’s other people who love the deal or this or that,” Doug Liman, the director of Cruise films “Edge of Tomorrow” and “American Made,” said in an interview. “Tom loves movies — he loves going to the movies, making movies, talking about movies. It’s kind of extraordinary.”</p><p>The first 20 years of Cruise’s career saw him taking risky roles with prestigious directors like Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick and Paul Thomas Anderson. It was Cruise who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=bqXZTkJmxgk&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcollider.com%2Fwhy-tom-cruise-hired-brian-de-palma-mission-impossible%2F&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">selected</a> Brian De Palma — your favorite director’s favorite director — to direct the first “Mission: Impossible” film.</p><p>In 2011, the fourth “Mission” movie arrived, its central set-piece a spectacular, self-performed stunt (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj5LqGdQwQ4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scaling</a> Dubai’s Burj Khalifa tower). It set the template for the next four, all of which have been directed by Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie, and for the subsequent phase of Cruise’s career, which has consisted almost entirely of action roles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>When Cruise has a scandal now, it does not undermine his persona, it reinforces it. In 2020, the Sun newspaper <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/1977533/tom-cruise-covid-rant-mission-impossible-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> leaked audio of Cruise berating crew on the set of the seventh “Mission” for violating Covid-era protocols by standing too close together, threatening a set shutdown. “If I see you do it again, you’re gone,” Cruise yelled, with an expletive. Later asked for comment, Cruise <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-05-11/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-covid-19-rant-interview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replied</a>: “I said what I said.”</p><p>Cruise’s movie-loving persona also jibes with the difficult, but not impossible mission of getting his latest movie, with a budget <a href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/3/25/mission-impossible-8-has-a-400m-budget" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> approaching $400 million, into profitability. Two years ago, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning” was boxed out of premium-priced IMAX theaters after a week by Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.” The new “Mission,” Cruise’s ostensibly final turn as Ethan Hunt, received a three-week window after Cruise made a personal case and pledged to use IMAX cameras and premiere in IMAX.</p><p>“We almost never give three weeks,” Rich Gelfond, IMAX’s chief executive, said in an interview.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cruise’s social media co-sign has become an unofficial mark of a blockbuster. Among the films to get Cruise’s stamp of approval are <a href="https://x.com/TomCruise/status/1674062557517168643" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Oppenheimer,” “Barbie,”</a> <a href="https://x.com/TomCruise/status/1810418556779233475" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Twisters”</a> and, weeks ago, “Sinners.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Gelfond texted Cruise to thank him for supporting “Sinners,” which was filmed with IMAX cameras. According to Gelfond, Cruise responded quickly: “He said, ‘When one movie wins, we all win.’”</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Marc Tracy is a Times reporter covering arts and culture.
