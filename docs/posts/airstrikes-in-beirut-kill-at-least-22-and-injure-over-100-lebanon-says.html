    <h1>Airstrikes in Beirut Kill at Least 22 and Injure Over 100, Lebanon Says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The strikes on Thursday destroyed at least one building, videos verified by The New York Times showed, and they followed a weekslong assault by Israel on areas south of Beirut that are known as Hezbollah strongholds.</p><p>Two plumes of thick, acrid smoke rose above the Beirut skyline. Lebanon’s state-run news agency reported that one strike had targeted the middle floor of an eight-story building in the Ras el-Nabaa neighborhood, while the other had leveled a four-story building in the Basta neighborhood.</p><p>Beirut’s Fire Department said that it was battling a blaze at a building in Ras el-Nabaa where residents were being evacuated from the top floor with an electronic ladder. Videos from the Basta neighborhood, verified by The Times, showed adjacent buildings had also been damaged in the strike.</p><p>Less than two weeks ago, an Israeli bombardment of a residential neighborhood near Beirut assassinated Hezbollah’s chief, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Hassan Nasrallah,</a> killed or injured civilians and flattened several buildings.</p><p>Since then, the Israeli military has kept up its bombardments in Lebanon, and the Israeli authorities have suggested that they had also killed Mr. Nasrallah’s likely successor and the person expected to replace the successor.</p></div></div>
