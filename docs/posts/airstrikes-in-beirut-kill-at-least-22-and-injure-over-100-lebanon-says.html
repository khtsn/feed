The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strikes. But it has been systematically targeting Hezbollah leaders and the group’s infrastructure.</p><p>Hezbollah began launching rockets on northern Israel last year in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza after Hamas led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Both militant groups are backed by Iran.</p><p>Israel and Hezbollah have since exchanged a barrage of strikes, displacing tens of thousands of people on either side of the border over the past year. More than 60,000 people in northern Israel have been displaced, and as the conflict has escalated, nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">one million people in Lebanon</a> have fled their homes in recent weeks.

Lebanon’s state-run news agency reported that one strike had targeted the middle floor of an eight-story building in the Ras el-Nabaa neighborhood, while the other had leveled a four-story building in the Basta neighborhood.</p><p>Beirut’s Fire Department said that it was battling a blaze at a building in Ras el-Nabaa where residents were being evacuated from the top floor with an electronic ladder. Videos from the Basta neighborhood, verified by The Times, showed adjacent buildings had also been damaged in the strike.</p><p>Less than two weeks ago, an Israeli bombardment of a residential neighborhood near Beirut assassinated Hezbollah’s chief, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/28/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-dead.html" title="">Hassan Nasrallah,</a> killed or injured civilians and flattened several buildings.</p><p>Since then, the Israeli military has kept up its bombardments in Lebanon, and the Israeli authorities have suggested that they had also killed Mr. Nasrallah’s likely successor and the person expected to replace the successor.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aric Toler is a reporter on the Visual Investigations team at The Times where he uses emerging techniques of discovery to analyze open source information.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aric-toler">More about Aric Toler</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
