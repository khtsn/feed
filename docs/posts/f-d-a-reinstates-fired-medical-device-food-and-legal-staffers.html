    <h1>F.D.A. Reinstates Fired Medical Device, Food and Legal Staffers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many of the reinstated jobs were financed by those kinds of fees, but some such employees were still out of work. Those whose job were funded by an excise tax on cigarettes, for example, said they were not called back to work over the weekend. Those workers reviewed applications for new tobacco products and studied the safety of emerging tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and devices that heat up tobacco but do not burn it.</p><p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/health/fda-trump-layoffs-device-and-food-safety.html" title="">The New York Times featured</a> the accounts of laid-off staff members who reviewed the safety of surgical robots, cardiovascular devices and diabetes-care systems that infuse insulin. All had their jobs back as of Monday morning.</p><p>AdvaMed, a trade association for medical device makers, had pushed the administration in a letter and in meetings to ensure that workers who review those products got their jobs back. The industry’s funds have helped the device review division hire experts, including doctors with experience using the devices. The industry funds are approved periodically in agreements passed by Congress that also include strict deadlines to make approval decisions. </p><p>Reinstated workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation, said about a dozen staffers from the agency’s chief counsel got their jobs back, including lawyers who supported medication policy. About a dozen who oversee cardiovascular devices and another 12 who authorize artificial intelligence software programs were also restored. Others were called back to their jobs assessing food-chemical safety, a priority of the new health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p>In interviews, employees who returned on Monday reported a feeling of whiplash and frustration, but also of relief to get back to work.</p></div></div>
