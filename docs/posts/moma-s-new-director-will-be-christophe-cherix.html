In September, he will take over the leadership position from Glenn Lowry, who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/arts/design/glenn-lowry-moma-director.html" title="">guided the New York museum for almost 30 years</a>.</p><p>His appointment was unveiled in a letter from the museum’s chair, Marie-Josée Kravis, and its president, Sarah Arison. The letter says the board of trustees voted unanimously to appoint Cherix.</p><p>“Christophe’s brilliant curatorial leadership in modern and contemporary art, strong relationships with artists, excellence in scholarship, internationally respected research and publications, and reputation for steady stewardship stood out as indispensable qualities to position the museum to meet the moment,” Kravis and Arison wrote. “He rose to the top of an impressive pool of global candidates.”</p><p>Cherix came to MoMA in 2007 from Switzerland, where he had previously served as curator at an <a href="https://www.mahmah.ch/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">art and history museum</a> in Geneva. He was promoted three years later to chief curator for the department of drawings and prints; he specialized in modern and contemporary art, with a particular focus on the 1960s and ’70s.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zachary Small is a Times reporter writing about the art world’s relationship to money, politics and technology.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zachary-small">More about Zachary Small</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
