His death was ruled an accidental drowning.

Mr. Castic was found in the water days later, his father said. His death was ruled a drowning.</p><p>Ketamine was found in his system, his father said. The New York Police Department said it did not suspect foul play. Still, people on social media around New York City and beyond began to take precautions, warning each other not to go to the venues alone and sharing stories of unnerving occurrences in the area.</p><p>Many questioned why it was business as usual at the Mirage.</p><p>“The question I would love for them to answer is: What does it take for them to feel something is an emergency?” said Jennifer Gutiérrez, a City Council member whose district includes the parts of Brooklyn and Queens where the venues are. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside Knockdown Center, a music venue.
