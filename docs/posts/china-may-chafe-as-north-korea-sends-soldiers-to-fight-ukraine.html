    <h1>China May Chafe as North Korea Sends Soldiers to Fight Ukraine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another concern China’s leadership may have, analysts said, is the exchange of military technology from Russia to North Korea in return for sending troops. That could embolden the North to act more aggressively toward South Korea or Japan, and at the same time, diminish Beijing’s ability to influence the reclusive state even as it relies on China for trade and aid.</p><p>North Korea’s provocative behavior has already contributed to a trilateral security alliance between the United States, Japan and South Korea signed at Camp David last year. The pact, which China has likened to an Asian NATO, has added to Beijing’s feeling that it is being constrained and encircled by the United States and its allies.</p><p>China is now stuck in a middle ground. While the West has tried to isolate Russia, China has deepened trade and diplomatic ties to Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Beijing may not know how to rein in North Korea’s efforts to help the Kremlin, said <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RXwoAAG/victor-cha" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Victor D. Cha</a>, a professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University and the <a href="https://www.csis.org/people/victor-cha" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korea chair</a> at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>“China is caught between paralysis and incompetence on this. While they are supporting Russia’s efforts in the war indirectly, they cannot be happy with the D.P.R.K. piece,” Mr. Cha said, referring to North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “There is nothing good for them in this, short or long term.”</p><p>Questions will linger over whether Beijing knew beforehand about Pyongyang’s plans, much the way speculation persists about whether it had prior knowledge of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p></div></div>
