    <h1>21 Civil Servants Resign From DOGE, Refusing to Implement Elon Musk’s Changes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of 21 civil servants with technology expertise resigned on Tuesday rather than help implement an array of changes to the federal government being pushed by the billionaire Elon Musk and his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-leader.html" title="">Department of Government Efficiency</a>.</p><p>The government employees had worked for the U.S. Digital Service, a technology-focused unit housed in the executive branch, that had been rebranded by Mr. Musk and President Trump as the United States DOGE Service. The resignations pared the unit, which had already been reduced by layoffs, by roughly a third.</p><p>“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” the resigning group wrote <a href="https://www.wethebuilders.org/posts/we-resign-resignation-letter-from-us-digital-service" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a letter</a> addressed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/politics/susie-wiles-trump.html" title="">Susie Wiles</a>, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.”</p><p>The resignations, which were reported earlier by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/doge-elon-musk-federal-government-resignations-usds-6b7e9b7022e6d89d69305e9510f2a43c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>, come as Mr. Musk and his allies have begun to radically reshape the size and scope of the federal government, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/energy-department-layoffs.html" title="">engaging in layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/upshot/doge-musk-trump-errors.html" title="">ending contracts</a> and attempting to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/trump-usaid-employees-firing.html" title="">shutter entire agencies</a>. Most recently, Mr. Musk created confusion for millions of federal employees by issuing a directive ordering them to detail what they had worked on during the previous week as a condition of keeping their jobs. Several Trump appointees ordered employees at their agencies to ignore Mr. Musk’s directive, even as workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/politics/elon-musk-email-federal-workers.html" title="">received contradictory information</a> about whether they need to comply with it.</p></div></div>
