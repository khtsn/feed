		<p>The third week of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2500/vct-2025-pacific-stage-2" target="_blank">VCT Pacific Stage 2</a> came and went fast, with all six of the week&#39;s six matches resulting in 2-0 sweeps. </p>

<p>Stomps, shock upsets, and disappointing collapses highlighted the week&#39;s matches. At the end of the week, six of the region&#39;s eight playoff spots have been claimed, while Group Alpha could be turned on its head with an entertaining week four ahead. While one side of the stage left the match elated, the other stepped down in anguish, as two teams were shut out of the playoffs with one matchday remaining.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how the penultimate week of the group stage played out:</p>



<p>The week started with the biggest blowout, as Gen.G continued its strong Stage 2 form by blowing out Team Secret. After sealing a dominant 13-3 on their classic pick of Lotus, the Tigers closed up shop on Ascent off the back of a 9-3 defense half. That all came despite losing three of four pistol rounds, a foothold that Team Secret could not capitalize on. Gen.G won both eco rounds after losing the two pistol rounds on Lotus. <span data-ref-id="12">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/9196/t3xture">

</span> finished the map 10-1 in first duels, his best performance in that stat so far this stage. The win secured Gen.G&#39;s spot in the playoffs, with a shot at Group Alpha&#39;s top seed well within reach. </p>


<p><em>An unreal round from <span data-ref-id="13">

</span>, who could do no wrong on Lotus.</em></p>

<p>In the second map of the opening day, TALON made quick work of T1 by winning 2-0. The squad&#39;s new all-Thai iteration has seemed unstoppable as of late, as rookies <span data-ref-id="14">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/42901/thyy">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="15">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/13784/killua">
		Killua	</a>
</span> finished hand in hand on top of the kills leaderboard. While TALON&#39;s 13-11 win on Corrode was an impressive finish following a back-and-forth, the 13-6 victory on Lotus was especially impressive. Once a crown jewel of T1&#39;s map pool, the Lotus loss highlighted T1&#39;s recent struggles to adjust as <span data-ref-id="16">

</span> settles into the main Duelist role. TALON secured its playoff spot with the win, while T1 also had its playoff slot secured.</p>

<p>In yet another quick finish, DetonatioN FocusMe defeated BOOM Esports 2-0, shutting BOOM Esports. After stealing BOOM&#39;s Lotus 13-10, DFM dominated its pick of Corrode, winning 13-2. With the win, DFM moved to 3-1, and secured a spot in the playoffs for the first time in the organization&#39;s history. BOOM has collapsed since its dominant 5-0 showing in the <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2379/vct-2025-pacific-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">Stage 1</a> group stage, losing six straight matches in 2-0 fashion since then. BOOM, now eliminated from playoff contention, will have to wait until the end of the season to learn of its fate as a VCT team.</p>

<p>In a match with strong implications for Group Alpha&#39;s top seed, DRX downed Rex Regum Qeon 2-0 in a match that started close and ended anything but. Bind, now fully re-inserted into teams&#39; map pools, has proven to be as back-and-forth as it&#39;s always been. After trading 6-6 halves, DRX came out on top 14-12 in overtime with no shortage of thanks to <span data-ref-id="18">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/35013/flashback">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="19">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4462/mako">

</span> for securing a 2v5. On DRX&#39;s pick of Ascent, seven rounds won on attack gave the Korean squad a cushion to lose the pitol in the second half, closing the map on a six-round win streak. DRX secured its spot in the playoffs, while RRQ will need to fight another week to secure its spot.</p>

<p><em>A 2v5 to end the map in overtime.</em></p>

<p>Nongshim RedForce picked up a crucial 2-0 win over Global Esports as it looks to book a spot in the playoffs. An untimely change on Global&#39;s pick of Corrode saw the squad deviate from its relatively successful double-Duelist comp that also featured a Sage. A 9-3 attack half and second-half pistol round win helped Nongshim cruise to a 13-7 win on the map. Nongshim impressed on Bind, ending its attacker side up 8-4 with a double-Sentinel comp to set up a 13-8 win. Both teams will fight for their playoff chances next week, with Nongshim&#39;s stakes as high as ever as an Ascension squad.</p>

<p>In the biggest upset of the week, ZETA DIVISION secured its first win of the stage with a 2-0 victory over Paper Rex. The loss snapped Paper Rex&#39;s eight-match VCT win streak that dated back to <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2282/valorant-masters-toronto-2025/swiss-stage" target="_blank">Masters Toronto</a>. Perhaps the most impressive detail of the win was that it came on two of PRX&#39;s stronger maps. ZETA picked Lotus, which it won 13-9, and PRX picked Sunset, which ZETA won 13-7. ZETA won all four pistol rounds, and all in all seemed to be sharper on the day, out-aiming and out-dueling a PRX team known for its aim. ZETA, while shut out of the playoffs, went out with a bang.</p>
