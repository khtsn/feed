Then, in 1999, the rules changed; ever since, most winners have sung in English. Our data shows that 18 of the past 24 winners sang entirely in the language of Shakespeare, with two others using English alongside their national tongue.</p><p>Take Ruslana, who won for Ukraine in 2004 with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10XR67NQcAc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wild Dances</a>.” She sang in English for the first two verses of her high energy track (“I want you to want me as I dance / Round and round and round”). Then, once her dance-positive message was clear — helped by some frantic moves — she switched to Ukrainian.</p><p>Obviously it’s impossible to know how important language choice really is. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXwgZL4zx9o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fairytale</a>,” a violin-led stomper that triumphed in 2009, might still have won if Alexander Rybak had sung the catchy melody in the language of his country, Norway. But it’s doubtful as many people would have sung along at home.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><hr/><p>NO. 3</p><h2 id="link-79935550">Allude to folk music.</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-8"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/EUROVISION-98301-cover/EUROVISION-98301-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Zdob si Zdub &amp; Advahov Brothers (Moldova) performing “Trenuletul” in 2022.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It’s a Eurovision cliché to blend a country’s traditional music with an exhilarating pop chorus: There has to be an accordion player somewhere — anywhere! — onstage, like in “Trenuletul,” Moldova’s entry in 2022.</p><p>Indeed, this can pay dividends: Seven winners since 2000 have used folk instruments or traditional melodies. Sertab Erener, for instance, won the 2003 contest for Turkey with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0_QrKnqd5E" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everyway That I Can</a>,” a song that included Middle Eastern rhythms and belly dancers onstage.</p><p>Two years later, Helena Paparizou, representing Greece, won with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghQZojJWxKI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">My Number One</a>,” a Britney Spears-esque pop number that included solos played on the Cretan lyra, a three-stringed Greek instrument similar to a violin.</p><p>More recently, Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra won in 2022 with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8Z51no1TD0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stefania</a>,” a track that included a catchy melody played on the telenka, a Ukrainian flute.</p><p>A warning: Don’t take things too far and submit an actual folk song. Eurovision is a pop contest, and while it’s nice to have some folk flavor, no pure folk act has won this century.</p><hr/><p>NO. 4</p><h2 id="link-6bdbab5e">Forget dramatic key changes</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-10"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/eurovision-serbia-trimmed-sub-68757-cover/eurovision-serbia-trimmed-sub-68757-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Marija Serifovic (Serbia) performing her 2007 winning song “Molitva.” (Wait for it ...)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>A key change near the end was once essential for a Eurovision winner. Just listen to the Olsen Brothers’ “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF8fkHK0AWs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fly on the Wings of Love</a>,” which won for Denmark in 2000. About two-thirds of the way through, the siblings paused dramatically, reached skyward, then belted out the chorus a tone higher.</p><p>Nowadays, though, a key change is best avoided.</p><p>Since Marija Serifovic won for Serbia in 2007 with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSueQN1QvV4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Molitva</a>,” a lovesick ballad that featured not one, but two, key changes, those dramatic tone shifts have not featured in a single winning entry. Their disappearance is so pronounced that, in 2023, Eurovision’s organizers <a href="https://eurovision.tv/story/big-key-change-change" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a blog post</a> lamenting the demise of the “beloved pop gimmick.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><hr/><p>NO. 5</p><h2 id="link-1aa9d8fb">Go all-out on the staging</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-15"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/EUROVISION-30272-cover/EUROVISION-30272-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Nemo (Switzerland) performing their 2024 winning song “The Code.”</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>A great song won’t win Eurovision on its own. You also need a performance or outfit that makes viewers sit up and ask, “What the hell was that?”</p><p>Take Nemo, who won for Switzerland last year by performing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSueQN1QvV4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Code</a>” while perilously balanced on a giant spinning disc. Or Dima Bilan, Russia’s winner in 2008, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-72s4WzUcKI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">setup included</a> a mini-ice rink, on which Bilan sang while an ice dancer twirled around him.</p><p>Eurovision has rules that prevent performers doing anything too crazy. (There can be no live animals onstage, for instance.) And a memorable performances does not have to be high-tech. In 2012, Loreen, representing Sweden, just used a few wind machines to dramatic effect in her winning dance hit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfo-8z86x80" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Euphoria</a>.”</p><p>Acts have to be careful, though, that their onstage gimmicks aren’t too silly. In 2014, Donatan &amp; Cleo of Poland sang “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ920cN2HmA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">My Slowianie</a>,” a celebration of their Slavic heritage, while a woman dressed in a folk costume <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ920cN2HmA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seductively churned butter</a>.

Eight recent winners have made ample use of flames or pyrotechnics.</p><p>Take Emmelie de Forest’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3f9v8ebuD4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Only Teardrops</a>,” which triumphed for Denmark in 2013. Given the title, de Forest should perhaps have ended her performance with water cascading from the ceiling. Fire rained down instead.</p><p>The flames don’t even need to be real. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10XR67NQcAc" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ruslana</a>, who won for Ukraine in 2004, performed in front of screens showing a digital inferno. Perhaps the production budget did not stretch to real ones.</p><p>One thing you must never do, though, is burn a piano. In 2015, halfway through a performance of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f993p0CAV8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I am Yours</a>” by the Austrian indie band the Makemakes, the singer Dominic Muhrer splayed his fingers like a wizard and the strings of his instrument burst into flames.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>The Makemakes came joint last with zero points.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><hr/><p>NO. 7</p><h2 id="link-3d82aeb5">Don’t send a novelty act</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-24"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h4>Lordi (Finland) performing their 2006 winning song “Hard Rock Hallelujah.”</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>Hard rock Hallelujah Hard rock Hallelujah</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/eurovision-trimmed-33141-cover/eurovision-trimmed-33141-cover-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Lordi (Finland) performing their 2006 winning song “Hard Rock Hallelujah.”</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Bands and singers with a jokey central conceit often appear at Eurovision, but only one novelty act has won since 2000: Lordi, a heavy metal band from Finland that won in 2006 with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh9NRGNhUU" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hard Rock Hallelujah</a>.” Its members wore monster outfits and, at one point, the lead singer, Mr. Lordi, unfurled bat wings and waved a huge ax at the crowd.</p><p>Although novelty acts struggle to win, they can easily become part of Eurovision folklore. Who could forget Subwoolfer, Norway’s entry in 2022 with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJjo8s3fKUM" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Give That Wolf a Banana</a>”?
