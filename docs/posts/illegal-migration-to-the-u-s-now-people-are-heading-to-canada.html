(That still pales in comparison to crossings from Mexico: Last year, more than two million people were apprehended at the U.S. southern border, U.S. government data shows.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Canada has directed 1.3 billion Canadian dollars ($900 million) to enhance border security, adding two Black Hawk helicopters and 60 drones equipped with thermal cameras.</p><p>It also tightened requirements for temporary visas that some visitors used to arrive in Canada legally but then enter the United States illegally.</p><p>The Canadian government says its recent measures have drastically driven down the number of unauthorized crossing into the United States: About 5,000 migrants were intercepted at the border in January, a third of the figure in January 2024, according to U.S. data.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Black Hawk helicopter used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police flying over the Canada-U.S. border.

But he also wanted to talk to U.S. officials about the recent uptick of people arriving in Canada from the United States. </p><h2 id="link-10a56ee5">The Opposite Direction</h2><p>Canada’s focus on the border, against the backdrop of Mr. Trump’s domestic crackdown on migrants, is why the nine people walking into Alberta on Feb. 3 raised alarms: It was unusual to see a group this large crossing on foot in the heart of winter. The presence of young children made it all the more troubling.</p><p>The Canadian authorities say they have been intercepting more people arriving from the United States, but because of the schedule Canada follows in releasing data, no numbers are yet available for the weeks since Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January. But government news releases suggest the numbers are rising.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An emergency kit that Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers keep in their cruisers in case they find migrants in distress along the border.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>In Alberta, preliminary calculations show that up to 20 people have been apprehended crossing illegally so far this year, including children as young as 2. </p><p>By contrast, only seven people were apprehended crossing the border illegally in Alberta in all of 2024. </p><p>Of the nine migrants found in Alberta on Feb. 3, seven, including three children ages 13, 10 and 7, were Venezuelans, the R.C.M.P. told The New York Times. The two others were children, 7 and 5 years old, from Colombia.</p><p>Staff Sergeant Harrison, who has worked at the border for two years, said,“It’s the first time I’ve seen Venezuelans here.”</p><p>Venezuelans fleeing the oppressive government of President Nicolás Maduro have been offered protection across the world. Nearly eight million have fled in the past decade, according to the United Nations, an extraordinary number for a nation not at war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Under the Biden administration, 600,000 Venezuelans already living in the United States were granted temporary protection and allowed to live and work in the country.

Their status is unknown.</p><p>Canada and the United States regularly return asylum seekers crossing into each other’s territory, on the premise that both countries are equally safe for asylum seekers to lodge their claims, and that they should do so in the first of the two countries in which they arrive. The policy is formally known as the Safe Third Country Agreement.</p><p>But the Trump administration’s deportation drive and changes to asylum policies call into question whether the United States is still a safe country for asylum seekers, experts and advocates say, and if Canada should continue sending people back over the border.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fox News playing in a cafe overlooking the border in Coutts.
