But she asked that they stay focused on serving New York City, according to two staff members who were on the call.</p><p>A few hours later, Mr. Adams addressed the F.B.I.’s seizures for the first time, resorting to what has become his go-to response in the face of mounting problems: He would “stay focused, no distraction and grind,” he said in a television interview on Fox 5.</p><p>But the remarkable avalanche of investigations and raids that struck at the heart of the mayor’s circle is no ordinary distraction, and it raised immediate questions about the mayor’s ability to manage the nation’s largest city amid an investigative onslaught now affecting much of his senior leadership.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Wednesday, federal agents seized the phones of the city’s police commissioner, first deputy mayor, schools chancellor, deputy mayor for public safety and a senior adviser, and searched at least one of their homes.</p><p>The nature of the investigations, by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, is unclear, but it appears that one is focused on the senior City Hall officials and the other involves the police commissioner. The investigations are distinct from the same office&#39;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/nyregion/eric-adams-fbi-investigation.html" title="">ongoing inquiry into the mayor and his campaign finances</a>.</p><p>Separately, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York is pursuing an investigation that in February prompted federal agents to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/nyregion/fbi-adams-greco-investigation-nyc.html" title="">search two houses owned by the mayor’s director of Asian affairs</a>.</p><p>Mr. Adams has not been accused of any crimes, and he has repeatedly said that as a retired police captain, he has a particular fealty to the law. But the investigations have cast a pall over City Hall and prompted a feeding frenzy for his critics.</p><p>They come at a time of already acute vulnerability for the mayor, once considered a rising Democratic star whose stature has precipitously fallen. At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/nyregion/eric-adams-dnc-convention.html" title="">the mayor was barely a presence</a>, without even a modest speaking role.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>A Quinnipiac University poll in December put his approval rating at 28 percent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/nyregion/nyc-eric-adams-poll.html" title="">the lowest for a New York City mayor</a> since Quinnipiac began surveying the city in 1996. The Democratic primary for mayor next June is expected to be an unusually contested one, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/nyregion/brad-lander-mayor-adams.html" title="">several</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/nyregion/zellnor-myrie-nyc-mayor-election.html" title="">serious</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/nyregion/scott-stringer-nyc-mayor-race.html" title="">candidates</a> already in the race, and others thinking of jumping in.</p><p>The investigations are sure to be a focus of the primary campaign, with some of Mr. Adams’s rivals getting an early start with their criticism, including <a href="https://x.com/bradlander/status/1831757972860760115" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brad Lander</a>, the city comptroller, and <a href="https://x.com/scottmstringer/status/1831742021435806144" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott Stringer</a>, the former comptroller, both of whom are running for mayor.</p><p>Mr. Lander said that with an “unending stream of stories about the Adams administration being raided and investigated by federal law enforcement, it is clear that New Yorkers are not getting the steady leadership we deserve.”</p><p>Zohran Mamdani, a state lawmaker from Queens who is considering entering the race, <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1831766087559737639" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said the city was facing a cost of living crisis</a> and deserved better: “An administration plagued by corruption and distracted by scandal cannot effectively deal with it.”</p><p>Mr. Adams, the city’s second Black mayor, and his allies contend that he is being held to a different standard because of his background.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a longtime ally of the mayor who leads the Brooklyn Democratic Party, said residents in her East Flatbush community had pointed out that many of the people being investigated were Black. She said that a constituent recently asked her: “Why is the federal government harassing these Black folks?”</p><p>The mayor has gone so far as to accuse unnamed forces of conspiring to deny him a second term — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/nyregion/mayor-adams-dinkins.html" title="">frequently comparing himself</a> to the city’s first Black mayor, David N. Dinkins, who lost his re-election bid to Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p><p>But Mr. Dinkins never faced the simultaneous federal inquiries that have descended on Mr. Adams and his circle.</p><p>Signs that the investigations have distracted the mayor and his team are not hard to find. In November, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/nyregion/eric-adams-brianna-suggs-fbi-raid.html" title="">when Mr. Adams learned that his chief fund-raiser’s home had been raided</a>, he immediately canceled a series of meetings in Washington, D.C., with federal officials about migrants — an issue he had cast as existential to New York City — and rushed home to comfort his staff, he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Following Thursday’s news, the police commissioner, Edward A. Caban, failed to appear at a planned event with the American Cancer Society. The schools chancellor, David C. Banks, who should have been celebrating the first day of school, <a href="https://x.com/DanMannarino/status/1831818492032774621" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">canceled a television interview</a> with WPIX-TV.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Edward A. Caban, New York City’s police commissioner, is among the top officials whose phones were seized by federal agents.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">David Dee Delgado for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The turmoil comes amid substantive and vexing challenges for the city: an affordability crisis that is pushing families out of the city, an influx of migrants from the southern border that is straining the city’s shelter system, persistent fears over crime, concerns about the commercial real estate market, traffic congestion and cleanliness.</p><p>Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a statement on Friday that throughout the F.B.I.’s raids and investigations, Mr. Adams had remained focused on “delivering for the people of the city and the results speak for themselves.” Mr. Levy cited lower crime rates and higher employment numbers, among other priorities.</p><p>Maya Wiley, who ran for mayor against Mr. Adams in 2021 and who served as counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio when he was facing his own federal inquiry, said the investigations would undoubtedly affect the work of high-ranking officials, but that day-to-day operations like garbage collection would go on.</p><p>“It’s incredibly stressful and distracting for people at the top levels of government that need to make big decisions and move policy,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>In addition to the five top officials, several others were also caught up in the investigations. Federal agents searched the home and seized the phone of a consultant who is the brother of both the schools chancellor and one of the deputy mayors, and seized the phones of the police commissioner’s chief of staff and two Queens precinct commanders.</p><p>Five city officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said they were stunned by the revelations, and two of them said they were worried about how the expanding investigations might affect their work.</p><p>Even so, some wheels of government have kept turning as planned.</p><p>Mr. Adams sought to keep a routine schedule on Wednesday, even after the F.B.I. conducted its raids, which had not yet been made public.</p><p>When a city subcontractor mistakenly drilled a hole through the casing of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, causing river water to pour in and prompting the tunnel’s closure, Mr. Adams visited the site and spoke to the news media. On Thursday, he appeared at Public School 257 in Brooklyn with Mr. Banks, the schools chancellor, smiling and giving students high fives on their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/nyc-first-day-school-photos.html" title="">first day of school</a>.</p><p>Shortly after the news broke on Thursday, Mr. Adams was scheduled to attend a 2 p.m. roundtable discussion at City Hall about electric bike safety. Robert Holden, a City Council member from Queens, said he had been trying to get the meeting for six months, and after he saw the news about the raids, he worried that the mayor would cancel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>But Mr. Adams came and listened to victims who had been injured in crashes and members of Transportation Alternatives, a street safety group. Mr. Adams was joined by Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a top adviser, and Jenifer Rajkumar, a state lawmaker from Queens and near-constant fixture at Mr. Adams’s side.</p><p>“He was patient — he listened,” Mr. Holden said. “He didn’t say much. He wanted to hear both sides.”</p><p>But try as he might to focus, Mr. Adams is unlikely to escape the issue, and his critics are unlikely to let it drop. Jumaane Williams, the public advocate, said that the investigations “affect New Yorkers’ confidence in government” and called on the mayor to “provide clear and immediate explanations to the public to help restore trust.”</p><p>On Friday, the mayor kept a limited schedule, including a meeting with the mayor of Lisbon and the U.S. ambassador to Portugal, and a prerecorded television interview that will air in the evening.</p><p>Jeffery C.
