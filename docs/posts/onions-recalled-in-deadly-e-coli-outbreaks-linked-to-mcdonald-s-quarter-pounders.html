Yum Brands would not elaborate or say how many sites in how many states would not offer onions.</p><p>Though federal regulators have not confirmed the source of the outbreak, which has so far killed one person and sickened 49, initial investigations have suggested that the fresh slivered onions served mainly atop the Quarter Pounder were a “likely source of contamination.”</p><p>Taylor Farms, the sole supplier of those onions to the affected McDonald’s locations in 10 states, issued a recall Wednesday of several yellow onion products because of “potential E. coli contamination,” according to a notice from U.S. Foods, which distributes the products to many restaurants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Yum Brands declined to say whether Taylor Farms supplied their onions.</p><p>The notice instructed restaurants to immediately stop serving the specified onions — diced, peeled and whole — and destroy them.</p><p>The items were voluntarily recalled by Taylor Farms Colorado out of an “abundance of caution,” a spokeswoman for U.S. Foods said in an email. Taylor Farms did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>McDonald’s and the Food and Drug Administration said preliminary reviews linked the outbreak to those slivered onions, but health officials and McDonald’s said they had not ruled out possible contamination of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/ecoli-mcdonalds-hamburgers-quarter-pounders-us-outbreak.html#:~:text=After%20an%20E.%20coli%20outbreak,customers%20will%20prevail%2C%20experts%20say.&amp;text=It&#39;s%20bigger%20than%20a%20regular,eat%20than%20a%20Big%20Mac." title="">quarter-pound beef patties</a> used for the popular menu item. The Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also investigating the source of the contamination.</p><p>The outbreak has sickened people across the Mountain West, though most cases have been clustered in Colorado.</p><p>Sysco, one of the largest food distributors in the United States, has also notified its customers of the onion recall, a spokesman for the company said. McDonald’s is not a Sysco customer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>McDonald’s has stopped using slivered onions, and has halted sales of Quarter Pounders at restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma. McDonald’s has said that its other hamburger items are not affected by the recall.</p><p>One lawsuit has already been <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ron-simon-and-associates-files-the-first-e-coli-lawsuit-against-mcdonalds-302284870.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed on behalf of at least 10 people</a> who say they were sickened by McDonald’s food, including one Colorado man who said he went to the emergency room after eating at his local McDonald’s.</p><p>E. coli outbreaks are not uncommon in the United States, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University.</p><p>Every year, there are between 20 to 50 E. coli outbreaks, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C. said. In 2024 alone, 13 cases have been linked to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/organic-walnuts-04-24.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/walnuts-04-24/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organic walnuts</a> and 11 cases were linked to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/raw-milk-cheese-2-24.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raw Cheddar cheese</a>.</p><p>In 2019, a large <a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/ecoli/2019/o157h7-11-19/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">E. coli outbreak</a> linked to romaine lettuce grown in California’s Salinas Valley sickened 167 people in 27 states, including 85 who were hospitalized. Although Taylor Farms did not issue a recall during the outbreak, in 2019 it said research suggested that irrigation water had been the source of the contamination.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Experts have found that open creeks used to water fields can be littered with feces from wild animals and larger-scale cattle and other farms. At the time, <a href="https://www.taylorfarms.com/newsroom/letter-to-industry/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taylor Farms company pledged</a> to only buy leafy greens from growers that treated their irrigation water to kill bacteria.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-pre-harvest-agricultural-water" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finalized a rule last year</a> on how water should be treated on farms that grow produce, but did not require routine treatment of irrigation water. Instead, the rule calls on farmers to assess the risks unique to their farm and take steps to minimize them.</p><p>What worries experts about this outbreak is that this particular strain of the bacteria can cause a life-threatening condition called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome which damages blood vessels in the kidneys.</p><p>The condition is most common in young children and there is no treatment to stop the disease from progressing once it has started. Federal health officials said one of the people hospitalized with the disease was a child. Of the 49 people with a confirmed case of E. coli, the youngest was 13.</p><p>“If you had to pick the characteristics you would not want to have in your food-borne disease group, this is a good set,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>One silver lining of this outbreak, Dr. Kowalcyk said, is that parents don’t generally buy the large hamburgers for young children.</p><p>Dr. Osterholm said that while beef used to be the frequent source of E. coli outbreaks (dangerous strains of the bacteria often lives in cow intestines), several high-profile outbreaks have sparked food safety changes that has made beef a less likely culprit.</p><p>For example, after a 1993 E. coli outbreak related to undercooked Jack in the Box hamburger patties — which sickened hundreds, killed four children and left others with kidney failure — the F.D.A. <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/41634/18038_aer831d.pdf?v=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised the recommended internal temperature</a> for hamburgers.</p><p>Christina Jewett contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Food Safety Issues and How to Avoid Them</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Listeria:</strong> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/well/listeria-survivors-boars-head.html">listeria outbreak</a> has been linked to Boar’s Head deli meats, leading to a recall of seven million pounds of the company’s products. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/health/boars-head-recall-deli-meats-listeria.html">Here’s what to know.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Elevated Lead Levels: </strong>One dozen of 36 cinnamon products tested by a consumer group contained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/health/lead-cinnamon.html">elevated levels of lead</a>, according to a study that reinforced concerns about metals in foods after tainted cinnamon applesauce poisoned dozens of children last year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refreezing Food: </strong>Shuttling dishes and ingredients from fridge to freezer and back again can be totally fine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/freezer-food-safety.html">as long as you follow these guidelines</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.
