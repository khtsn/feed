A spokeswoman for Yum Brands, which owns several fast-food chains, said that its restaurants were yanking onions from their menus “out of an abundance of caution.” Yum Brands would not elaborate or say how many sites in how many states would not offer onions.</p><p>Federal regulators have not confirmed the source of the outbreak, which has so far killed one person and sickened 49. Initial investigations have suggested that the fresh, slivered onions served mainly atop the Quarter Pounder were a “likely source of contamination.”</p><p>Taylor Farms, the sole supplier of those onions to the affected McDonald’s locations in 10 states, issued a recall of several yellow onion products because of “potential E. coli contamination,” according to a notice from U.S. Foods, a company that distributes the Taylor ingredients to many restaurants.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Burger King said that about five percent of its sites nationwide are supplied with onions from the Taylor Farms Colorado facility, and said it would stop offering them in the region for now. A spokeswoman for the fast food chain said the company was not aware of any illnesses connected to its food.</p><p>Yum Brands declined to say whether Taylor Farms supplied its onions. In addition, although U.S. Foods alerted its customers, a spokeswoman said it did not directly supply McDonald’s with Taylor onions. McDonald’s declined to publicly identify its distributors.</p><p>The U.S. Foods notice instructed restaurants to immediately stop serving the specified onions — diced, peeled and whole — and destroy them.</p><p>The items were voluntarily recalled by Taylor Farms Colorado out of an “abundance of caution,” a spokeswoman for U.S. Foods said in an email. Taylor Farms did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>McDonald’s and the Food and Drug Administration said preliminary reviews linked the outbreak to those raw, slivered onions. But health officials and McDonald’s said that they had not ruled out possible contamination of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/us/ecoli-mcdonalds-hamburgers-quarter-pounders-us-outbreak.html#:~:text=After%20an%20E.%20coli%20outbreak,customers%20will%20prevail%2C%20experts%20say.&amp;text=It&#39;s%20bigger%20than%20a%20regular,eat%20than%20a%20Big%20Mac." title="">quarter-pound beef patties</a> used for the burger, a popular menu item. The Agriculture Department said a state agency has collected ground beef patties for testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also investigating reports from people who became ill in a number of states.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The outbreak has sickened people across the Mountain West, though most cases have been clustered in Colorado.</p><p>Sysco, one of the largest food distributors in the United States, has also notified its customers of the onion recall, a spokesman for the company said. McDonald’s is not a Sysco customer.</p><p>McDonald’s has stopped using slivered onions, and has halted sales of Quarter Pounders at restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma. McDonald’s has said that its other hamburger items are not affected by the recall.</p><p>One lawsuit has already been <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ron-simon-and-associates-files-the-first-e-coli-lawsuit-against-mcdonalds-302284870.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed on behalf of at least 10 people</a> who say they were sickened by McDonald’s food, including one Colorado man who said he went to the emergency room after eating at his local McDonald’s.</p><p>E. coli outbreaks are not uncommon in the United States, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Every year, there are 20 to 50 E. coli outbreaks, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C. said. In 2024 alone, 13 cases have been linked to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/organic-walnuts-04-24.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/walnuts-04-24/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organic walnuts</a> and 11 cases were linked to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/raw-milk-cheese-2-24.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raw Cheddar cheese</a>.</p><p>In 2019, a large <a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/ecoli/2019/o157h7-11-19/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">E. coli outbreak</a> linked to romaine lettuce grown in the Salinas Valley region of California sickened 167 people in 27 states, including 85 who were hospitalized. Taylor Farms did not issue a recall during the outbreak, but acknowledged in 2019 that research suggested that irrigation water was the source of the contamination.</p><p>Experts have found that open creeks used to water fields can be littered with feces from wild animals and larger-scale cattle ranches and other farms. At the time, <a href="https://www.taylorfarms.com/newsroom/letter-to-industry/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taylor Farms company pledged</a> to buy leafy greens only from growers that killed bacteria by treating their irrigation water.</p><p>The F.D.A. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-pre-harvest-agricultural-water" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finalized a rule last year</a> on how water should be managed on farms that grow produce, but did not require routine treatment of irrigation water. Instead, the rule calls on farmers to assess the risks unique to their farm and take steps to minimize them.</p><p>What worries experts about this outbreak is that this particular strain of the bacteria can cause a life-threatening condition called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, which damages blood vessels in the kidneys.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The condition is most common in young children and there is no treatment to stop the disease from progressing once it has started. Federal health officials said one of the people hospitalized with the disease was a child. Of the 49 people with a confirmed case of E. coli, the youngest was 13.</p><p>“If you had to pick the characteristics you would not want to have in your food-borne disease group, this is a good set,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>One silver lining of this outbreak, Dr. Kowalcyk said, is that parents don’t generally buy the large hamburgers for young children.</p><p>Dr. Osterholm said that while beef used to be a frequent source of E. coli outbreaks (dangerous strains of the bacteria often live in cow intestines), several high-profile outbreaks have led to food safety changes that have made beef less likely to be a culprit.</p><p>For example, after an E. coli outbreak in 1993 related to undercooked Jack in the Box hamburger patties — which sickened hundreds, killed four children and left others with kidney failure — the F.D.A. <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/41634/18038_aer831d.pdf?v=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised the recommended internal temperature</a> for hamburgers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Historically, a large proportion of food-borne illnesses has proved impossible to trace back to the source. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ifsac/media/pdfs/P19-2021-report-TriAgency-508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A study by federal officials</a> looking at more than 3,800 clusters of E. coli, salmonella and listeria illnesses found that about 40 percent of the cases could not be linked to a particular food.</p><p>The study examined outbreaks from 1998 through 2021 before whole genome sequencing became commonplace in food-safety investigations.</p><p>Sequencing provided a breakthrough to inspectors investigating a recent cluster of 10 listeria-related deaths and dozens of illnesses linked to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/listeria-outbreak-boars-head-deli-meat.html" title="">Boar’s Head deli meats</a>. Public health inspectors in Maryland and New York found the strain of listeria in packaged liverwurst that matched bacteria from hospitalized patients.</p><p>The F.D.A., which oversees fresh produce, has said that it is looking at all sources of possible E. coli contamination as the Quarter Pounder investigation rapidly develops.</p><p>Taylor Farms has also faced federal scrutiny in recent years over violations of the Clean Air Act related to its handling of the anhydrous ammonia it uses for refrigeration in some of its food processing facilities. The gas was released at a Rhode Island facility after a forklift hit a storage container. The Environmental Protection Agency fined the company $650,000 in 2023 over the violation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The company paid a $67,000 fine from the E.P.A. in 2018 over releasing pollutants into a local waterway near its plant in Salinas, Calif.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Christina Jewett covers the Food and Drug Administration, which means keeping a close eye on drugs, medical devices, food safety and tobacco policy.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/christina-jewett">More about Christina Jewett</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Food Safety Issues and How to Avoid Them</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Listeria:</strong> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/well/listeria-survivors-boars-head.html">listeria outbreak</a> has been linked to Boar’s Head deli meats, leading to a recall of seven million pounds of the company’s products. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/health/boars-head-recall-deli-meats-listeria.html">Here’s what to know.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Elevated Lead Levels: </strong>One dozen of 36 cinnamon products tested by a consumer group contained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/health/lead-cinnamon.html">elevated levels of lead</a>, according to a study that reinforced concerns about metals in foods after tainted cinnamon applesauce poisoned dozens of children last year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refreezing Food: </strong>Shuttling dishes and ingredients from fridge to freezer and back again can be totally fine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/freezer-food-safety.html">as long as you follow these guidelines</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.
