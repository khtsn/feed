An Israeli military official confirmed the presence near that peacekeeping base, and said that Hezbollah was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/07/world/israel-iran-hezbollah-lebanon/israeli-troops-have-set-up-near-un-peacekeepers-in-lebanon-satellite-images-show?smid=url-share" title="">launching rockets</a> from next to the base with impunity.</p><p>The two soldiers injured on Thursday — who the peacekeeping force said were hospitalized but whose wounds were “not serious” — were from Indonesia, according to a U.N. official briefed on the attacks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The peacekeepers inside the bunker in the second episode — at a base in the town of Labbouneh, about two miles from Naqoura — were Italian, said the official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. UNIFIL said vehicles and communications equipment were damaged.</p><p>It also said that a day earlier Israeli soldiers had “fired at and disabled” the security cameras around the perimeter of the U.N. facility in Labbouneh.</p><p>UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, has been tasked since 1978 with maintaining peace along a volatile 75-mile stretch called the Blue Line, the de facto border to which Israel withdrew after ending its occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000.</p><p>The town of Naqoura has been home to UNIFIL headquarters for decades. While other troops have been injured since last October, when Hezbollah and the Israeli military started increasingly trading cross-border fire, the recent cases have been more serious and raised alarm.</p><p>Hezbollah exercises de facto control over much of southern Lebanon, and Israeli officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/12/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war-news?smid=url-share#un-peacekeepers-are-facing-increased-attacks-along-the-israel-lebanon-border" title="">repeatedly criticized UNIFIL</a> for failing to deter Hezbollah’s operations in that part of the country.

He said the agency’s regional chief was among those killed and that the building, near a church in the southern Lebanese town of Derdghaiya, was leveled in the attack.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rescuers searching for survivors at a civil defense base in southern Lebanon early on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bilal Kashmar/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Lebanon’s health ministry condemned the killings, accusing the Israeli military of targeting ambulance crews and rescue teams. There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military.</p><p>At least 65 health workers have been killed in Lebanon since Israel intensified its offensive there against Hezbollah three weeks ago, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday. It added that the agency had recorded 16 “attacks on health care” across the country in the same period of time. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Israel’s military has accused Hezbollah of hiding within the civilian population, in one case saying that the militant group had set up a command center <a href="https://t.me/idfofficial/10814" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">next to a hospital</a>.<span>  </span></p><p>Hezbollah kept up its rocket attacks into Israel on Thursday, setting off sirens in parts of the country’s north. Some were intercepted but several struck the area, according to the military. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.</p><p>Hezbollah said it had been targeting Israeli troops stationed along the border with Lebanon, and in the city of Kiryat Shmona.

It earlier said it had struck 110 sites in the country over the past day and claimed to have killed two Hezbollah commanders. Hezbollah did not comment on the claims.</p><p>With the fighting showing no sign of letting up, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, suggested on Thursday that diplomatic efforts with the United States and France to secure a pause in the fighting had “intensified.”</p><p>Mr. Mikati’s comments, in a statement from his office, could not be independently verified. There was no immediate comment from the United States or France, which last month had put forward a proposal for a 21-day pause in the fighting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Euan Ward is a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/euan-ward">More about Euan Ward</a></span></p></div><div><p>Liam Stack is a Times reporter on special assignment in Israel, covering the war in Gaza.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack">More about Liam Stack</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/world-health-organization">World Health Organization</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Middle East Crisis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Separated by a Few Miles, and the War:</strong><strong> </strong>A Palestinian family has been stuck at opposite ends of the Gaza Strip, with their young children, for most of the yearlong conflict. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/world/middleeast/gaza-family-separation.html">The emotional toll has been devastating</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biden and Netanyahu Speak:</strong><strong> </strong>The conversation, their first in two months, focused on Israel’s plans to retaliate against Iran for a missile attack and carried the weight of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel.html">the worst relationship between the United States and Israel in years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.N.
