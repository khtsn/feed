    <h1>Trump Weighs Key Personnel Choices, Schooled by His First-Term Experience</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President-elect Donald J. Trump is not known for adherence to a disciplined and rigorous personnel selection process, but behind the scenes his advisers and allies have been preparing lists of candidates for the most important jobs in his administration.</p><p>Three days after he decisively won a second term, Mr. Trump held his first formal transition meetings on Friday to turn his attention to the choices he faces.</p><p>He is most keenly interested, aides and advisers say, in a handful of roles: attorney general, C.I.A. director, White House counsel and secretaries of Defense, State and Homeland Security. At one point during the 2024 campaign, he demanded the resignation of the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, whom he had appointed in 2017.</p><p>He has put little focus so far on who will lead other cabinet departments, though he has told aides he wants to let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “do whatever he wants” with the health agencies, and perhaps be secretary of Health and Human Services if he can be confirmed by the Senate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump is relying in part on the work done by Howard Lutnick, the billionaire chief executive of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, who has spent months overseeing a team that has drawn up lists and done vetting for any red flags.</p><p>But Mr. Trump, who is a mix of competing impulses, is also doing what he always does: calling around to friends and associates, asking them who they think he should pick.</p><p>People familiar with his thinking say he wants to install leaders throughout the government who will be willing to purge what he considers “deep state” officials who in his view sabotaged his first term. But despite his criticism of “globalists,” Mr. Trump, they say, tends to favor rich Wall Street types for Treasury secretary. He wants a trade adviser who believes in tariffs. He wants a Homeland Security secretary who will secure the border and act on his desire for mass deportations, and he wants top security aides — like a national security adviser and secretaries of State and Defense — who won’t push back on his “America First” worldview and his desire to shrink the nation’s military footprint abroad.</p><p>Mixed into all of this is Mr. Trump’s obsession with trying to cast the “right look” for each role, as well as his desire for approval and positive news coverage of his choices.</p><p>There is the potential for clashes of personality and ideology as Mr. Trump embarks on his selections, as there are multiple camps around him.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>There are right-wing populists like Vice President-elect JD Vance. There are populists who are further to the left on some policies, like Mr. Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic member of Congress, both of whom are close to Omeed Malik, a financier and Trump ally who has met with transition officials this week. There are the hard-right commentators and online influencers whom Mr. Trump sees as his “fighters.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-appointments-02-kwvp/08dc-trump-appointments-02-kwvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-appointments-02-kwvp/08dc-trump-appointments-02-kwvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/08/multimedia/08dc-trump-appointments-02-kwvp/08dc-trump-appointments-02-kwvp-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Robert F.

There are corporate leaders who have spent the past few months making flattering phone calls to Mr. Trump.</p><p>And in a category all his own is the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who has gained tremendous access to and influence with Mr. Trump and whose businesses are subject to government regulation and work extensively with the Pentagon and other agencies. Mr. Musk this week was around Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s club and residence in Florida, as transition meetings began.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s advisers have been trying to avoid the collision of factions that marked his post-election transition in 2016.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In a brief statement, a transition spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said that Mr. Trump would begin making decisions soon.</p><p>With the caveat that candidates can rise and fall in Mr. Trump’s favor, here are some of the people in contention for the most important jobs:</p><h2 id="link-650dbe57">Attorney General</h2><p>There is no job about which Mr. Trump cares more than attorney general. Mr. Trump has never viewed the Justice Department as an agency that should operate with a substantial degree of independence from direct presidential control, a sharp break from the post-Watergate norms of American politics. He wants an attorney general who will be his legal pit bull — a trusted loyalist who will defend him and follow his instructions.</p><p>In his first term, Mr. Trump was subject to a long-running Justice Department inquiry into his campaign’s ties to Russia.</p><p>For his second term, Mr. Trump has much less to worry about. The Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity for official acts, handed down earlier this year in connection with one of his federal indictments, gives Mr. Trump sweeping protection.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump has never viewed the Justice Department as an agency that should operate with a substantial degree of independence from direct presidential control.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L. Cross for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>But Mr. Trump has also promised to prosecute some opponents. If he intends to follow through on that he will need a pliable attorney general, one willing to stretch or break the tradition of keeping politics out of the justice system to an even greater degree <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/politics/trump-investigations-enemies.html" title="">than Mr. Trump demanded of attorneys general in his first term</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Some of the names being discussed include Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a former Trump critic who has turned into one of his most outspoken loyalists; Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri, who as attorney general of that state went after the big tech companies for what he claimed was collusion with the Biden administration to censor conservatives; John Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman who served as director of national intelligence in Mr. Trump’s first term; and Mark Paoletta, a longtime Republican lawyer and a veteran of Mr. Trump’s first administration.</p><h2 id="link-6eb7c8a4">C.I.A. Director</h2><p>During his first term, Mr. Trump valued the work of his initial C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo. But he believed the career officials in the agency were trying to thwart him, a feeling that intensified after Mr. Pompeo left to become secretary of state and was replaced by Gina Haspel, a longtime C.I.A. officer.</p><p>Mr. Trump finished his term deeply suspicious of Ms. Haspel. At the very end of his first term, Mr. Trump secretly planned to install a die-hard loyalist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/kash-patel.html" title="">Kash Patel</a>, as deputy C.I.A. director, before backing off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump appointed Gina Haspel, middle, as C.I.A. director after Mike Pompeo, left.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Doug Mills/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For his second term, Mr. Trump will want to turn to somebody he trusts and who will be willing to overhaul the C.I.A., people familiar with his thinking said.</p><p>Mr. Ratcliffe, whose name is being mentioned for several different roles, is considered a top contender. Mr. Patel remains personally close to Mr. Trump but is distrusted by many in Mr. Trump’s inner circle and might have difficulty winning Senate confirmation. Representative Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida and a decorated military veteran, has become close to Mr. Trump’s team and is another possibility for the job.</p><h2 id="link-e68c3a4">Defense Secretary</h2><p>The selection of a defense secretary could bring an ideological battle between the old-guard Republicans who favor a more interventionist foreign policy and supporters of the MAGA movement who are more skeptical of U.S. involvement around the world. It could also highlight concerns over Mr. Trump’s stated desire to use the military for domestic purposes.</p><p>One candidate, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, has withdrawn from consideration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Pentagon in Arlington, Va.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>Another possibility, Mr. Pompeo, is already drawing criticism from many on the right who consider him too eager to use American military force overseas. David Sacks, a major Trump donor and friend of Mr. Musk’s, has been among the many online critics, posting on X several times that Mr. Pompeo supports broad funding for Ukraine and an expansion of NATO — a grave sin on the MAGA right.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Other names in the mix include Mr. Waltz; Robert O’Brien, who served as Mr. Trump’s last national security adviser; and Lee Zeldin, the former congressman from New York.</p><h2 id="link-2871b2cb">Secretary of State</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s choice to be America’s top diplomat will inherit a busy agenda, including dangerous volatility in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, the future of NATO, rising economic tensions and a more assertive China.</p><p>His secretary of state will also be called on to articulate how Mr. Trump defines American power and the country’s place in the world. Rex Tillerson, who filled the role at the start of Mr. Trump’s first administration, reportedly came to view him as “a moron.”</p><p>Potential candidates this time around include Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and Richard Grenell, who served briefly as the acting director of national intelligence in Mr. Trump’s last term and more recently has been involved in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/us/politics/jared-kushner-pursuing-development-deals-in-albania-and-serbia.html" title="">business deals abroad</a> with Jared Kushner, the president-elect’s son-in law.</p><h2 id="link-7edaebfa">Homeland Security Secretary</h2><p>Mr. Trump’s top policy adviser and speechwriter, Stephen Miller, has developed detailed plans for an aggressive immigration agenda that includes, as Mr. Trump has called it, “the largest deportation program in American history.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>That agenda will put the homeland security secretary in the middle of one of the most contentious issues facing the nation.</p><p>To execute a mass deportation program, Mr. Miller told The New York Times last year, the administration would need to mobilize the military and law enforcement to help round up and detain undocumented migrants. Massive camps would need to be built as “staging areas,” to hold the migrants while they await deportation, Mr. Miller said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump sent active-duty soldiers to the border with Mexico in Donna, Texas, in 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Mr. Trump has said he likes the idea of appointing Thomas Homan, his former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to run homeland security, but Mr. Miller is expected to play an outsize role in choosing people for all the key positions that relate to immigration.</p><h2 id="link-42eae21f">Treasury Secretary</h2><p>In his first term, Mr. Trump appointed as his Treasury secretary the former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin. His view of the job appears to have changed little: He wants a rich guy, ideally a Wall Street titan in charge of the money.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>Some of the names under discussion include Mr. Lutnick and Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager whom the former president has praised from the stage at some of his campaign appearances. Mr. Bessent met with Mr. Trump on Friday, according to two people briefed on the matter.</p><h2 id="link-1502eb47">White House Counsel</h2><p>The two men who held the role of White House counsel in Mr. Trump’s first administration, Donald F. McGahn II and Pat A. Cipollone, repeatedly had to reel in some of the president’s demands — and bear the brunt of his fury.</p><p>Among the names that have circulated for the job are Stanley Woodward, who has represented several of Mr. Trump’s aides in the criminal investigations into the incoming president. Another is David Warrington, who was essentially the 2024 campaign’s general counsel.</p><p>Another who has been discussed for that role is Bill McGinley, who was the cabinet secretary in the Trump White House.</p><p>Two other lawyers who have worked on Mr. Trump’s legal cases — Todd Blanche and Emil Bove — are expected to have significant posts in the administration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-26"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>There are few roles that were more important within the first Trump White House than the counsel.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Tierney L.
