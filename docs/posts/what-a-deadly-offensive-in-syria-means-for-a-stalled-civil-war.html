On Thursday, the opposition forces advanced, capturing several new villages, according to a British-based monitoring group, the <a href="https://www.syriahr.com/en/350043/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a>.</p><p>The offensive aims to stop attacks by government forces and their Iran-backed militia allies, a rebel commander said.</p><p>Two days of fierce clashes have killed more than 150 combatants from both sides: nearly 100 from rebel groups which launched the offensive and 54 regime soldiers, according to the Observatory. The group gathers information from a network of activists and others across Syria, and its numbers could not be independently verified.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In addition to those deaths, more than a dozen civilians have been killed by Syrian and Russian airstrikes, according to the White Helmets, a rescue group based in opposition areas. Russia and Iran have for years robustly helped President Bashar al-Assad’s autocratic regime stave off the rebels.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-305da7df">Who are the rebels?</h2><p>The offensive unites various rebel factions that represent the last vestiges of a once-sprawling array of opposition groups. Starting in 2011, they fought hard to oust Mr. al-Assad and, at one point, controlled large parts of the country.</p><p>The main group is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a faction formerly linked to the terrorist group Al Qaeda. It controls most of the northwestern territory still held by opposition groups.</p><p>Several Turkish-backed rebel groups have also joined the offensive, according to commanders of the groups and the Observatory.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Though they share a common enemy, the various rebel factions have often fought among themselves, undermining the cohesion they needed to challenge the Syrian military.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Smoke billows from the site of clashes and exchanges of shelling between Syrian opposition factions and regime forces in Aleppo province on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-2dfd4929">What are the aims of the offensive?</h2><p>In a video statement announcing the offensive, Lt. Col. Hassan Abdulghany, military commander of the opposition’s operation’s room, said the attack was aimed at stemming Syrian airstrikes and other attacks on opposition-held territory.</p><p>“To push back their fire from our people, this operation is not a choice. It is an obligation to defend our people and their land,” he said. “It has become clear to everyone that the regime militias and their allies, including the Iranian mercenaries, have declared an open war on the Syrian people.”</p><p>Iran has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/middleeast/iran-syria-israel.html" title="">backed</a> the Syrian government throughout the war, sending advisers and commanders of its powerful Revolutionary Guards force to bases and front lines and backing militias, with thousands of fighters, to defend the government.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h2 id="link-481e0513">What does the Syrian government say?</h2><p>Syrian state media reported on Thursday that government forces were confronting a “large-scale terrorist attack” on villages, towns and military sites.</p><p>Since the early days of the uprising, the government has characterized all opposition as “terrorists.”</p><p>The government said it was responding “in cooperation with friendly forces,” without specifying who those forces were. It also claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on the rebel side.</p><h2 id="link-2698a9a3">Is this linked to the regional conflict?</h2><p>While Syria has not been directly involved in the conflicts roiling the Middle East over the last year, its territory has long been a proxy battlefield for international powers.</p><p>For years, Israel has carried out deadly strikes in Syria, saying its targets are Iran-backed militants including the Lebanese group Hezbollah. Those attacks have escalated in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel from Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>The Israeli military has said some of these strikes aim to cut off the flow of weapons and intelligence between Hezbollah and Iran. Weapons and money have long flowed from Iran across Syria’s borders to Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The aftermath of an Israeli airstrike on the Iranian Embassy complex in the Syrian capital, Damascus, in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Firas Makdesi/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In April, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/world/middleeast/iran-airstrike-syria-funeral.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">a deadly Israeli strike</a> that hit part of the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus killed several senior Iranian commanders.</p><p>Iranian media reported on Thursday that a commander of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards force was killed in the rebels’ new offensive.</p><h2 id="link-604a56be">Who controls what in Syria?</h2><p>More than a decade of civil war, proxy battles and an invasion by the terror group Islamic State have left Syria carved up into different zones of control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>The government now controls more than 60 percent of the country, including most major cities. But that was not always the case.</p><p>At the height of the opposition’s strength in the civil war, and after the Islamic State overran parts of Syria, the government had lost control of most of the country.</p><p>But the tide turned in 2015 when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/world/middleeast/russian-soldiers-join-syria-fight.html" title="">Russia’s military directly intervened</a> to help Mr. Assad.</p><p>Still, large parts of the country are out of government control, including opposition-held areas in the northwest and the northeast, which is dominated by a Kurdish-led militia backed by the United States.</p><p>The opposition-controlled area of northwest Syria includes parts of Idlib and Aleppo provinces, and is home to about 5 million people. More than half of them were displaced from their homes elsewhere in Syria.</p><p>Though Islamic State <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/world/middleeast/isis-syria-caliphate.html" title="">lost</a> its last territorial foothold in Syria in 2019, it maintains sleeper cells believed to hide out in Syria’s vast desert and carry out occasional attacks on government soldiers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/10/world/middleeast/syria-truffles-war.html" title="">civilians</a>.</p><p>Muhammad Haj Kadour<!-- --> and <!-- -->Leily Nikounazar<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
