data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Israel and Hamas appeared close to an agreement to declare a cease-fire in Gaza and release hostages held there after over 15 months of war, the Qatari government said on Tuesday.</p><p>Mediators had “managed to minimize a lot of the disagreements between both parties,” Majed al-Ansari, the Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters. The talks on Tuesday were focused on “the final details of reaching an agreement,” he said.</p><p>The negotiations, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, come after months of failed attempts to achieve a breakthrough. In recent weeks, officials familiar with the talks have voiced mounting hopes that an agreement was possible, spurred by a looming deadline: the end of President Biden’s term and President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/politics/trump-hostages-hamas.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">has warned</a> that there would be “ALL HELL TO PAY” unless the hostages were freed by the time he became president. Officials in the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-hopes-america-sullivan.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">had been pressing</a> for a deal that would become part of the departing president’s legacy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If Hamas and Israel conclude a deal, it would bring some respite to Palestinians in Gaza, who have endured miserable conditions in displacement camps and relentless bombardments by Israel, and for the families of hostages abducted from Israel, who have worried for more than a year about the fate of their loved ones. A diplomat said the talks on Tuesday were focusing on addressing outstanding issues, while a Palestinian in touch with Hamas officials said they would center on details of how to enact an agreement. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.</p><p>The emerging agreement, the diplomat said, was heavily inspired by previous proposals discussed in May and July.</p><p>Mediators and officials have repeatedly warned that even substantial progress could be dashed at the last minute. Israel and Hamas have held numerous rounds of negotiations over the past several months, each of which ultimately broke down in mutual recrimination.</p><p>“We believe that we are at the final stages, but until we have an announcement — there will be no announcement,” said Mr. al-Ansari, adding that there was no immediate timeline for signing the deal.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>For over a year, international efforts have failed to end the war in Gaza, which was ignited by the October 2023 Hamas-led attack that killed around 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage to Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities. Israel launched a military campaign against Hamas that destroyed large areas of the enclave and killed at least 45,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Demonstrating in Tel Aviv on Monday for the release of hostages held in Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Itai Ron/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, confirmed the delicate talks were continuing Tuesday but declined to comment further.</p><p>Israeli officials told reporters Monday night that they believed they were close to reaching an agreement. That optimism was echoed by Mr. Biden in a speech in which he declared that the cease-fire and hostage deal was on “the brink” of “finally coming to fruition.”</p><p>William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, and Brett McGurk, a senior White House official, have crisscrossed the Middle East, pressing for a breakthrough in the talks. Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s pick for Middle East envoy, has also made trips to Qatar and Israel, meeting with top officials there.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
