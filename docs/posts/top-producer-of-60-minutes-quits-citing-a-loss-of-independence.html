data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>CBS News entered a new period of turmoil on Tuesday after the executive producer of “60 Minutes,” Bill Owens, said that he would resign from the long-running Sunday news program, citing encroachments on his journalistic independence.</p><p>In an extraordinary declaration, Mr. Owens — only the third person to run the program in its 57-year history — told his staff in a memo that “over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,’ right for the audience.”</p><p>“So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>“60 Minutes” has faced mounting pressure in recent months from both President Trump, who sued CBS for $10 billion and has <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114333660655935996" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused the program</a> of “unlawful and illegal behavior,” and its own corporate ownership at Paramount, the parent company of CBS News.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/media/paramount-trump-cbs-news-settlement.html" title="">eager to secure</a> the Trump administration’s approval for a multibillion-dollar sale of her company to Skydance, a company run by the son of the tech billionaire Larry Ellison. She has expressed a desire to settle Mr. Trump’s case, which stems from what the president has called a deceptively edited interview in October with Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on “60 Minutes.”</p><p>Legal experts have dismissed that suit as baseless and far-fetched. Many journalists at CBS News — the former home of Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace — believe that a settlement would amount to a capitulation to Mr. Trump over what they consider standard-issue gripes about editorial judgment.</p><p>A representative for Paramount declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Owens’s relationship with executives at CBS and Paramount frayed in recent months, and he has bristled at what he considered a series of intrusions into his editorial decisions, according to three people briefed on internal discussions who requested anonymity to share sensitive details.</p><p>Ms. Redstone complained to CBS executives in January about a “60 Minutes” segment on the war between Israel and Hamas, and a day later, the company appointed a veteran CBS producer, Susan Zirinsky, to a new role overseeing the news division’s journalistic standards.</p><p>In that capacity, Ms. Zirinsky reviewed “60 Minutes” segments that were deemed sensitive, including politically focused ones, before they aired, two of the people said. That kind of review is typical for many news programs, but “60 Minutes” prides itself on a long history of operating independently from the rest of CBS’s news division.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Owens, who had overseen the editing of the Harris interview, convened his staff in February to say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/business/media/cbs-news-60-minutes-trump.html" title="">he would not apologize</a> as part of any prospective settlement with Mr. Trump. His statement made some Paramount executives uneasy given the ongoing settlement talks.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/bill-owens/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Owens</a> also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/business/media/john-dickerson-maurice-dubois-cbs-evening-news.html" title="">led a recent overhaul</a> of “CBS Evening News,” the news division’s flagship weeknight show, which has seen a precipitous drop in ratings since the format changes were introduced this year.</p><p>At an emotional meeting with his staff on Tuesday, Mr. Owens said, “It’s clear the company is done with me,” according to multiple people who heard the remarks. The correspondents Lesley Stahl and Scott Pelley were in attendance, and Anderson Cooper dialed in from Rome, where he was covering Pope Francis’s death for CNN.</p><p>Rome Hartman, a veteran “60 Minutes” producer, said after the meeting that Mr. Owens’s exit was “a gut punch.”</p><p>“We all find it profoundly disturbing,” Mr. Hartman said in an interview. “If the people that run Paramount and CBS think they can run ‘60 Minutes’ better than Bill Owens has run it, they’re wrong.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Owens started at CBS as a summer intern in 1988, and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/media/60-minutes-bill-owens.html" title="">named</a> the executive producer of “60 Minutes” in 2019. In his memo on Tuesday, he pledged that the program “will continue to cover the new administration, as we will report on future administrations.” He added: “The show is too important to the country. It has to continue, just not with me as the executive producer.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has often singled out “60 Minutes” for scorn. In 2020, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/trump-lesley-stahl-60-minutes.html" title="">cut short</a> an interview with Lesley Stahl after he became displeased with her questions. He declined to be interviewed by the program during last year’s presidential campaign.</p><p>On April 13, apparently irked by that evening’s edition of the show, Mr. Trump accused “60 Minutes” of “fraudulent, beyond recognition, reporting” in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114333660655935996" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social media post</a> and urged his government regulators to strip CBS of its broadcast license. “CBS is out of control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this,” Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>Executives at Paramount and at Skydance took notice of the president’s angry comments, according to three people familiar with internal discussions. Settlement talks between Paramount and Mr. Trump are ongoing, and the two sides have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/media/trump-paramount-mediator-60-minutes.html" title="">chosen a mediator</a> to help resolve the case.</p><p>Wendy McMahon, the president of CBS News and Stations, wrote in a separate note on Tuesday that she remained “committed to ‘60 Minutes’ and to ensuring that the mission and the work remain our priority.”</p><p>She also praised Mr. Owens. “Standing behind what he stood for was an easy decision for me, and I never took for granted that he did the same for me,” she wrote.</p><p>David Enrich<!-- --> and <!-- -->Lauren Hirsch<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Michael M.
