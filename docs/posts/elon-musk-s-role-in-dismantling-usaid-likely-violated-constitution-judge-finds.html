    <h1>Elon Musk’s Role in Dismantling USAID Likely Violated Constitution, Judge Finds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Given that much of the agency’s work force and contracts have already been terminated, it was not immediately clear what effect the judge’s ruling would have. Only a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/usaid-job-cuts.html" title="">skeleton crew of workers</a> are still employed by the agency.</p><p>And while the order barred Mr. Musk from meddling with the agency personally, it suggested that he or others could continue to do so after receiving “the express authorization of a U.S.A.I.D. official with legal authority to take or approve the action.”</p><p>As early as Feb. 3, Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/usaid-trump-musk.html" title="">said he had assumed control</a> of the agency and had directed a variety of cuts in his own authority. The judge noted that Mr. Rubio could declare his intent to permanently close the agency’s headquarters within 14 days of his order, and the offices would remain closed.</p><p>But the finding that Mr. Musk had personally, and unlawfully, overseen the dismantling of the agency offered a firm rejection of his operation’s authority. In the sternly worded order, Judge Chuang warned that any skirting of its requirements could result in his holding Mr. Musk or members of his team in contempt.</p><p>Lawyers representing the government had previously argued in that case that the Department of Government Efficiency, or the U.S. DOGE Service, was in fact not headed by Mr. Musk and was serving in an advisory capacity. They said Mr. Musk had no authority to steer decisions on his own.</p></div></div>
