It is present in the placement of windows, offering glimpses of the city and the park. And it is present in the way that the new wing will connect to the adjacent galleries, emphasizing the connectivity between different regions, disciplines and civilizations.</p><p>“How can we start understanding the rhythm and the cadence that the museum has?” Escobedo said in a recent joint interview with Max Hollein, the museum’s director, in his Met office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The challenge was to weave these connections with the existing museum and adjacent wings and also to make connections with the park in a very subtle way,” she continued. The current campus “is very complex — it looks like a medieval town with plazas and towns and squares and little alleys, where you can get lost, which could be fascinating, but also very disorienting.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The architect Frida Escobedo and Max Hollein, director of the Met, looking over a model of the new Tang Wing for Modern and contemporary art that Escobedo is designing.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>At a time when museums all over the world are rethinking how they present art for a modern audience, Escobedo’s design marks a significant step forward for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/arts/design/the-metropolitan-museum-will-delay-a-new-600-million-wing.html" title="">long-delayed</a> Met project. It also represents a do-over; a previous design by the architect David Chipperfield, who was selected for the job in 2015, was jettisoned after ballooning in cost to as much as $800 million.</p><p>Personally, the project catapults the career of Escobedo, a 45-year-old architect from Mexico City who is the first woman to design a wing in the museum’s 154-year history.</p><p>And the design significantly advances the Met’s goal to set right its presentation of Modern and contemporary art, which has long seemed like an afterthought in a corner of the museum — isolated and cut off from the rest of the Fifth Avenue building — and has failed to effectively showcase the museum’s holdings.</p><p>“This has been a priority for the museum for quite some time — to really have proper galleries for the Met’s collection of modern and contemporary art,” Hollein said. “The Met has had a commitment toward the art of its time from the very beginning of its history. That’s differentiated us from the Louvre, from the British Museum, the Prado and all these other places. They don’t have their collections going up to this current moment.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Rendering shows the Tang Wing wrapped in a stone lattice exterior.

Tang and H.M. Agnes Hsu-Tang Wing after that couple’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/arts/design/met-museum-modern-wing-gift.html" title="">lead donation</a> of $125 million, will increase gallery space by nearly 50 percent, with more than 70,000 square feet; address accessibility, infrastructure and sustainability; and provide an architecturally distinctive home for the Met’s collection of 20th- and 21st-century art.</p><p>The new five-story wing will replace the existing Lila Acheson Wallace wing and remain within its footprint, which was achieved by removing back of house areas and moving offices, storage and art handling out of the wing. And it will sit lower than the Great Hall, the majestic 1902 main entry and the tallest point of the museum.</p><p>The project is expected to cost about $500 million and to open in 2030. In May 2024, the Museum <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/arts/design/met-museum-fund-raising-modern-wing.html" title="">announced</a> it had reached its fund-raising milestone of $550 million in private donations for the wing (the Met is raising an additional $150 million for an endowment to support the addition’s operating costs).</p><p>To achieve a sense of weaving in the project, Escobedo said she drew on her birthplace, Mexico City, which she described as “a very, very layered city.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“It comes from layering in terms of the materiality, cultural layering and also the idea of coexisting with a landscape and translating specific forms or shapes or typologies of architecture and making them our own,” she added. “And also the idea of a past that is living in the present, something that is constantly evolving and changing.”</p><p>David Breslin, the Met’s curator in charge of Modern and contemporary art, who has been working closely with Escobedo, in an interview called the weaving concept “beautiful.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frida Escobedo, the architect designing the Tang Wing, with a Josef Albers oil on Masonite, “Homage to the Square: Dilated,” from 1969.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Estate of Josef Albers/Artists Rights Society (ARS) New York; Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Just as museums like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/arts/design/moma-redesign-art-expansion.html" title="">the Museum of Modern Art</a> and the Whitney have moved away from didactic storytelling with their new buildings — abandoning delineated discipline areas and bringing in more diverse voices — the Escobedo design encourages a sense of personal discovery. “Frida’s architecture frequently asks you to ask yourself where you are,” Breslin said. “You don’t feel like you’re being led, you’re invited to move forward or to change directions. There is a lot of freedom to the way she’s designed the wing.”</p><p>At the same time, the Met wanted the galleries to be defined, so Escobedo has varied their ceiling heights and dimensions, which Hollein said creates the “drama of space unfolding.”</p><p>Whereas the existing wing by Kevin Roche seems to turn its back to the park, the new design calls for the facade to have a greater porosity and, in some cases, transparency, with new windows or veiled openings with views to the park and new landscaping.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>“It’s more approachable,” Escobedo said. “That was part of the intention — to make people feel invited.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Above, rendering of the textured stone facade of the new Tang Wing, looking west. “The Met has had a commitment toward the art of its time from the very beginning of its history,” said Max Hollein, the museum’s director. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Filippo Bolognese Images; via Frida Escobedo Studio</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Because the Met sits on city land and its exterior has landmark designation, the new wing’s design will have to go through a public approval process. But the museum has already been paving the way with various stakeholders, some of whom have been wary about changes to the existing structure and how they might impact the surrounding park.</p><p>“We have long supported the Met’s effort to upgrade the Modern and contemporary Art Wing,” said Betsy Smith, the president and chief executive of the Central Park Conservancy, in a statement to The Times. “The Met has been receptive to our concerns and we appreciate the changes they have made over the course of the design process for the new wing, including being attentive to its mass and its impact on the park, which have resulted in a better design.”</p><p>Nuha E. Ansari, the executive director of Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, said the Met’s “arguments for why they need the new wing are quite compelling since it seems Roche’s Wallace Wing can’t be reworked to fit the museum’s current needs.” She added that Escobedo’s “ideas for improving circulation between the older wings and the new seem well conceived.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Frida Escobedo, the architect of the new Tang Wing, which will be completed in 2030.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Vincent Tullo for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Escobedo’s design, which connects to the Met’s adjacent galleries with eight entrances, draws on the museum’s architectural past. Featuring a three-story base with a recessed fourth floor and a further set back fifth floor, the scaled facade nods to the 1971 Roche Dinkeloo master plan, which is visible in the seven buildings designed by Roche. The design also integrates elements from the Beaux-Arts Fifth Avenue facade designed by Richard Morris Hunt and McKim, Mead and White.</p><p><a href="https://fridaescobedo.com/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Escobedo Studio</a>, the lead design architect, is working in collaboration with Beyer Blinder Belle Architects &amp; Planners; Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects; and the engineering firms Kohler Ronan and Thornton Tomasetti.</p><p>The Tang Wing is adjacent to the newly renovated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/arts/design/met-rockefeller-wing-renovation.html" title="">Michael C.

Lauder. It will also provide an official debut to some of the 220 artworks by Philip Guston, one of America’s most influential postwar painters, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/arts/design/philip-guston-met-museum-gift.html" title="">that were donated to the Met in 2022 by his daughter, Musa Mayer</a>.</p><p>But Hollein said acquisitions are not a significant rationale for the Met’s reimagining of its home for Modern and contemporary art. “The main purpose of this building is not to attract collections,” he said. The purpose is to “provide the proper environment to tell the stories and to display the collections that we already have, and to further expand on that.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Robin Pogrebin, who has been a reporter for The Times for nearly 30 years, covers arts and culture.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/robin-pogrebin">More about Robin Pogrebin</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Art and Museums in New York City</h2><h3>A guide to the shows, exhibitions and artists shaping the city’s cultural landscape.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Cracking the Code of the Art World:</strong> Ouattara Watts, a seminal but overlooked artist, stayed under the radar for decades.
