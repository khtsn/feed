Another said: “bob tiktok is knocking on heaven’s door.”</p><p>Dylan, appearing to get in on the joke, posted a second video on Thursday. This time he posted <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bobdylan/video/7460547190566522155" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a six-second black-and-white clip</a> of himself appearing at a news conference in the 1960s and saying, “Good God, I must leave right away.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Dylan is currently having <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/nyregion/bob-dylan-nemesis.html" title="">a moment in Hollywood</a> thanks in part to “‘A Complete Unknown,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/25/movies/a-complete-unknown-review.html" title="">a biopic starring Timothée Chalamet</a>. He has been known to dabble in social media. He joined X, <a href="https://x.com/bobdylan?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">then called Twitter, in 2009</a>, and sometimes shares his random thoughts, reactions to news, or promotional materials. There is also an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bobdylan/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official Dylan Instagram account</a>, on which he posts clips from his extended career and other memorabilia.</p><p>His arrival to TikTok in its possible 11th hour has sparked joy in some fans, with at least one commenter calling on him to save the app.</p><p>TikTok <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/supreme-court-tiktok-ban-law.html" title="">appeared before the Supreme Court</a> last week challenging the law forcing a sale or ban, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/technology/bytedance-tiktok-ban-bill.html" title="">signed by President Biden in April</a> because of concerns that the Chinese government could manipulate its content to gain access to user data. There are more than 170 million users in the United States. But President-elect Donald J. Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/trump-tiktok-executive-order.html" title="">said to be considering an executive order</a> that could allow the app to continue operating.</p><p>Even if the app is officially banned by Sunday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/tiktok-ban.html" title="">it is unlikely to immediately disappear</a>, giving Dylan’s fans more time to enjoy his content, should he continue to post.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Find the Right Soundtrack for You</h2><h3>Trying to expand your musical horizons?
