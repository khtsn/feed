Last year, U.S. prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/nyregion/nikhil-gupta-india-assassination-plot.html" title="">charged the man accused of being Mr. Yadav’s henchman, Nikhil Gupta</a>, and said Mr. Gupta had acted under instructions from an unidentified employee of the Indian government. Now, prosecutors have charged Mr. Yadav with orchestrating the plot.</p><p>The indictment came just days after the Canadian government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/world/canada/india-canada-diplomats.html" title="">expelled India’s top diplomat</a> and five others, saying they were part of a criminal network.</p><p>Canada’s action stemmed from the killing last year in that country of a prominent Sikh cleric, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was ambushed and shot in his pickup truck in Surrey, British Columbia.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The Canadian government has said the Indian government was behind that killing, just as U.S. authorities have blamed Indian authorities for the plot to kill the New York-based activist. The U.S. has shared intelligence with Canada as the two countries have investigated, officials said.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the general counsel for a New York-based group called Sikhs for Justice, in November of last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sarah Blesener for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>U.S. authorities say that after Mr. Nijjar’s killing, Mr. Yadav sent Mr. Gupta a news article about the New York target, which Mr. Yadav called a “priority now.” The person Mr. Gupta tried to enlist to carry out the killing, however, notified U.S. law enforcement, which set up a sting operation leading to the first indictment.</p><p>Mr. Gupta was arrested last year in the Czech Republic and extradited to the United States to face trial. He pleaded not guilty at a court appearance this summer. U.S. authorities believe Mr. Yadav is in India. Both men are now charged with murder for hire and conspiring to launder money.</p><p>The evidence detailed in the indictment paints a chilling portrait of a government aspiring to kill critics who live in North America, with Mr. Gupta suggesting at various points that the two targets were the start of a longer, bloodier campaign of killings of Sikh separatists living outside India.</p><p>“We have so many targets,” Mr. Gupta told the federal agent he had unwittingly hired to do the killing, the indictment said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said this week that he had recently pressed India’s leader, Narendra Modi, for cooperation in the investigation.</p><p>“I impressed upon him that it needed to be taken very, very seriously,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters. That entreaty apparently did not succeed, and days later Canada expelled half a dozen Indian officials. In response, India expelled an equal number of Canadian diplomats.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
