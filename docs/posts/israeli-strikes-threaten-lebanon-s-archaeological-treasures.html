When he grew up, he got the same job his father had, running the lights that illuminate the towering columns at night.</p><p>But as Israeli airstrikes crept closer to the site, his family was forced to flee earlier this month. Days later, a missile landed yards away from the temple complex, obliterating a centuries-old Ottoman-era building.</p><p>“My entire world went black,” said Mr. Kanso.</p><p>Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah has triggered a humanitarian crisis. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-displaced-hezbollah.html" title="">Almost a quarter of Lebanon’s population</a> of about five million has been displaced and more than 3,700 people have been killed, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But it has also gravely threatened the tiny Mediterranean nation’s antiquities, a shared source of pride in a country long divided by sectarian strife.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The temple complex of Baalbek, which is <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/294/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed by UNESCO</a> as a World Heritage Site, is just one of the sites that are at risk. Archaeologists, conservationists and even the Lebanese military are now racing to protect thousands of years worth of Phoenician, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman treasures.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Lebanese troops piling up sandbags around an ancient water well during a drill at an army base near Beirut.

Lebanon’s cash-strapped government would be forced to juggle the extensive cost of restoration with a deepening humanitarian crisis, and there remains uncertainty over whether a truce could hold and how restoration of these sites would fit in. </p><p>“They are destroying memory,” said Joanne Farchakh Bajjaly, a Lebanese archaeologist who runs Biladi, an organization focused on preserving the country’s heritage. She compared the damage from Israeli strikes to that carried out by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/world/asia/afghanistan-bamiyan-buddhas.html" title="">Taliban in Afghanistan</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/world/middleeast/destruction-of-antiquities-by-militants-is-denounced.html" title="">Islamic State in Iraq</a>.</p><p>When asked whether Israel deliberately targets cultural sites, the Israeli military said in a statement that it strikes in Lebanon only when necessary, adding that sensitive sites are taken into account during military planning and that each “goes through a rigorous approval process.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Israel has accused Hezbollah of embedding in civilian areas, including near cultural heritage sites.

Youssef Haydar is spearheading these efforts. He leads a specialist regiment that has been transporting artifacts out of the country’s hard-hit south, including some dating back to the Roman and Byzantine civilizations.</p><p>At the regiment’s base, a few miles outside Beirut, General Haydar’s troops<strong> </strong>conducted drills in which they piled sandbags on top of real-life artifacts, including a sarcophagus, a strategy designed to protect them from shrapnel or the shock waves of nearby blasts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The more you sweat,” General Haydar said, as he watched his troops, “the less you bleed in war.”</p><p>There has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/world/middleeast/lebanon-destruction.html" title="">wide-scale destruction</a> in dozens of historic border towns, archaeologists said, that has damaged or destroyed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-border-photos-video.html" title="">entire</a> areas. Strikes have also expanded to include the centers of big cities, including in Baalbek and Tyre, where Hezbollah enjoys considerable support.</p><p>The large-scale destruction of towns and cities has even disturbed the dead. Historic cemeteries in Lebanon also have been damaged or destroyed amid Israel’s offensive, many of them considered heritage sites by archaeologists. The Israeli military said in at least one case that a Hezbollah tunnel compound had been built underneath a cemetery in southern Lebanon.</p><p>“It’s not collateral damage,” General Haydar said. “Why the cemeteries? This is heritage.
