But Mr. Egbert, 21, has since walked away from the sport. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/sports/olympics/paralympics-sexual-abuse.html" title="">He said in a federal lawsuit</a> in 2022 that he was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by his Paralympic teammate, including at the Tokyo Games.</p><p>With another Paralympics now underway in Paris, he is asserting that the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee knowingly put him in danger by assigning him to room with the teammate, whose conduct at least six other athletes had previously complained about to the U.S.O.P.C., according to a new court filing from Egbert’s lawyers. Among the complaints, according to the filing, was a report of sexual misconduct made by another Paralympic swimmer a year before the Tokyo Games.</p><p>“Parker is thrilled to see his teammates fulfill their dreams, but he also feels a devastating loss because he will never return to competitive swimming after the horrific abuse he endured,” Mr. Egbert’s mother, Laura Egbert, said in a statement to The New York Times.</p><p>“We were shocked to find out during discovery in this lawsuit the number, and severity, of complaints that other athletes made,” she said. Egbert is now seeking punitive damages against the U.S.O.P.C., which manages U.S. Paralympics Swimming.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>A spokesman for the organization said it took athlete safety and all reports of abuse seriously but declined to comment on Egbert’s claims because the lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>Two years after sports safety authorities received Mr. Egbert’s report of abuse, that case also remains unresolved. The delay has renewed concerns about the effectiveness of that complaint system, created in 2017 in response to the revelation that the former physician for the American gymnastics team, Lawrence G. Nassar, had sexually abused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/sports/olympics/nassar-abuse-gymnasts-settlement.html" title="">hundreds of gymnasts</a>.</p><p>The U.S. Center for SafeSport, the nonprofit organization directed by Congress to handle accusations of misconduct in Olympic and Paralympic sports, began investigating Mr. Egbert’s allegations in August 2022 but has not yet issued a final decision. If the organization finds wrongdoing, it can issue penalties ranging from a written warning to permanent ineligibility.</p><p>SafeSport has been criticized by athletes, elected officials and sport governing bodies who have said that its investigations take too long and that there is not enough transparency about the process, which led to the organization <a href="https://uscenterforsafesport.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Process-Improvement-Announcement-3_28_24-FINAL.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">making changes</a> to how it handles cases earlier this year.</p><p>SafeSport’s chief executive, Ju’Riese Colón, said during a Congressional hearing in March that Mr. Egbert’s case had not been resolved because SafeSport was working to access depositions and discovery from the civil suit “to avoid the need to re-interview potential trauma survivors.” Mr. Egbert’s lawyers, Elizabeth Kramer and Frank Salzano, said that SafeSport “is certainly failing to give Parker or his fellow athletes any assurance that it can fulfill its congressional mandate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Egbert initially named SafeSport as a defendant in his lawsuit, but his lawyers later voluntarily dismissed those claims. A judge in a past case ruled that SafeSport has “absolute immunity” in such cases.</p><p>Mr. Egbert, who has autism and an intellectual disability, said in his lawsuit that the two-time gold medalist and world-record holder Robert Griswold violently raped him during the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021 and later at the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. In August 2022, Mr. Egbert left the training center after telling his parents that Mr. Griswold had sexually abused him.</p><p>Mr. Griswold, who has cerebral palsy, has been temporarily suspended while he is being investigated by SafeSport, meaning that he is ineligible to compete in this year’s Paralympics. His lawyer, John Chanin, said in a statement that Mr. Griswold, who is also a defendant in Mr. Egbert’s lawsuit, “vehemently denies” physically or sexually abusing Mr. Egbert and called the accusations “unfounded.” Chanin said a confidentiality order from the court prevented him from responding in more detail to Mr. Egbert’s accusations.</p><p>Mr. Griswold, 27, had been the subject of misconduct accusations before Mr. Egbert lodged his complaints. In September 2020, SafeSport’s disciplinary database indicated Mr. Griswold was under temporary restrictions because of an accusation against him.</p><p>Mr. Egbert’s lawyers provided more details about that complaint in their recent court filings: A blind female swimmer who was underage at the time reported to U.S.O.P.C. officials that she was in an elevator with Mr. Griswold at the training center when he touched her behind and her neck in a “very sexual” way without her consent. She said Mr. Griswold had later sent her a text message saying that he wanted to have sex.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The female swimmer declined an interview request from The Times through her lawyers, who also represent Mr. Egbert. She has not filed a lawsuit.</p><p>Mr. Egbert’s lawyers said SafeSport did not interview the female swimmer in response to her accusations. SafeSport barred Mr. Griswold from the Colorado Springs training center for six months, but only cited his giving alcohol to the female swimmer as the reason for his punishment, according to Mr. Egbert’s court filing. Mr. Griswold was cleared to participate in the Tokyo Games.</p><p>A spokeswoman for SafeSport declined to address its handling of the female swimmer’s case or Mr. Egbert’s, saying that the organization does not comment on specific investigations in order to protect the integrity of its process.</p><p>In May 2021, according to Mr. Egbert’s court filing, five athletes told the U.S.O.P.C. that they opposed Mr. Griswold’s return to the training center, saying that he frequently made them feel uncomfortable and invaded their personal space. Also that month, according to the filing, a group of athletes asked the U.S.O.P.C. not to allow Mr. Griswold to be present during their workouts because he made them feel uncomfortable but the organization did not take action.</p><p>Mr. Griswold began grooming Mr. Egbert, who has the mental capacity of a 5- to 8-year-old, at the U.S. Paralympic trials in June 2021, according to Mr. Egbert’s lawsuit. At the Tokyo Games, the U.S.O.P.C. allowed Mr. Griswold to act as Mr. Egbert’s personal care assistant, an accommodation for athletes who require help with daily activities or their athletic preparation, according to court filings. Mr. Egbert said that Mr. Griswold had forced him to let Mr. Griswold shave Mr. Egbert’s pubic area before his races, a role that a personal care assistant may fill.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>After Mr. Egbert filed his lawsuit, a U.S.O.P.C. aquatics coach reported to U.S.O.P.C. officials that earlier she had observed Mr. Egbert leaving the locker room at the training center in tears after entering the showers with Mr. Griswold, according to Mr. Egbert’s filings. She said that Mr. Griswold spoke for Mr. Egbert and led him out of the locker room, the filings said. Mr. Egbert said in his lawsuit that Mr. Griswold raped him in the showers.</p><p>The U.S.O.P.C. said that when it learned of Mr. Egbert’s accusations of sexual abuse against Mr. Griswold from Mr. Egbert’s mother in August 2022, it immediately contacted local police and SafeSport and removed Mr. Griswold from the training center and suspended him from the national team.</p><p>A spokesman for the Colorado Springs police department said that Mr. Egbert’s case was still open but inactive. Police records <a href="https://swimswam.com/no-arrest-no-safesport-update-robert-griswolds-abuse-case-remains-in-limbo-1-year-later/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first published</a> by the website SwimSwam, and verified by the department, refer to a shortage of witnesses and corroborating evidence. Mr. Egbert’s lawyers said that he was interviewed and gave police his medical records.</p><p>Since he told his parents he was sexually abused by Mr. Griswold, Mr. Egbert has needed surgery to address pain and damage to his rectum, has been receiving therapy and has withdrawn from the sport that once brought him pride and a sense of belonging, his lawyers said.</p><p>“Our family asks that while you are rooting for Team U.S.A., also demand safety and accountability for the athletes who inspire us,” Laura Egbert said.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
