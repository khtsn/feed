Ms. Sunga described the intense interest in the festival as both “exciting” and “terrifying.”</p><p>A spectacular variety of cakes adorned the tables, including: a light lemon cake with passion fruit filling, a tower made out of smaller spongecakes, Jell-O cake, pink champagne cake, a kid-baked dinosaur pyramid cake, and plenty of desserts with flowery ornaments.</p><p>In the first hour, picnickers placed their cakes on stands and crammed them onto the tables. Then, after the arranging was complete, came that fleeting and glorious moment: The crowd gawked and took photos of the 1,387 cakes, both sweet and savory, in their pristine, unsliced form.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>More than 1,300 cakes were brought to the event on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Morton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Cake Picnic is organized to have no leftovers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Morton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>After the photos were taken, the ensuing buffet was an act of controlled chaos.</p><p>Smaller groups went up for cakewalks.

Hundreds of people responded.</p><p>After the first event in April 2024, she took the cake show on the road, first to Los Angeles, then to New York and then back to San Francisco in November — “places with cake communities,” she said. At the last picnic, 613 cakes were on display.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It’s not my full-time job, but I would love to travel full time for cake,” said Ms. Sunga, who works at Google. “It’s taken on a life of its own.”</p><p>Ms. Sunga, who brought two red velvet cakes of her own, said chefs from well-known bakeries, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/dining/tartine-bakery-elisabeth-prueitt.html" title="">Tartine</a> and <a href="https://susiecakes.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooX_vk-ElDTD-yOBZDC3adgfHIuMW45WTVLtVWSCRVUkoUxLeES" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SusieCakes</a>, attended.</p><p>The Legion of Honor, the picnic venue, opened a special exhibit last week, <a href="https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/wayne-thiebaud" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Wayne Thiebaud: Art Comes from Art,”</a> celebrating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/obituaries/wayne-thiebaud-dead.html" title="">Mr. Thiebaud, who died in 2021</a> and is most famous for his decadent paintings of cakes and confections.</p><p>The Cake Picnic aimed to turn his dessert still lifes into a “living tribute,” according to the museum’s website.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elise Wong points to a cake she liked.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Morton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Joyce Lim, 32, who lives in San Francisco, called herself a Cake Picnic “groupie.” She said that she has baked for every Cake Picnic so far and will attend future picnics set for London and New York.

Her cake might just top her previous elaborate entries: a kabocha cake layered with ginger-poached pears and miso-caramel cream cheese frosting, and a smörgåstårta, a Swedish cake with rye layers, hard-boiled eggs and caper filling.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Brenna Fallon, one of dozens of volunteers at the picnic, said that the brief period after the cakes are laid out and before the buffet begins is an “‘Alice in Wonderland’ moment.”</p><p>“Everybody is just gleefully going through the aisles,” said Ms. Fallon, 34, who is from Walnut Creek, Calif. “People are plotting — which cakes do they want to make a beeline for when they get in?”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-22"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Victoria Dossett, who goes by the stage name VictoriAccordia, plays the accordion for the cakes on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Laura Morton for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Ms. Fallon, an amateur baker who brought an Earl Grey chocolate cake with a salty buttercream, said that a feeling of celebration was in the air.</p><p>“It’s a slice of life,” she said. “It feels like a big picnic with a bunch of friends you just don’t know yet.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
