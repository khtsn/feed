The pair worked out at the gym, got tacos and played video games together. They exchanged elbow bumps.</p><p>“It’s like Luke got a bro to hang out with,” said Mr. Ferris’s mother, Lena, from their home in Falls Church, Va.</p><p>Then suddenly, after four years, Mr. Orellana, who goes by Alex, was gone, locked up in an immigration detention center nearly 2,000 miles away.</p><p>A permanent U.S. resident, or green card holder, Mr. Orellana is facing deportation for trying to swindle a store out of $200 eight years ago when, his wife said, he was struggling with substance abuse.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The detention of Mr. Orellana and other green card holders is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration is expanding far beyond people who are in the country illegally. Tasked with fulfilling President Trump’s campaign promise to carry out mass deportations, federal agents have been detaining permanent U.S. residents convicted of years-old minor offenses and moving to deport them.</p><p>Their families are reeling, as are some of the people they work for, like the Ferrises, who had come to rely on, and even cherish, Mr. Orellana’s care for Luke.</p><p>Ms. Ferris recently flew to Texas to visit Mr. Orellana, who is being held at the El Valle detention center there.</p><p>“How could anyone support getting rid of an amazing person providing a vital service to an American?” asked Ms. Ferris, who noted that her son’s care — and thus Mr. Orellana’s salary — is covered by Medicaid.</p><p>A labor shortage looms over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/business/economy/immigrant-workers-deportation-fears.html" title="">fast-growing industry that provides care to senior</a> and disabled Americans, and immigrants like Mr. Orellana have been a key source of workers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>But under Mr. Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has taken a sprawling view of who should be targeted for deportation. A D.H.S. document reviewed by The New York Times said that Mr. Orellana was subject to removal from the United States for obtaining $200 “by false pretenses.”</p><p>Under immigration law, that constitutes a crime involving “moral turpitude” that can place a green card holder at risk of deportation, especially on re-entering the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 769w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/08/multimedia/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt/00nat-immig-greencardholders-2-hclt-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1537w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/ceeafd71-42b6-5f80-84ea-c04e3ef50ac7" decoding="async" width="600" height="800"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Luke Ferris, right, and Alfredo Orellana, his caretaker.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>At the time of his trouble with the law, Mr. Orellana was in his early 20s and abusing drugs. After being convicted, he went to rehab. He became a peer supporter to others in recovery and found a calling caring for developmentally disabled people, according to his wife and employer.</p><p>Green card holders convicted of certain crimes can be deported. But the government has usually opted not to target those people unless they have committed particularly serious crimes, according to legal experts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Orellana’s lawyer, Ben Osorio, compared arresting green card holders like his client to ticketing people for driving five miles over the speed limit, and fining everyone who jaywalks.</p><p>“We are living in an era of maximum enforcement,” he said.</p><p>Having a green card is a necessary step toward citizenship. As of 2023, there were 13 million green card holders in the United States. About nine million of them were eligible to become citizens, because they had been permanent residents for at least five years or had been married to a citizen for three years.</p><p>But many green card holders opt not to pursue citizenship. The application is expensive and the process is bureaucratic, requiring interviews with federal officials, extensive paperwork and a civics exam. Now, though, the difference between legal “permanent” residency and citizenship has become strikingly clear to many green card holders.</p><p>“It is an erroneous expectation that you are guaranteed to be here indefinitely when you have a green card,” said Gerald L. Neuman, an immigration scholar at Harvard Law School.</p><p>Green card holders concerned about being ensnared in the same dragnet as Mr. Orellana and others have flooded lawyers with queries. Several lawyers said they had been advising those with even minor offenses on their record to avoid international trips. Many of those people had traveled abroad without any problem before Mr. Trump took office, the lawyers said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Erlin Richards, a green card holder since 1992, was returning from a vacation in the Dominican Republic last month when he was detained at Kennedy Airport in New York, based on a 2006 conviction for marijuana possession in Texas. He had paid a fine and never spent a day behind bars, said his lawyer, Michael Z. Goldman.</p><p>In the two decades since he was convicted, Mr. Richards, 43, an electrician from the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent who has three U.S.-born children, said that he had been to Canada and his home country. But that was before Mr. Trump entered office.</p><p>In a phone interview from immigration detention in Elizabeth, N.J., he said that a federal officer at J.F.K. suggested that he had no discretion to let him go. “Haven’t you been watching the news? Trump is president now. We have to detain you,” Mr. Richards recalled being told.</p><p>His lawyer, Mr. Goldman, pointed out that “he’s locked up for carrying a substance that is legal in many states, including his home state of New York.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Orellana’s wife, Anita, is six months pregnant with their first child.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Mr. Orellana, the caregiver, had traveled to South America to visit family, and last year he vacationed in Costa Rica with his wife, Anita, who is American. He cleared passport inspection on his return to the United States, where he has lived since age 4, and resumed caring for Mr. Ferris 40 hours a week.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In January, the couple flew to El Salvador to visit Ms. Orellana’s relatives. By the time they landed at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, Mr. Trump was in the White House.</p><p>At passport control, Mr. Orellana was taken aside by the authorities. He was kept for 12 hours in a room with his wife, she said, and instructed to return on Feb. 20 with official court documents.</p><p>The couple returned to Dulles with the documents, expecting that the matter would be settled. Instead, agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement took Mr. Orellana into custody.</p><p>“We were so shocked. We just could not believe it. We were both sobbing,” recalled his wife, an administrator at a clinic who is six months pregnant.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Mr. Orellana was detained for two weeks in Virginia before being roused at 3 a.m. to board a bus to Pennsylvania. From there he was flown, shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, to Louisiana, his wife said. Then he was transferred to Raymondville, Texas, some 240 miles southeast of San Antonio near the U.S.-Mexico border, where he remains.</p><p>Ms. Orellana said that she was trying to “push through” in spite of the toll that the ordeal had taken on her. They have a mortgage and car payments to keep up with.</p><p>The Ferris family canceled the baby shower that they had planned for the couple. Their hope is that Mr. Orellana will win his case in immigration court on April 25 and arrive home before his daughter’s due date, July 4.</p><p>Back in Virginia, Luke Ferris has three sisters he adores, but his relationship with Mr. Orellana is unique.</p><p>“Luke never had a person his age spend that much time with him,” Ms. Ferris said. “Alex taught him what it is to be and have a friend,” she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Luke longs for Mr. Orellana, and repeatedly asks, “Where’s Alex? Where’s Alex?” His parents have decided to tell him that his pal was visiting his ailing grandfather.</p><p>As the confinement dragged on, Ms. Ferris started writing her son letters, pretending to be Mr. Orellana. Luke receives them with glee and hangs them on the lime-green wall by his desk.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Letters penned by Ms. Ferris, pretending to be Luke’s caregiver.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“I’m sorry my phone is broken,” said one recent letter, in which “Mr. Orellana” justified not calling. “I should be home in late April or May. Please start up my car and visit the cats.”</p><p>Luke Ferris visits Mr. Orellana’s house weekly to complete the tasks.</p><p>And every day, he wonders aloud whether another letter has arrived.</p><p>“Mailman?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Miriam Jordan reports from a grass roots perspective on immigrants and their impact on the demographics, society and economy of the United States.</p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/homeland-security-department">Homeland Security Department</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2025/04/09/us/immigration-green-card-crackdown-trump.html">273</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of U.S. Immigration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong> An Accidental Journey to a Salvadoran Prison:</strong> Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s story began six years ago, and took an even darker turn when he was recently deported — even though a judge had already decided he could remain in the United States, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/el-salvador-deportation-migrant-trump.html">concerned he might be tortured in his homeland</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detained Woman Dies: </strong>A Chinese woman detained by U.S. border officers for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/chinese-woman-detained-suicide-border.html">overstaying a visitor visa</a> died by suicide while being held at a border patrol station in Arizona, a Democratic congresswoman said.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservative Voices Raise Alarm:</strong> As the administration has rushed to carry out deportations as quickly as possible, the unified front in favor of President Trump’s immigration purge is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-immigration-joe-rogan-conservatives.html">beginning to crack</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nobel Laureate’s Visa Revoked: </strong>Óscar Arias Sánchez, twice president of Costa Rica, has been a vocal critic of Trump.
