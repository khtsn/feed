Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, warned last year about the prospect of people asking lawmakers to comment after a tragedy and saying, “You were warned and you voted for it anyway.”</p><p>Mr. Kaine’s prognostication, which was made just before Congress voted to add five new round-trip routes to Reagan, proved painfully true this week, after 67 people perished in a fiery collision above the Potomac. Divers on Friday were still searching for bodies in the water.</p><p>The new helicopter route closures, which were told to the airspace’s approved users on Thursday but not announced more broadly until Friday, effectively block off helicopter access to the north and south of the airport, said a helicopter pilot who was briefed on the decision by an F.A.A. email alert and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential message. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The F.A.A. gave no end time for the restrictions.</p><p>The change cuts off parts of two aerial routes commonly used by military and law-enforcement helicopter pilots along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. A rarely used portion of a third route that crosses directly over the airport is also now curtailed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The new F.A.A. restrictions make exceptions for helicopter flights that are tending to medical emergencies that involve key government officials or are related to national-security missions.</p><p>Senator Tammy Duckworth, the Democrat of Illinois who piloted Black Hawk helicopters during her military career, described the curtailments in an interview as “a wise decision for now.”</p><p>The newly restricted helicopter routes are a roughly four-mile-long section of what is called Route 1, which stretches from the Memorial Bridge on the Potomac River to the South Capitol Street Bridge on the Anacostia River, and the entire four-and-a-half-mile-long Route 4 from Hains Point to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge on the Potomac.</p><p>The Army helicopter that collided with the civilian airliner had flown along the now-closed section of Route 1 and had just turned onto Route 4 south of Hains Point when the crash occurred.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>In a news briefing at the White House on Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the helicopter was doing “routine annual retraining” at night along “a standard corridor for a continuity of government mission.”</p><p>The Army on Friday identified two of the three crew members who were aboard the Black Hawk as Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Md., the helicopter’s co-pilot; and Staff Sgt. Ryan O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Ga., the Black Hawk crew chief. The identity of a third crew member, a female pilot whose remains appear not yet to have been recovered, were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/army-helicopter-crew.html" title="">withheld at the request of her family</a>, a break from standard practice.</p><p>Army officials said on Friday that the female pilot was undergoing her annual evaluation flight with Warrant Officer Eaves serving as her evaluator.</p><p>Such flights practice carrying high-ranking officials to safe locations away from Washington should the nation’s capital come under attack.</p><p>Those “continuity of government” flights would almost certainly fall under the exception made for “national security missions,” according to the pilot who received the F.A.A. notice.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>At a news conference early Friday evening, officials at the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the collision, were asked whether airspaces that host a combination of civilian and military aircraft should be re-examined.</p><p>“I can’t give you a definitive answer on that,” said J. Todd Inman, an agency member who is involved in the investigation. “What I can say is, in this incident, it should not have happened.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>John Ismay is a reporter covering the Pentagon for The Times.
