Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, warned last year about the prospect of people asking lawmakers to comment after a tragedy and saying, “You were warned and you voted for it anyway.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="Optimistic-4"><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
