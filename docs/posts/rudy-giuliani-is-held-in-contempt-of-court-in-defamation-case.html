    <h1>Rudy Giuliani Is Held in Contempt of Court in Defamation Case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A federal judge on Monday held Rudolph W. Giuliani in contempt of court for failing to cooperate in the handover of $11 million of his personal assets to Georgia poll workers he falsely accused of helping to steal the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has so far failed to turn over the bulk of his personal assets as a down payment on the $148 million judgment the poll workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, won in a defamation lawsuit.</p><p>The judge has yet to detail what specific sanctions Mr. Giuliani faces. But being held in contempt could possibly hinder the former mayorâ€™s attempts to hang onto his Palm Beach, Fla., condo.</p><p>The assets include a 10-room apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan; a 1980 Mercedes-Benz convertible; a collection of 26 designer watches; and rare Yankees collectibles, the most valuable of which might be a signed and framed Joe DiMaggio jersey.</p></div></div>
