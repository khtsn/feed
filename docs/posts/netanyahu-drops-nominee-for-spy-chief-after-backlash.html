But the Israeli leader dropped Mr. Sharvit a day after the Monday announcement amid a backlash from the right, partly because he had written a column two months ago criticizing Mr. Trump for rolling back policies to fight climate change.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s office said that he had met with Mr. Sharvit to inform him that he would pursue other candidates for the job, without specifying a reason. As the country’s domestic security agency, The Shin Bet plays a key role in the war in Gaza and Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-shin-bet-ronen-bar.html" title="">removed Mr. Bar from the post</a> last month, saying he could no longer trust him. Critics called the move an attempt by Mr. Netanyahu to purge dissenting views from the top ranks of Israel’s security establishment and the decision prompted protests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Under Mr. Bar’s direction, the Shin Bet has been involved in investigating some of Mr. Netanyahu’s aides’ ties with Qatar, including over accusations that they received payments from people connected to the Qatari government. Israel’s Supreme Court is scheduled to hear petitions against Mr. Bar’s removal by next week, and Israeli legal experts say it may reverse Mr. Netanyahu’s decision.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu’s left-wing and centrist opponents had feared that he would try to tighten his grip over the agency by appointing a close adviser. But many hailed Mr. Sharvit, who retired from the military in 2021, as an experienced and capable soldier.</p><p>There was a fierce and immediate right-wing response, however.</p><p>In 2023, Mr. Sharvit participated in demonstrations against Mr. Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul, according to Yediot Aharonot, a major Israeli newspaper. The proposals, which aimed to weaken Israel’s judiciary, prompted mass protests as many Israelis decried them as a threat to the country’s democracy. Mr. Sharvit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Tally Gotliv, a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party, denounced Mr. Sharvit as someone who had “undermined” the prime minister.</p><p>“I would not have nominated him to this important post,” she said in a video posted on social media. “Sir, think it over again.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It then emerged that Mr. Sharvit had written an opinion column in January criticizing <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/local_news/article/rjdyco1oke?utm_source=calcalist.co.il&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=Whatsapp&amp;utm_term=rjdyco1oke&amp;utm_content=Article" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s policies rolling back</a> efforts aimed at limiting pollution and strengthening the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>After leaving the military, Mr. Sharvit worked as an <a href="https://elgry.co.il/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">executive</a> in the green energy sector, and the article dealt with Mr. Trump’s climate change policy rather than any of the sensitive security issues that fall under the purview of the Shin Bet. “Trump’s shortsightedness sends a terrible message to the world of disregard for scientific reality, the well-being of humanity, and responsibility to future generations,” Mr. Sharvit wrote in Calcalist, an Israeli economic daily.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a key ally of Mr. Trump, called for Mr. Netanyahu to withdraw Mr. Sharvit’s nomination, saying that his appointment was “beyond problematic.”</p><p>“The statements made by Eli Sharvit about President Trump and his polices will create unnecessary stress at a critical time,” Mr. Graham wrote on social media on Monday. “My advice to my Israeli friends is change course and do better vetting.”</p><p>In another policy change seemingly aimed at Mr. Trump, the Israeli government announced on Tuesday that it was moving to cancel Israel’s remaining tariffs on American imports. Mr. Trump has vowed to announce an array of new tariffs this week that would affect goods across the world.</p><p>Israel and the United States have a decades-old free trade agreement that excludes most American products from tariffs. Import taxes — mostly from imported food — amounted to $11.3 million annually, according to the Israeli finance ministry.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
