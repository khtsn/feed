There are four fit specifics that determine not just the size, but a lot of other things that we’re going to get into. And two of those things, a lot of times people deem just stylistic choices. I’m going to argue that it is stylistic choice plus fit that’s going to determine how you look at all of these things in order to find your perfect-fitting jean.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/16vid-tiktok-jeans-97845-cover/16vid-tiktok-jeans-97845-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>@fashivly via TikTok</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-52"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>TikTok creators flocked to Capitol Hill last April as the app came under more scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-56"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tony Doré, chief baker at the Olympic Village, posed with his chocolate muffins, which became a hit on TikTok.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sylvie Corbet/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="VisualStackBlock-60"><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><p>transcript</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>I’m here to warn everyone that the singing is, in fact, happening, and it’s worse than you would expect. Not only were people singing like at the top of their lungs during “Defying Gravity,” but what was almost worse is people whisper singing, and their timing was off. So you would just hear little whispers of the songs, or even just some of the words before they were said.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/17/16vid-tiktok-wicked-66992-cover/16vid-tiktok-wicked-66992-cover-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>@arweirr via TikTok</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-29"><div><p>December</p><p>Users come to Luigi Mangione&#39;s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/luigi-mangione-edits" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">defense</a> after he is charged with murdering a health insurance executive.</p><h3 id="link-ba73"><span>2025</span></h3><p>January</p><p>Bad Bunny’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/arts/music/bad-bunny-album-debi-tirar-mas-fotos.html" title="">most Puerto Rican album yet</a>” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2e8nMAF/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strikes a chord</a> with abuelos and abuelas.</p><p>Lawyers for TikTok and creators argue before the Supreme Court that banning the platform would infringe on the First Amendment.</p><p>As TikTok’s future becomes uncertain, some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/business/tiktok-rednote-xiaohongshu-app.html" title="">download Red Note</a>, a video-sharing app developed in China. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-62"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Red Note, a video-sharing app based in China, began to gain some traction in the United States as a ban on TikTok loomed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Dado Ruvic/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-30"><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Madison Malone Kircher is a Times reporter covering internet culture.<span> </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
