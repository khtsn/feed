To Mr. Trump, they should be overdue payment for billions of dollars committed to Kyiv’s war effort.</p><p>Either way, Ukraine’s vast and valuable mineral resources have suddenly become a prominent component in the maneuvering over the country’s future.</p><p>Over the past week, Mr. Trump has repeatedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html" title="">pushed the idea of trading U.S. aid for Ukraine’s critical minerals</a>. He told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368624897112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a> on Monday that he wanted “the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earths,” a group of minerals crucial for many high-tech products, in exchange for American aid. Ukraine had “essentially agreed to do that,” he said.</p><p>For Ukraine, it is a hopeful sign that Mr. Trump, a longtime skeptic of American aid to Kyiv, might find a path to maintaining support that he finds palatable. But it’s still possible that the famously mercurial president will change his mind, and even his statements about a deal have been ambiguous about whether he wants Ukraine’s minerals for past or future aid — or a combination of both.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump’s proposal followed a campaign launched by Kyiv in the fall to appeal to the U.S. president’s business-oriented mind-set by discussing lucrative energy deals and emphasizing that defending Ukraine aligned with American economic interests.</p><p>The campaign included a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky and trips to the United States by Ukrainian officials to pitch deals for exploiting deposits of lithium and titanium — vital for producing technologies like electric batteries. It also involved getting backing from influential political figures like the Republican senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>The campaign was launched after politically connected U.S. investors started showing interest in Ukraine’s underground wealth in late 2023, despite the war that has been raging since 2022. A consortium including TechMet, an energy investment firm partly owned by the U.S. government, and Ronald S. Lauder, a wealthy friend of Mr. Trump, has engaged with Kyiv to bid on a Ukrainian lithium field, according to a letter to Mr. Zelensky reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>Mr. Lauder, a cosmetics heir who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/us/politics/trump-greenland.html" title="">planted the idea in Mr. Trump’s mind of buying resource-rich Greenland</a>, said through a spokesman that he had not discussed Ukrainian minerals with Mr. Trump directly, but had “raised the issue with stakeholders in the U.S. and Ukraine for many years up to the present day.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>As Mr. Trump pushes for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Kyiv’s campaign around critical minerals has underscored Mr. Zelensky’s evolving strategy for retaining American support. Moving away from the moral appeals he used with the Biden administration, he has embraced a more transactional approach closer to Mr. Trump’s style. Mr. Zelensky recently said that he would also be interested in purchasing American liquefied natural gas.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inside the Irshansk titanium mine in Ukraine’s Zhytomyr region.

He was expected in Kyiv on Wednesday, according to an official with knowledge of the trip.</p><p>The idea of leveraging Ukraine’s mineral resources took shape last summer. Kyiv was crafting its “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-victory-plan-russia.html" title="">Victory Plan</a>,” a strategy aimed at ending the war on terms favorable to Ukraine, and wanted to convince its allies to sustain their support despite rising war fatigue.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Ukrainian officials were particularly concerned about a potential return to power of Mr. Trump, who had vowed to cut off military and financial aid to Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials and lawmakers.</p><p>Their attention was drawn to an argument voiced by a Trump ally: Mr. Graham, who was making the case that Ukraine was “sitting on a gold mine” of critical minerals. “If we help Ukraine now, they could become the best business partner we’ve ever dreamed of,” he <a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last June. He reinforced his message in a <a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1832160396846776710" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> with Mr. Zelensky in September.</p><p>Ukrainian authorities say the country holds deposits of nearly <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half the 50 minerals the United States has identified as critical</a> for its economy and national security. The <a href="https://investportalua.com/critical-raw-materials/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kyiv School of Economics</a> says Ukraine holds the largest titanium reserves in Europe and a third of the continent’s lithium reserves.</p><p>Groups like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ukraines-mineral-wealth-global-markets-the-secdev-group/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SecDev</a>, a Canadian firm, have valued the reserves at several trillion dollars. But some deposits are inaccessible because they are in Russian-occupied land. And experts caution that exploiting mineral reserves could be a costly and prolonged process, with new surveys needed to accurately assess their potential.</p><p>In a November 2023 letter to Mr. Zelensky, Brian Menell, head of TechMet, sought assistance for launching a bid to exploit a state-owned lithium field in central Ukraine. The letter named Mr. Lauder, the Texas-based investment firm Privateer Capital and other U.S. and international investors as associates.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Mr. Menell and other energy executives <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/pidgotovka-ukrayinskoyi-energosistemi-do-zimi-prezident-zust-93437" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met</a> Mr. Zelensky in New York in September. It is unclear whether they discussed the bid, which has yet to be launched. “TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so,” Mr. Menell said in a statement.</p><p>Kyiv then decided to offer allies access to critical minerals as part of its Victory Plan. Mr. Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html" title="">presented the plan to Mr. Trump during a meeting in New York in late September</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ukrainian soldiers on the front line outside the eastern city of Toretsk in October.

Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and now senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, said Ukraine’s pitch was an obvious sell for Mr. Trump.</p><p>“It involves vast energy resources, economically valuable assets which are not abundant in the Western world, and it’s a way to strip other competitors, including China, of their leverage over the United States,” Mr. Herbst said. “It’s a no-brainer.”</p><p>Last fall, work was underway to finalize and sign an agreement with the Biden administration to cooperate on extracting and processing minerals. But Ukrainian authorities decided to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/world/europe/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title="">postpone the signing of the deal</a> and offer it to Mr. Trump instead so that he could claim credit for it.</p><p>A Ukrainian delegation led by Yulia Svyrydenko, the economy minister, then traveled to New York and Washington in December for meetings with U.S. officials and business representatives, with critical minerals as a central topic.</p><p>Ms. Svyrydenko outlined potential energy deals, including the acquisition of production licenses for critical minerals. A presentation, seen by The Times, emphasized that Ukraine was “capable of building the entire value chain to meet U.S. and E.U. metallic titanium demand for 25 years.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Matthew Murray, chairman of the advisory board of Velta, a Ukrainian titanium extraction company, said Ms. Svyrydenko had asked him and other U.S. business representatives for their help in making Ukraine’s case to the Trump administration.</p><p>“We spent a good deal of this meeting talking about critical raw materials,” Mr. Murray said. He added that the exploitation of these resources could become a new pillar of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An open pit at the Irshansk titanium mine.

This proposal could align with Mr. Trump’s vision, who has talked of obtaining a “guarantee” for continued American assistance.</p><p>“There are many steps yet to be taken, but the concept is very viable,” he said.</p><p>Marian Prysiazhniuk contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Constant Méheut reports on the war in Ukraine, including battlefield developments, attacks on civilian centers and how the war is affecting its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/constant-meheut">More about Constant Méheut</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>NOAA:</strong> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one of the world’s leading climate science agencies, has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/climate/noaa-trump-executive-orders.html">ordered to identify grants related to global warming and other topics</a> targeted by President Trump’s executive orders, raising fears that those grants are at risk of being canceled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Executive Power:</strong> President Trump’s early moves to slash the federal government and expand American territory represent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-ideology-power.html">significant ideological swings from his first term</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Courts:</strong> With a compliant Congress and mostly quiet streets, Trump’s opponents are turning to the judicial branch to stop some of his executive orders. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/trump-federal-courts-lawsuits.html">But can the courts keep up?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:</strong> Less than 36 hours after Trump appointed Russell Vought as the consumer bureau’s acting director, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/business/vought-cfpb-musk-trump.html">he shut its operations</a>, throwing the agency into chaos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Work Force:</strong> One thing lost in the Trump administration’s war on the federal bureaucracy is the collective voice of the employees. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/federal-workers-trump.html">But some have begun to speak out</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.A.I.D.:</strong> The collapse of the aid agency at the hands of Trump and Elon Musk is already leaving gaping holes in vital health care and other services that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/world/africa/usaid-africa-trump-musk.html">millions of Africans rely on for their survival</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
