There is another difference, too: Singapore has clung to honoring its former colonial ruler — and it wants to keep doing so.</p><p>Special accolade has gone to Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, who is considered to have founded modern Singapore in the early 1800s. For decades, Singapore’s textbooks credited Raffles with transforming the island from a “sleepy fishing village” into a thriving seaport. He has been the central character in a larger official narrative that says imperial Britain had set up Singapore for success as an independent nation.</p><p>Dedications to Raffles dot the landscape of Singapore. A business district, schools and dozens of other buildings bear his name. Two eight-foot likenesses of the man loom large in downtown Singapore.</p><p>But a new statue of Raffles, installed in a park in May, has revived a debate about the legacy of colonialism in Singapore. On one side is the broader establishment, which has held up British colonial rule positively. On the other are those who want a closer inspection of the empire that Raffles represented and the racial inequity he left behind, even as Singapore became wealthy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>This divide has surfaced before, perhaps most prominently a few years ago when Singapore celebrated the bicentennial of Raffles’s arrival on the island. Now, the new statue has set off a fresh debate, with critics pointing out that other countries have for years been taking down <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/confederate-statues-photos.html" title="">monuments</a> to historical figures associated with slavery or imperialism, or both.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>This statue of Raffles, on the banks of the Singapore River, is a replica of one that stands a few hundred feet away.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ore Huiying for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“The thing about Raffles is that, unfortunately I think, it has been delivered as a hagiography rather than just history,” said Alfian Sa’at, a playwright who wants to see the Raffles statues destroyed. “It’s so strange — the idea that one would defend colonial practice. It goes against the grain on what’s happening in many parts of the world.”</p><p>The new statue of Raffles stands next to one of his friend Nathaniel Wallich, a Danish botanist, at Fort Canning Park. Tan Kee Wee, an economist who pooled $330,000 with his siblings to commission the statues, said he wanted to commemorate the pair’s role in founding Singapore’s first botanic gardens, which were his frequent childhood haunt. He donated the sculptures in his parents’ name to the National Parks Board.</p><p>Opponents have also criticized the government for allowing the statue to go up at the park because it was the site of the tomb of precolonial Malay kings. The parks board said that it considered historical relevance in the installation of the sculptures.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Questions about the statue have even been raised in Singapore’s Parliament. In June, Desmond Lee, the minister for national development, responded to one by saying that Singapore did not glorify its colonial history. At the same time, Mr. Lee added, “We need not be afraid of the past.”</p><p>The plaque for the Raffles statue explains how Singapore’s first botanic gardens “cultivated plants of economic importance, particularly spices.” That, critics said, was a euphemism for their actual purpose: cash crops for the British Empire.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Tan Kee Wee, who donated the statues of Raffles and Nathaniel Wallich, defends the legacy of the British Empire in Singapore.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ore Huiying for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Tan defended the legacy of British colonialists in Singapore, saying they “didn’t come and kill Singaporeans.”</p><p>He added: “Singapore was treated well by the British. So why all this bitterness?”</p><p>But colonial Britain was far from benign. For instance, it treated nonwhite residents of Singapore as second-class citizens. Raffles created a town plan for Singapore that segregated people into different racial enclaves. And he did not interact with the locals, said Kwa Chong Guan, a historian.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“He was very much a corporate company man, just concerned with what he assumed to be the English East India Company’s interests,” Mr. Kwa said.</p><p>Raffles landed in Singapore in 1819 as Britain was looking to compete with the Dutch in the Malacca Strait, a crucial waterway to China. At the time, Singapore was under the sway of the kingdom of Johor in present-day Malaysia. Raffles <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/farquhar-correspondence" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exploited a succession dispute</a> in Johor to secure a treaty that allowed the East India Company to set up a trading post in Singapore.</p><p>Within a handful of years, Singapore was officially a British territory. Convict labor, largely from the Indian subcontinent, was crucial to its economic development. So, too, were Chinese immigrants, which included wealthy traders and poor laborers. </p><p>Singapore achieved self-governance in 1959, then briefly joined Malaysia before becoming an independent republic in 1965. It has since built one of the world’s most open economies and among its busiest ports, as well as a bustling regional financial hub.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The original statue of Raffles was erected in 1872 and now stands in front of the Victoria Concert Hall in Singapore.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ore Huiying for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>In recent years, the government has acknowledged, in small ways, the need to expand the narrative of Singapore’s founding beyond Raffles. Its textbooks now reflect that the island was a thriving center of regional trade for hundreds of years before Raffles arrived.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>In 2019, officials cast the commemoration of Raffles’s arrival as also a celebration of others who built Singapore. A Raffles statue was painted over as if to disappear into the backdrop. Placed next to it, though only for the duration of the event, were <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/four-more-statues-join-sir-stamford-raffles-statue-along-singapore-river" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four other sculptures</a> of early settlers, including that of Sang Nila Utama, a Malay prince who founded what was called Singapura in 1299.</p><p>To some historians and intellectuals, such gestures are merely symbolic and ignore the reckoning Singapore needs to have with its colonial past. British rule introduced racist stereotypes about nonwhites, such as that of the “<a href="https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/news-events/events/details/ips-closed-door-roundtable-discussion-on-issues-impacting-the-malay-community-in-singapore-session-five-the-singaporean-malay-identity-what-to-strengthen-or-adapt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lazy” Malay</a>, the Indigenous group in Singapore, that has had a lasting effect on <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789811212512_0001?srsltid=AfmBOoo52Rp9uvwXqzOb_BBlVDkA5HxIZy0TNdXkQNqUyr0w6NAADMo7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public attitudes</a>.

Soon after Singapore became independent, the governing People’s Action Party — which remains in power decades later — decided to officially declare Raffles the founder of Singapore. Years later, S. Rajaratnam, who was then the foreign minister, said that anointing a Malay, Chinese or Indian as its founder would have been fraught.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“So we put up an Englishman — a neutral, so there will be no dissension,” <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19690807-1.2.25" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Rajaratnam said</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dedications to Raffles, including this hotel, continue to dot the landscape of the city-state.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ore Huiying for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>The decision was also meant to indicate that Singapore remained open to the West and free markets.</p><p>In a 1983 speech, Mr. Rajaratnam acknowledged that Raffles’s attitude toward the “nonwhite races was that without British overlordship the natives would not amount to much.”</p><p>Critics of the Raffles statues also argue that his legacy should reflect his time on the island of Java. While Raffles outlawed slavery in Singapore, he allowed trading of slaves in Java, including of children as young as 13, according to Tim Hannigan, who wrote a book about Raffles.</p><p>The new statues of Raffles and Wallich were created by Andrew Lacey, a British artist. The sculptures evoke the two men as apparitions — symbolism that Mr. Lacey said represented the world’s evolution away from the West.</p><p>Mr. Lacey said he had “wrangled” with the public reaction toward his sculptures and he had no qualms if Singaporeans wanted to take them down, destroy them or replace their heads with the Malay gardeners who were instrumental in creating the botanic gardens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><p>“I was cognizant of the complexities of making any dead white male,” he said of Raffles. “I wasn’t cognizant of the degree of complexity around him.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>During the bicentennial celebrations in 2019, this statue of Raffles was painted over as if to disappear into the backdrop.
