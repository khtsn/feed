He was 94.</p><p>Suzuki Motor <a href="https://www.globalsuzuki.com/globalnews/2024/1227.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Friday that Mr. Suzuki died on Wednesday in a hospital in Shizuoka Prefecture, southwest of Tokyo. It said the cause of death was malignant lymphoma.</p><p>Mr. Suzuki served as president of Suzuki Motor from 1978 to 2000, and then off and on in other top roles with the company. His tenure of nearly half a century at the helm made him among the longest-serving leaders of any major automaker.</p><p>Under his leadership, Mr. Suzuki grew Suzuki Motor from a relatively small company with sales of a few billion dollars annually to what it is today: a leading maker of small vehicles and motorcycles with revenues of more than <a href="https://www.globalsuzuki.com/ir/bizperformance/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$30 billion</a> a year because of its strong position in overseas markets like India.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Suzuki was born in 1930 in Japan’s Gifu Prefecture, west of Tokyo. He married into the automaker’s founding family in the late 1950s, taking his wife’s family name, a not-uncommon practice among prominent Japanese families.</p><p>Mr. Suzuki steadily rose through the executive ranks until he became president two decades after he joined the company in 1958.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Suzuki with the company’s Alto vehicle in Tokyo in 2009.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Franck Robichon/European Pressphoto Agency</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>During his tenure, Mr. Suzuki navigated Suzuki Motor through alliances with major automakers, including Volkswagen and General Motors. Those ultimately fell apart, and in more recent years, Suzuki has deepened ties with Japan’s domestic leader, Toyota Motor.</p><p>Rather than take on Japan’s larger automakers directly, Mr. Suzuki focused Suzuki on producing small, low-cost vehicles. He then sought out markets overseas where demand was growing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One of his most notable successes came when Suzuki entered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/business/global/strike-adds-to-problems-at-indian-auto-factory.html" title="">India</a> in the early 1980s through a partnership with the Indian government. Suzuki’s cars took off, and today the company’s Indian subsidiary commands around 40 percent of the country’s passenger car market.</p><p>In 2000, Mr. Suzuki traded the president’s role for the more ceremonial title of chairman, but potential successors suffered ill health. He returned to day-to-day control as chief executive in 2008 after a son-in-law, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/business/worldbusiness/15ono.html" title="">Hirotaka Ono</a>, died of pancreatic cancer.</p><p>In 2016, Mr. Suzuki <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/business/international/japan-suzuki-osamu.html" title="">said</a> he would give up his position as chief executive in response to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/suzuki-fuel-economy-tests.html" title="">scandal</a> over improper fuel economy tests on cars that the company sold in Japan. Mr. Suzuki, 86 at the time, stayed on as chairman. Later that year, Toshihiro Suzuki, a son of Mr. Suzuki and a longtime executive at the company, took over as president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Suzuki met with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, in 2022 to mark Suzuki’s long history in the country.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ajit Solanki/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Osamu Suzuki stepped down as chairman of Suzuki in 2021 but continued to serve as a senior adviser.
