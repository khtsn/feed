While governments worldwide rushed to back Israel after the assault, diplomatic support faded as the Israeli campaign led to a skyrocketing death toll in Gaza.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu <a href="https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1924572771280883796?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denounced the latest criticism</a> early on Tuesday, saying the three countries had handed a “huge prize” to Hamas. He claimed they were tacitly encouraging a repeat of the Oct. 7 attacks, which saw some 1,200 killed in Israel and 250 taken hostage.</p><p>“This is a war of civilization over barbarism,” Mr. Netanyahu said on social media. “Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.”</p><p>European officials had been privately expressing “increasing frustration and even anger with Israeli actions in Gaza,” said Hugh Lovatt, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians fleeing Beit Lahia in Gaza on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Saher Alghorra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>It was not immediately what further actions Britain, France and Canada intended to take if Israel did not heed their warning. But the public statement by three major Israeli allies on Monday night was “a significant change in tone and message,” said Mr. Lovatt.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In March, Israel ended a two-month cease-fire with Hamas that would have freed the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal. Mr. Netanyahu has said Israel could not accept anything less than for Hamas to disarm and for its leaders to leave Gaza and go into exile.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu is now threatening an Israeli takeover of Gaza and the forced relocation of Palestinian civilians into designated areas. Israel has already barred humanitarian aid from Gaza for more than two months, leading the United Nations to warn of possible famine.</p><p>Critics say the pending military operation would have an even more devastating impact on Palestinian civilians. More than 53,000 people have already been killed in Israel’s military campaign against Hamas, according to Gaza health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p><p>And it is far from clear whether an even more intense Israeli assault would defeat Hamas. Israeli forces have already reduced much of Gaza to rubble, while Hamas has fought a stubborn insurgency and recruited thousands of new fighters to its ranks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The United States, Israel’s most powerful patron and staunchest supporter, has not publicly criticized the renewed Israeli offensive. But President Trump has increasingly bypassed Mr. Netanyahu, cutting a separate deal with Hamas to free the last living American hostage and skipping Israel on his trip to Middle East.</p><p>Much of the international criticism has centered around the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, a direct consequence of a two-month Israeli blockade that barred food, medicine and other essential relief from entering the Palestinian enclave.</p><p>Aid organizations <a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-update-5-7" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspended their operations</a> as food stockpiles <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-runs-out-food-stocks-gaza-border-crossings-remain-closed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dwindled</a>. Doctors reported malnutrition among children, and the United Nations <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/risk-famine-across-all-gaza-new-report-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently said</a> that people across the enclave were at risk of famine.</p><p>Over the weekend, Israel finally said it would begin allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza. But authorities let only five trucks in on Monday, barely a trickle in the face of enormous needs. Even those trucks had yet to be collected by Tuesday morning by U.N. officials, who require Israeli permission to reach the area near Gaza’s border with Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-9"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/20/world/middleeast/Israel_Palestinians_13560/Israel_Palestinians_13560-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Trucks were seen heading toward the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel on Tuesday morning after other humanitarian help had reached the territory the previous day.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Maya Alleruzzo/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>European officials met in Brussels on Tuesday, in part to discuss a Dutch request to examine whether Israel had violated its association agreement with the European Union over grave human rights violations against the Palestinians.</p><p>On Tuesday, Jean-Noël Barrot, the French foreign minister, said the European Union could ultimately decide to suspend its agreement with Israel unless the Gaza offensive were halted. That would put Israel in the same category as Syria, Liberia and Zimbabwe, among others.</p><p>“The blind violence and the humanitarian blockade by the Israeli government have made Gaza into a deathtrap,” Mr. Barrot said in a radio interview.</p><p>Nick Cumming-Bruce<!-- -->, <!-- -->Gabby Sobelman<!-- --> and <!-- -->Rawan Sheikh Ahmad<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
