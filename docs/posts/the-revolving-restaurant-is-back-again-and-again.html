Every 45 minutes, just enough time to leisurely imbibe a cocktail, the lounge makes a full rotation.</p><p>Opened in Times Square in 1985 and closed in 2020, the View is the latest in a string of rotating restaurants to make an unlikely return, this one shepherded by the restaurateur Danny Meyer and the architect David Rockwell. Gone are the outdated pleather dining chairs and gaudy carpet, replaced by blue velvet banquettes, a black marble bar and elegant Art Deco-style glass installations.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft/01FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft/01FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft/01FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="The Chrysler Building is visible through a window at the View." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft/01FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft/01FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft/01FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/02/multimedia/02FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft/01FD-revolving-restaurants1-mzft-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/bb0deacf-e35e-5eb9-b811-78e255776870" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“When else is someone going to say, ‘Would you like to do a revolving restaurant in the theater district?’ ” said the restaurateur Danny Meyer.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuvraj Khanna for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“This is one of the best views,” said Joseph Mirrone, a former New Yorker who had stopped by with his son for a post-theater coffee and dessert. “You can sit in one spot and the whole city revolves around you.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Meyer, who has his own warm childhood memories of <a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/life/vintage-ksdk/vintage-ksdkmillennium-hotel-was-the-toast-of-the-st-louis-riverfront/63-542be5e7-44da-4b63-9be3-98517c4e35bf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stouffer’s Top of the Riverfront</a>, a revolving restaurant in St. Louis, was eager to update the form. “When Marriott approached us, it felt like, OK, well, that’s something we’ve never done before,” he said. “When else is someone going to say, ‘Would you like to do a revolving restaurant in the theater district?’ ”</p><p>Revolving restaurants are widely regarded as novelties, relics of the 1960s and ’70s, when skylines surged ever higher and architects wanted to give the public a front seat to <a href="https://perkinswill.com/news/reimagining-the-observation-deck/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the rapid development</a> happening around them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The design for the rotating restaurant was patented by John Graham Jr., one of the designers of the Space Needle in Seattle.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Public Domain</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>La Ronde, a restaurant above the Ala Moana shopping center in Honolulu, was the first in the United States, opening to the public in 1961. Its architect, John Graham Jr., best known for his work on the Space Needle in Seattle, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3125189A/en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patented</a> the design. It required the construction of a wheeled turntable that could move around a stationary core, like a train on rails.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The restaurant inspired countless imitators, in cities large and small, with names that alluded to their singular party trick: the Changing Scene, in Rochester, N.Y.; the Spindletop, in Houston; the Eagle’s Nest in Indianapolis; and the Summit, in Detroit, all promised a dining experience unlike any other.</p><p>The architect John C. Portman Jr. incorporated them into a handful of the hotels he designed in Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as the $400 million Marriott Marquis.</p><p>“Revolving restaurants, like most of the other aspects of this building, are a show that has been playing out of town for a long time and has never much been missed on Broadway,” Paul Goldberger, The New York Times architecture critic, wrote in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/31/nyregion/marriott-marquis-hotel-an-edsel-in-time-sq.html" title="">a 1985 review of the hotel</a>. “But this will at least be a novelty.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-9"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Promotional photos from the View when it opened to the public in 1985.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Marriott Marquis</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Originally proposed in 1973, the Marriott Marquis and its rotating restaurant took more than a decade to complete.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Marriott Marquis</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>The review may have presaged the beginning of the end: La Ronde <a href="https://www.thetravel.com/what-to-know-about-la-ronde-restaurant-in-hawaii/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed in the 1990s</a> after its machinery failed. The Summit became too expensive to maintain, and shuttered in 2000. Skies, at the Hyatt Regency in Kansas City, Mo., went out of business in 2011 as the hotel’s guests increasingly opted to dine off site. Stouffer’s Top of the Riverfront permanently closed in 2014.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Others remain open for service but ceased spinning: Both <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/19/us/atlanta-sun-dial-death-lawsuit/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Sun Dial</a> in Atlanta and the restaurant atop <a href="https://www.dmagazine.com/food-drink/2023/04/when-reunion-towers-last-restaurant-revolved-it-caused-a-gruesome-accident/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Reunion Tower</a> in Dallas were the sites of gruesome accidents. The former Summit space in Detroit houses a new restaurant, but <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/dining/2019/11/25/high-altitude-dining-returns-top-detroits-rencen/4288442002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remains stationary</a> more than 25 years after it stopped turning.</p><p>But what goes around tends to come back around: the Polaris in Atlanta got moving again in 2022 with a sustainable, farm-to-table menu. In 2024, the Equinox, the revolving restaurant atop the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco, was put back into motion after an 18-year hiatus, using hydraulics to get it going. The San Francisco Chronicle <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/hyatt-equinox-19400639.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> last April that plans are underway to reopen it to the public as a bar called Club Revolve.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The architect John C.

Lesser for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Reviving a revolving restaurant is rarely as simple as flipping a switch. When the architecture firm <a href="https://olsonkundig.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olson Kundig</a> was hired to overhaul SkyCity, the revolving restaurant at the top of the Space Needle, “we were encouraged to go into the realm of the ridiculous,” said Alan Maskin, the design principal.</p><p>The firm enhanced the experience by replacing the entire rotating floor with glass and a metal substructure that resembles a Ferris wheel turned on its side. In 2021, SkyCity was rechristened as <a href="https://www.spaceneedle.com/lounge" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Loupe Lounge</a>, an upscale seasonal cocktail bar.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>For Mr. Meyer, the return of revolving restaurants feels part and parcel of the post-pandemic dining shift. Diners are craving “small bistros and neighborhood places, and places that turned up the dial on the experience, the kind of thing you could never get at home,” he said. “We’re doing both.”</p><p>Mr. Rockwell, who first visited the Marquis lounge in 1986, said the opportunity to work on the View was “irresistible.” After only a few years of disuse, the restaurant’s mechanics operated just fine; most of his work involved giving the restaurant its “ ‘Mad Men’-era aesthetic” while being thoughtful about the experience of dining in a moving building.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-17"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Visual landmarks throughout the restaurant and lounge help guests and servers alike navigate the space.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuvraj Khanna for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>An alcove with a piano is another visual landmark in the restaurant and lounge.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Yuvraj Khanna for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>To help diners and servers find their tables — it’s common for visitors to become slightly disoriented when they return from the restroom — the firm added visual landmarks: a dramatic spiral staircase between the lounge and the restaurant, an alcove for a live piano player and an impossible-to-miss raw bar.</p><p>“People hear ‘rotating restaurant’ and they think it’s going to be moving fast, like they’re on a carnival ride,” said Charlie Stoop, a bartender at the View. “But it’s really not like that. It’s a really slow journey.” (The lounge rotates about eight feet per minute.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>So far, the new View has been well received. Julio Montalvo, who was drinking cocktails with a friend in the lounge, used to visit the restaurant before the 2020 closing, he said, but stopped after the food and service declined. The high-end cocktails in the new edition won him over.</p><p>Lois Blank and Keesie Spector, both 83 and friends since they were 13, had also stopped by for a tipple. They last visited the View more than a decade ago, but after hearing news about the renovations, decided to return.</p><p>“It’s very nice,” Ms. Blank said. “Lovely,” Ms. Spector chimed in.</p><p>Perhaps the View, the Loupe Lounge, Polaris and others might inspire even more revolving restaurant revivals. “There’s an inherent magic in dining while the world spins around you,” said Daniel A. Nadeau, a general manager at the Marquis. “I’ll be curious to see if this sparks a little revolving renaissance.”</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times Cooking on Instagram</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/nytcooking" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nytcooking?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/nytcooking/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pinterest</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking" title=""><em>Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on Food and Dining</h2><h3>Keep tabs on dining trends, restaurant reviews and recipes.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>‘Yes, Chef,’ You Say?</strong>: The phrase has become popular in casual conversation thanks to “The Bear,” and offers a lens into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/business/yes-chef-french-brigade-system.html">shifting hierarchies in kitchens</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Is the Doggy Bag Dead?:</strong> Restaurateurs are noticing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/dining/restaurant-leftovers.html">that </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/dining/restaurant-leftovers.html">diners seem increasingly uninterested</a> in taking home leftovers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Making Eggs Count</strong>: With prices continuing to rise, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/article/how-to-cook-breakfast-less-eggs">here are five tips to stretch those precious orbs of protein</a> in the morning.</p></li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Eating in New York City</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>The End of Dimes Square?</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/dining/dimes-square.html">One denied permit for sidewalk seating</a> has raised questions about the future of the downtown destination for hip, young New Yorkers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ha’s Snack Bar</strong>: The new Manhattan restaurant has plans to scale up, but it’s already turning heads with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/dining/has-snack-bar-review.html">freewheeling takes on French and Vietnamese flavors</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>If You Have to Ask, You Aren’t Invited</strong>: In New York, members-only clubs and private restaurants have become powerhouses for socializing and networking. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/nyregion/harlem-dinner-parties-nyc-chefs-alexander-smalls.html">But there are some spaces you can’t buy your way into</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>New York’s Finest</strong>: From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html">pizza</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-bagels-nyc.html">bagels</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-nyc-sandwiches.html">sandwiches</a>, we’re searching all five boroughs for the food that defines the city.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
