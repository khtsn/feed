The authority has been invoked just three times in the past, all during times of war.

It was not until her daughter-in-law sent her images of the Venezuelan deportees in El Salvador posted on social media that she recognized him. Her heart dropped. The image showed dozens of prisoners in white T-shirts and shorts sitting cross-legged, their hands cuffed and heads down. One detainee stood out for his awkward sitting position.</p><p>Ms. Aguilera’s son had to sit like that, she said, given the damaged discs in his spine.</p><h2 id="link-12c50c1e">Disappeared</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-47"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Enrique Hernández, the bakery owner who had employed Mr. Alvarado, went to an I.C.E. office to try to find out what had happened to his employee, but got no answers.

Eight women who had been mistakenly sent were swiftly flown back.</p><p>The Salvadoran president wanted to confirm that all of the Venezuelans were actually members of Tren de Aragua.

But few <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/americas/trump-migrants-deportations.html" title="">had</a> documented public links to the gang and officials admitted that many did not have criminal records in the United States. “The lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose,” Robert L. Cerna, a top deportation official, wrote in a court filing.</p><p>To determine their gang affiliation, the Homeland Security Department had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/us-deportations-tren-de-aragua-deportation-guidance.html" title="">created a scorecard</a> in which the men were assigned points for different categories. A broad range of tattoos were worth four points. A tally of eight points was considered evidence of gang membership.</p><p>State Department officials said they provided El Salvador with the scorecard and other intelligence showing the Venezuelans were Tren de Aragua members.</p><p>Still, inside the U.S. government, some career staff had qualms about what had unfolded.</p><p>During an internal State Department briefing about issues related to Latin America, some employees were dismayed to hear that weeks earlier, American spy agencies had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/intelligence-trump-venezuelan-gang-alien-enemies.html" title="">assessed</a> that Tren de Aragua was not actually controlled by the Venezuelan government — which was the premise for invoking the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers tried to find out more about how much El Salvador was being paid to imprison the deportees, a figure that administration officials now say amounted to less than $5 million. On March 17, the State Department told the Senate Appropriations Committee that sum could grow to $15 million, but refused to provide any additional details.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-24"><div><p>Then scrutiny by the federal courts deepened, exactly the scenario the administration had been trying to avoid. The Supreme Court ruled that the Venezuelans need to have a meaningful chance to challenge their deportations, and the court is expected to weigh in further on the use of the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p>In public posts and comments to reporters, Mr. Trump has made his displeasure clear: The courts needed to get out of the way.</p><p>“We’re going to have a very dangerous country,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office, “if we’re not allowed to do what we’re entitled to do.”</p><p>For the relatives and lawyers of the imprisoned men, who have struggled to get information about them from U.S. and Salvadoran authorities, the courts are their last recourse.</p><p>Mr. Hernández, the bakery owner who had employed Mr. Alvarado, went to an ICE office to try to find out what had happened to his employee, but got no answers.
