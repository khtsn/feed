Mr. Maduro has presented no evidence that he won a July election, while his opponent Edmundo González has <a href="https://resultadosconvzla.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presented thousands</a> of publicly available vote tallies that he says indicate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-election-results.html" title="">he easily won</a> the most votes.</p><p>The United States has said that Mr. González is the president-elect of Venezuela and has urged Mr. Maduro to step aside.</p><p>The Biden administration also announced that it was extending protections for roughly 600,000 Venezuelan migrants living in the United States with temporary protected status. The measure allows those who apply to stay for an extra 18 months.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the decision to raise the bounty on Mr. Maduro was part of “a concerted message of solidarity with the Venezuelan people,” meant “to further elevate international efforts to maintain pressure on Mr. Maduro and his representatives.” </p><p>Such rewards are widely considered more symbolic than a serious effort to effect an arrest. The $25 million bounty is an increase from a $15 million reward set by the Trump administration in 2020. </p><p>But that measure did nothing to sway Mr. Maduro from taking a third six-year term. And some critics have even argued that this reward strategy has further entrenched Mr. Maduro by making it harder for him to leave power. </p><p>If he leaves the presidency, he would be extremely vulnerable to arrest.</p><p>The extension of temporary protected status for Venezuelan migrants was described by a representative of the Biden administration as an effort to support the Venezuelan people<em>. </em></p><p>The program was signed into law by George H.W. Bush to help people who could not return to their countries because of natural disaster or armed conflict. President-elect Donald J. Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/us/trump-immigrants-temporary-protected-status.html" title="">vowed to end</a> the program. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Biden representative, who gave a news briefing to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said that high levels of crime and violence — as well as<span>  </span>barriers to accessing food, medicine, health care, water, electricity and fuel — keep many people from being able to safely return.</p><p>In 2020 Mr. Maduro was indicted in the United States, accused in a decades-long narco-terrorism and international cocaine trafficking conspiracy. </p><p>The Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/venezuela-president-drug-trafficking-nicolas-maduro.html" title="">formal accusation</a> against a foreign head of state was an unusual move that signaled the United States was likely to take an increasingly hard line against Mr. Maduro. </p><p>It was at that point that the State Department announced the initial $15 million bounty. Mr. Maduro remains under indictment.</p><p>Officials from the Biden administration said on Friday that the United States would also offer $25 million for information leading to the capture of the country’s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, up from $10 million.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>And the State Department added another reward: $15 million for help with detention of Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López.</p><p>Just minutes after Mr. Maduro was sworn in on Friday for another term, the U.S. Treasury Department also said it was placing new sanctions on eight Venezuelan officials, adding to about 180 Maduro allies and other Venezuelans already under sanction.</p><p>The measures freeze assets that the officials have in the United States.</p><p>“The United States and its allies in the region have pushed Maduro to commit to a democratic transition,” Bradley T. Smith, a treasury official, said in a statement. “Instead, Maduro and his representatives have continued their violent repression in an attempt to maintain power, and have ignored the Venezuelan people’s calls from for democratic accountability.”</p><p>David E.
