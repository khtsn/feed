Mr. Maduro has presented no evidence that he won a July election, while his opponent Edmundo González has <a href="https://resultadosconvzla.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presented thousands</a> of publicly available vote tallies that he says indicate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-election-results.html" title="">he easily won</a> the most votes.</p><p>The United States has recognized Mr. González as the president-elect of Venezuela and has urged Mr. Maduro to step aside.</p><p>In 2020, under the Trump administration, the State Department offered a $15 million reward for help arresting Mr. Maduro. At the time, he was indicted in the United States, accused in a decades-long narco-terrorism and international cocaine trafficking conspiracy.

Smith, a treasury official, said in a statement. “Instead, Maduro and his representatives have continued their violent repression in an attempt to maintain power, and have ignored the Venezuelan people’s calls from for democratic accountability.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The Biden administration also announced that it would extend protections given to roughly 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States who have temporary protected status, a program that allows migrants from countries experiencing crisis to live and work legally in the United States.</p><p>Venezuelan migrants who apply can have their status extended another 18 months.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Julie Turkewitz is the Andes Bureau Chief for The Times, based in Bogotá, Colombia, covering Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-turkewitz">More about Julie Turkewitz</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Around the World With The Times</h2><h3>Our reporters across the globe take you into the field.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>A Hit Man’s Last Confession: </strong>Edgar Matobato says he killed again and again for former President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/world/asia/philippines-hit-man-confession.html">Now he’s trying to stay alive to testify</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drugs, Scams and Sin: </strong>Myanmar’s civil war has made the chaotic country a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/world/asia/myanmar-drugs-crime.html">magnet for criminal syndicates</a>, particularly from China, destabilizing law enforcement across much of Asia.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Mayor’s Odyssey: </strong>Crispín Agustín Mendoza, a former undocumented resident of California who now runs a town in the strife-torn mountains of southwest Mexico, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/world/americas/mexico-mayor-cartels-deportations.html">has become a cartel target</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Putting Wet Money to Work: </strong>At the Trevi Fountain in Rome, over a million coins are collected from the landmark yearly. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/world/europe/rome-coins-trevi-fountain-caritas.html">But who gets to spend that money?</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Transforming a Decades-Old Dance Style: </strong>On Rio de Janeiro’s fringes, partygoers have been dancing “charme” to the sounds of R&amp;B since the 1970s. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/world/americas/brazil-dance-charme.html">A new crop of dancers is reviving the scene</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div>
