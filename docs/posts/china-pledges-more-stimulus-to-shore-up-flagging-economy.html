It was the first time that China’s leaders had eased their stance on monetary policy since the aftermath of the global financial crisis 14 years ago.</p><p>Beijing has struggled this year to jump-start growth and reverse a broad decline in prices. The collapse of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/business/china-evergrande-country-garden.html" title="">real estate market</a>, where most Chinese households build their wealth, has left <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/business/china-property-mortgages.html" title="">consumers reluctant to spend</a>. Many local governments have run out of money to pay workers’ salaries, and millions of young people are unemployed.</p><p>“People do not have confidence in the economic trajectory, so they’re holding back, and the government could do more to support them,” said Andrew Polk, a co-founder of Trivium China, a research and advisory firm.</p><p>Since September, the Chinese government has rolled out a series of measures to address stagnant spending, including a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/business/china-stimulus-economy-debt.html" title="">$1.4 trillion plan</a> to bail out local governments. But Beijing has typically favored state-led growth rather than direct consumer stimulus, and many doubt that officials will substantially shift spending away from priorities like manufacturing.</p><p>China’s faltering economy faces an additional headwind in the coming year: an escalating contest with the United States over trade and control over advanced technology under Donald J. Trump’s second presidential term.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">promised to impose an additional 10 percent tariff</a> on goods imported from China. That could significantly dent China’s economic output next year, said Zhu Tian, a professor of economics at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.</p><p>Economists thought that the looming tariff threat would prompt Chinese businesses to rush to send shipments before Mr. Trump takes office. But China’s exports to the United States grew more slowly than expected in November, according to Chinese government data released this week. And some economists have warned that next year they could stop growing altogether.</p><p>“The only bright spot has been exports, which could be hit by the tariff hike,” Mr. Zhu said. “So they have to do something to stimulate domestic demand and consumption.”</p><p>A persistent decline in prices for consumer goods from food to electronics has made these challenges even more complicated, as profits have shrunk and people have grown less willing to spend. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/business/china-pinduoduo-ecommerce.html" title="">phenomenon</a>, known as deflation, indicates that China’s economy may not be growing quite as fast as the official growth figures suggest.</p><p>Beijing could attempt to blunt the impact of the tariff by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/trump-tariffs-us-china-currency.html" title="">devaluing China’s currency</a>, the renminbi, which would give exports a boost. But that risks further eroding public confidence at home, which could push people to save more and undermine spending. Mr. Xi has previously said that a strong currency was necessary for China to be a financial power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Despite falling prices and weak spending, Beijing has set a growth target of around 5 percent for 2024. It could be harder to reach a comparable level next year.</p><p>If the government sets the same target at the spring meeting, “real growth will be deviating even more from official growth,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region at the investment bank Natixis.</p><p>Beijing has been using more proactive language this year compared with last, but the steps taken so far do not add up to the change the economy needs in the long run, Ms. Garcia-Herrero said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Meaghan Tobin covers business and tech stories in Asia with a focus on China and is based in Taipei.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/meaghan-tobin">More about Meaghan Tobin</a></span></p></div><div><p>John Liu covers China and technology for The Times, focusing primarily on the interplay between politics and technology supply chains.
