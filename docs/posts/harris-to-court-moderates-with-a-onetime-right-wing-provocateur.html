    <h1>Harris to Court Moderates With a Onetime Right-Wing Provocateur</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More recently, Mr. Sykes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/opinion/sunday/charlie-sykes-on-where-the-right-went-wrong.html" title="">wrote a book</a> denouncing Trump-allied conservatives and became an explainer of the political right on MSNBC and the center-right outlet The Bulwark, which he founded in 2018 and <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/getting-off-the-daily-hamster-wheel" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">left in February</a>. In 2021, Mr. Sykes <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2021/02/09/back-in-the-news-sykes-is-no-longer-a-republican/#google_vignette" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced he was no longer a Republican</a>. This month, <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/america-votes/why-former-conservative-radio-host-charlie-sykes-says-hes-voting-for-vp-kamala-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said he would vote for Ms. Harris</a>.</p><p>“There are a lot of things that I’m embarrassed about and now regret and for which I have apologized,” Mr. Sykes said on Saturday. “I wrote a book, ‘How the Right Lost its Mind,’ and have spent more than a few years trying to atone for a lot of that.”</p><p>Mr. Sykes is set to appear with Ms. Harris at a moment when her campaign is making an explicit appeal to the same suburban voters who once made up the bulk of his listeners. The event, co-moderated by Sarah Longwell, a Republican supporter of Ms. Harris, is part of a series intended to do just that. But Ms. Harris is also trying to reach Black voters who for years were the target of Mr. Sykes’s on-air ire.</p><p>His nickname for Mrs. Obama was perhaps Mr. Sykes’s most striking remark. He said it on the air, <a href="https://x.com/SykesCharlie/status/378499283273535488" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on social media</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916070330/https:/www.620wtmj.com/blogs/charliesykes/223605631.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in online commentary</a>. In <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/10/charlie-sykes-was-a-conservative-radio-star-then-trump-won.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2017 interview with Slate</a>, Mr. Sykes said the pejorative amounted to “a brain-fart type thing.”</p><p>“That is something I am not offering any rationalization for,” he said then. “Yeah, sorry about that.”</p></div></div>
