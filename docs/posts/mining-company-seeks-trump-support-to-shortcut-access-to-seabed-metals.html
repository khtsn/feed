Its most recent annual report, <a href="https://investors.metals.co/node/10356/html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released Thursday</a>, shows it is nearly out of cash and borrowing authority, leaving it with just <a href="https://investors.metals.co/news-releases/news-release-details/tmc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$43 million in reserves</a>. “We’re moving forward with urgency,” the company said.</p><p>In January, Leticia Carvalho, a Brazilian oceanographer who is skeptical of seabed mining, became secretary general of the Seabed Authority, suggesting that the final regulations could be delayed even longer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>More than <a href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">160 nations have ratified</a> the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which created the International Seabed Authority and granted it the right to decide where and how seabed mining might take place.</p><p>But the United States has never signed the treaty. And that has prompted the Metals Company to lobby the Trump administration and members of Congress, arguing that the United States is free to move ahead with mining in international waters, since it is not a party to the treaty.</p><p>Drafts are now circulating of an executive order President Trump will be asked to sign that would direct his administration to go ahead with this plan, according to two people involved in the discussion who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the draft document.</p><p>The Trump administration has indicated it wants to secure greater access to so-called critical minerals, needed for manufacturing in the United States, even if it means making new international claims.</p><p>At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Lutnick expressed general support for seabed mining, although he did not say if the United States would defy the Seabed Authority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It is important for American national security that the key rare-earth minerals, we create ourselves,” Mr. Lutnick said at his confirmation hearing. “Fortunately we have the greatest land in the world, and under our seas is the rest of whatever we don’t have on land. We need to harvest it, we need to understand it, and we need to take care of America. We can.”</p><p>A briefing document produced by the Metals Company and obtained by The New York Times, noted that before Mr. Lutnick was commerce secretary, he was the chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial firm that was the company’s lead banker. The Metals Company also noted that its plans had “strong support from influential members of the Republican controlled Congress.”</p><p>But even the idea that the United States might be considering such a move provoked outrage from environmentalists and some nations.</p><p><a href="https://deep-sea-conservation.org/solutions/no-deep-sea-mining/momentum-for-a-moratorium/governments-and-parliamentarians/#:~:text=Moratorium%3A%20Canada%2C%20New%20Zealand%2C,%2C%20Sweden%2C%20Tuvalu%2C%20Vanuatu." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">At least 30 nations,</a> from Austria to New Zealand, have called for a delay in the start of seabed mining, arguing that not enough is known about whether it would cause widespread harm to aquatic life and the environment.</p><p>“It is a desperate but pretty dangerous act,” said Louisa Casson, an organizer from Greenpeace International, an environmental group that has been trying to block seabed mining. “This could be a negotiating tactic to try to strong-arm the Seabed Authority.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Barron pointed to extensive research funded by his company that found that seabed mining had less impact on the environment than open-pit or underground mining.</p><p>More than a dozen diplomats who represent their nations before the Seabed Authority — which is in the middle of a work session in Kingston, Jamaica — were expected to meet Friday to decide how to respond to the plans from the mining company.</p><p>“This seems a totally improper move by the Metals Company,” said Georgina Maria Guillen Grillo, a representative from Costa Rica, which has worked to slow the start of seabed mining until the environmental and financial regulations are adopted. “They have been pushing us to work on regulations when they do not seem to really care about complying with legal obligations under the international law.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Eric Lipton is a Times investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic chemicals.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-lipton">More about Eric Lipton</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/international-seabed-authority">International Seabed Authority</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/united-nations">United Nations</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Climate and the Environment</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Climate F.A.Q.:</strong> Do you have questions about climate change? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/climate-change-faq.html">We’ve got answers</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong> E.P.A.
