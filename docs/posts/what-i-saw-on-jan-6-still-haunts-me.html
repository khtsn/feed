I keep reliving the five horrific hours of that cold Wednesday afternoon, as I tried to protect elected officials, regardless of their political ideology, and their staffs inside the Capitol building — all without firing my gun.</p><p>For my efforts doing my duty as a Capitol Police sergeant, I was beaten and struck by raging rioters all over my body with multiple weapons until I was covered in my own blood. My hand, foot and shoulder were wounded. I thought I was going to die and never make it home to see my wife and young son.</p><p>Over the last four years, it’s been devastating to me to hear Donald Trump repeat his promise to pardon insurrectionists on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-vows-pardon-jan-6-defendants-day-one-2024-12-08/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the first day he’s back in office.</a> “It will be my great honor to pardon the peaceful protesters, or as I often call them, the hostages,” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-pardons-police-assaulters-jan-6_n_676d685de4b05de1fe06963c" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a> in a speech last year. But all of us who were there and anyone who watched on TV know that those who stormed the Capitol were not peaceful protesters. Pardoning them would be an outrageous mistake, one that could mean about 800 convicted criminals will be back on the street.</p><p>It could also put me in danger, as I’ve continued to testify in court and I’ve given victim statements in cases against dozens of the rioters who assaulted me and my fellow officers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>I was one of the fortunate ones that day; <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/how-many-died-as-a-result-of-capitol-riot/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nine people wound up dead</a> as a result of the rampage. Two protesters had fatal medical episodes, one rioter overdosed during the uproar and another was fatally shot by a policeman while forcing her way into the House Chamber. One of my colleagues, 42-year-old Officer Brian Sicknick, suffered two strokes after the trauma of fighting off multiple protesters who sprayed him with a chemical irritant. He didn’t survive. Four D.C. policemen harmed in the riots later died by suicide.</p><p>My friend Harry Dunn, the first law enforcement member to prominently condemn the brazen uprising, testified about our primitive hand-to-hand fighting against improvised weaponry like flagpoles, metal bike racks and projectiles, with officers bleeding, blinded and coughing from bear spray. Called racial slurs, Harry has since retired his blue uniform. My co-worker Michael Fanone was beaten, burned and electrically shocked. He suffered a heart attack, concussion and traumatic brain injury that caused him to also leave his position at the Metropolitan Police. While physically recovering, he’s been the target of constant harassment from Trump supporters and has struggled to find steady work. Steven Sund, who was the Capitol Police chief, has been scapegoated and resigned under pressure.</p><p>I required multiple surgeries, years of rehab and treatment for recurrences of the post-traumatic stress disorder I was diagnosed with in the Army. I was vilified and called “a traitor,” as Mr. Trump and some of his fellow Republicans called the riot a “day of love” and a “peaceful protest” by “warriors,” “patriots,” “political prisoners” and “mistreated hostages.”</p><p>Although I left the Capitol Police force, I remain haunted by that day. Now Mr. Trump’s promised actions could erase the justice we’ve risked everything for.</p><p>I never wanted to be a whistle-blower or a troublemaker. I grew up poor in the Dominican Republic, came to this country legally at age 12 and became the first in my family to finish high school and college. I lived in Brooklyn, just a few miles from where Mr. Trump grew up in Queens, yet the metaphoric distance between us was vast. My dad was a taxi driver who could give me only $100 to help pay for college. Mr. Trump’s father was a real estate developer who bequeathed him <a href="https://apnews.com/article/0452d29cd2564eaf97605ab90acc3a67" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least $413 million over the years</a>. While Mr. Trump escaped the Vietnam draft <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html" title="">with a medical exemption for bone spurs</a> and never served in the military, I finished my degree with the help of the G.I. Bill after I enlisted and served in the Middle East. What I experienced defending the Capitol against rioters was worse than the combat I saw in Iraq.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>What helped me was bearing witness. In the four years since the riot, about 1,561 defendants have been federally charged with Jan. 6 crimes, many of them <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/46-months-jan-6-attack-us-capitol" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serious felonies</a> ranging from unlawfully entering restricted grounds with weapons to seditious conspiracy. Approximately 590 defendants have been charged with assault on a federal officer and 169 have been charged with crimes involving serious bodily harm to a police officer, including assault using a deadly or dangerous weapon; the weapons included swords, axes, knives, Taser-like devices, baseball bats, hockey sticks and reinforced knuckle gloves. More than 300 pleaded guilty to felonies and more than 200 were found guilty at trial.</p><p>Releasing those who assaulted us from blame would be a desecration of justice. If Mr. Trump wants to heal our divided nation, he’ll let their convictions stand.</p><p>Although I don’t blame all Trump supporters — some of my own relatives support him — I do detest what MAGA extremism did to me and my team on Jan. 6. I resent the ongoing whitewashing of the barbarity and the collective amnesia of right-wing politicians who aren’t willing to hold Mr. Trump accountable. I can’t bear to hear Republicans describe themselves as the “law and order” party.</p><p>Mr. Trump is returning to the presidency at 78, while I had to leave the career I’d worked for my whole life for at 42 as a result of injuries suffered while doing my job. I sometimes wonder why I risked my life to defend our elected officials from a mob inspired by Mr. Trump, only to see him return to power stronger than ever. It’s hard to witness a rich white man get rewarded for treachery while I’m punished for fulfilling my duty. Maybe that’s why so many people don’t do the right thing — because it’s hard and it hurts.</p><p>When Mr. Trump recently proclaimed that members of the House Jan. 6 committee should go to jail, Representative Jamie Raskin responded, “In America, we jail people only for having committed criminal offenses that they are found guilty of by a unanimous jury of their peers. We don’t jail people for doing their jobs and living up to their constitutional oaths of office.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>It gave me hope when Mr. Raskin further reminded everyone that Mr. Trump was impeached for his role in inspiring a violent insurrection against the Constitution. I admire Republicans like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger who put fairness before party, despite being censured and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-say-liz-cheney-investigated-jan-6-committee-work-rcna184649" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatened</a> for their work on the committee.</p><p>At least I get to hear my son call me his hero, as we remember the people who put everything on the line to protect our democracy and continue to tell the truth about Jan. 6.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Aquilino Gonell is a former sergeant in the Capitol Police and the author, with Susan Shapiro, of “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/731243/american-shield-by-aquilino-gonell/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Shield</a>: The Immigrant Sergeant Who Defended Democracy.”</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.
