The California Coastal Ranges, stretching between Del Norte and Humboldt Counties to the north and Santa Barbara County to the south, are forecast to receive up to four inches of precipitation.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, Mount Diablo in the East Bay and Mount Hamilton in the South Bay are expected to receive dustings.</p><p>The storm is likely to be the state’s last big shot at significant amounts of rain and snow before the end of winter, when the state receives most of its annual precipitation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“In the last couple of years, we’ve had storms in April, but they tend to be less frequent,” said Mr. Hurley.</p><p>The snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, a crucial water source for the state, was <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snowapp/sweq.action" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">81 percent</a> of the historic average as of Tuesday, and any storms that arrive in March could help offset the deficit. While the northern Sierra has received an onslaught of storms that built up a big snowpack, the southern half <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/weather/california-storm-rain-snow-forecast.html" title="">has seen much less precipitation</a>.</p><p>The storm is expected to whip up winds across the state and forecasters warned of downed trees, power outages and delays at airports.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
