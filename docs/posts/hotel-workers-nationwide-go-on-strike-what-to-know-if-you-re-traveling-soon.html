More hotel workers in other cities could also soon announce strikes.</p><p>The strike comes as thousands of workers at Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott and Omni properties across the country — in about 12 cities stretching from Honolulu to Boston — have been engaged in contentious talks since at least May.</p><p>The workers, members of <a href="https://unitehere.org/who-we-are/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unite Here</a>, which represents many segments of the hospitality industry, have been pushing for higher wages and to address pandemic-era staffing and service cuts that have left some employees feeling overwhelmed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The hotel industry has rebounded from the pandemic, and room rates are at record highs,” Gwen Mills, Unite Here’s international president, said in a statement before the strike. “But hotel workers can’t afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to. Too many hotel workers have to work two or sometimes three jobs in order to make ends meet.”</p><p>The affected hotels say they plan to stay open, perhaps with modified services, but they may not always notify travelers that a strike is happening. So inquire ahead of time, or you may be surprised to find a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/your-money/should-hotels-tell-guests-strikes-picket-lines.html" title="">spirited picket line</a> in front of your hotel when you arrive.</p><p>Here’s what else you need to know.</p><h3 id="link-62e6c722"><span><strong>There’s a strike at the hotel where I have a reservation. What should I do?</strong></span></h3><p>First, call the hotel and ask to speak to a manager to confirm that a strike is taking place at that property. Unite Here has also created a website, <a href="https://www.fairhotel.org/search?location%5Blat_north_east%5D=55&amp;location%5Blng_north_east%5D=-70&amp;location%5Blat_south_west%5D=15&amp;location%5Blng_south_west%5D=-170&amp;field_labor_activity_index_target_id%5B7%5D=7&amp;field_labor_activity_index_target_id%5B8%5D=8&amp;field_labor_activity_index_target_id%5B9%5D=9&amp;field_labor_activity_index_target_id%5B11%5D=11" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FairHotel.org</a>, that offers an updated map of which properties are experiencing labor disputes. Ask the manager which services are being affected by the strike, and ask about the hotel’s cancellation policy.</p><p>Then decide if you still want to stay at the hotel.</p><p>Besides weighing the effect on services, consider your feelings about the dispute itself, said Bjorn Hanson, an adjunct professor at the New York University Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality. Some travelers like to support the business and keep their reservation at the property, Dr. Hanson said. Others prefer to support the striking workers by not crossing a picket line.</p><p>If you choose not to stay at the affected hotel, he said, you should first book new accommodations and then call your original hotel as soon as possible to cancel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In the case of past strikes, Dr. Hanson said, “Individual hotels have some discretion, but the hotel company policy was: Whatever our cancellation policy is, is the policy we will maintain during the strike. So at the very least, that is what the regular, average traveler should keep in mind and plan around,” he said.</p><p>The cancellation policy at <a href="https://help.hilton.com/s/article/What-s-the-cancellation-policy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hilton</a>, <a href="https://help.hyatt.com/en/faqs/canceling-changing-an-online-reservation.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyatt</a>, <a href="https://help.marriott.com/s/article/Article-22509" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marriott</a> and <a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/loyalty/terms-and-conditions" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Omni</a> hotels generally depends on your specific rate and dates of your stay, so you’ll need to look up your reservation on their app or website.</p><h3 id="link-2a8f2920"><span>Will my hotel stay open during the strike?</span></h3><p>In general, hotels say they are prepared to operate without disruption.</p><p>Representatives for Hyatt, Hilton and Omni all said that they had contingency plans to minimize any strikes’ impact on hotel operations. Marriott did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>While the chains would not reveal details of those plans, it is likely that they would use nonunion employees, Dr. Hanson said. They might also, for example, substitute a grab-and-go buffet for table service. And outside contractors may be hired to perform services that hotel staff would typically perform.</p><p>During the most recent major hotel strike, last summer in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/02/us/los-angeles-hotel-workers-strike.html" title="">thousands of hotel workers walked off the job</a> just as travelers were gearing up for the Fourth of July. That first strike was resolved after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/us/los-angeles-hotel-strike.html" title="">three days</a>. Sporadic walkouts at other properties throughout the summer affected <a href="https://www.hoteldive.com/news/hotel-strikes-impacting-la-events-and-meetings/688905/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">housekeeping services for some guests and caused disruptions after event organizers canceled events</a>.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
