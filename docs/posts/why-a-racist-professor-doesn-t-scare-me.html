And despite the stereotypes you might hear about the South, we all more or less got along in a region that was in rapid transition in the 1990s and 2000s.</p><p>Yet during most of that time, Cobb was a G.O.P. stronghold; it was the backyard of conservative Republican giants like Newt Gingrich and Bob Barr.</p><p>In 2015 there was only one Democrat on the county commission, a Black woman named Lisa Cupid. Late one night she was tailed by a car. Terrified, she called the police — who informed her that she was <a href="https://www.alternet.org/2015/10/one-elected-southern-politicians-struggle-reverse-entrenched-racism-and-police-state" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actually calling the police on the police</a>. The threatening vehicle was driven by an officer who later said he thought her car was being driven suspiciously. Her frightening encounter elicited no sympathy from her colleagues.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I don’t call it profiling,” a fellow commissioner said. “I call it good police work.”</p><p>Back then, the political leadership in Cobb held the blue line, even when it was clearly in the wrong.</p><p>But in the past few elections, Cobb has turned blue, with voters there picking Joe Biden and Raphael Warnock.</p><p>Ms. Cupid is no longer the dissident on the commission. She’s its chairwoman. In a place <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/this-day-georgia-history-lynching-leo-frank/KKXHU5CW7BEE5MJ2PM6UECVECE/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once nationally known for its lynchings</a>, progress is possible.</p><p>This story is one reason I don’t agree with many on the left that the University of Pennsylvania should have punished the law professor Amy Wax for what are clearly racist remarks about Black students and Asian immigrants.</p><p>The school announced last week that it would uphold sanctions against Ms. Wax, <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/09/penn-committee-upholds-sanctions-amy-wax" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspending</a> her for one year at half pay, removing her from her named chair and denying her summer pay. She will also be required to declare in her public appearances that she does not speak on behalf of the law school.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For years, Ms. Wax has been a lightning rod.</p><p>She has <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/professor-declares-black-students-rarely-graduate-in-the-top-half-of-law-school-class/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stated that</a> Black law students at Penn “rarely” graduate in the top of their class; argued for a more restrictive immigration policy <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/26/heres-amy-wax-really-said-immigration/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">because</a> “our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites”; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/us/upenn-law-professor-racism-freedom-speech.html#:~:text=Amy%20Wax,%20a%20law%20professor,%20has%20said%20publicly%20that%20%E2%80%9Con" title="">said that</a> “on average, Blacks have lower cognitive ability than whites”; allegedly told a Black student who attended both the University of Pennsylvania and Yale that she had become a double Ivy only because of affirmative action; and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/penn-law-rebukes-professor-said-us-better-fewer-asians-rcna10905" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concluded that we’d probably</a> be “better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration” because it’s not clear whether “the spirit of liberty” beats “in their breast.”</p><p>Among others, the defenders of free speech and academic freedom at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/amy-wax-academic-freedoms-canary-coal-mine" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have written eloquently that</a> “the same principles that protect her right to hold both her views and her job also protect faculty who represent a range of viewpoints around the country.”</p><p>That doesn’t mean that Ms. Wax should go unpunished if the university proves that she has engaged in persistent and targeted discrimination against students. If she had, for instance, unfairly graded minority students or decided she’d reply only to emails from white or conservative students, that would clearly be unacceptable conduct that would justify sanctions or even termination. Absent that, it’s hard to justify penalizing her.</p><p>My response to Ms. Wax’s string of offensive commentary is less fear and more an eye roll.</p><p>At 71, Ms. Wax belongs to a generation that has seen enormous social and political change, and she’s clearly uneasy with it. But the multicultural America she fears is increasingly the reality. You can go to parts of Georgia where 75 percent of the population votes for Republicans and see those Donald Trump supporters frequenting Hispanic festivals or laughing as loud as anyone at Black and Asian comedians. (One of whom is me; I do improv comedy in a very conservative county in North Georgia.)</p><p>Those of us who are part of this increasingly diverse and cosmopolitan United States would once have seen the Waxes of the world as insurmountable obstacles to our success. But in today’s America, Ms. Wax’s resentment is more pathetic than powerful. No matter what she and her kind say, I’m not going to start doubting my abilities and aspirations because of their phobias.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That isn’t to say that I shrug at every expression of racism or xenophobia. If you spend as much time on X as I do, <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1834953058054287834" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">you might have seen my back and forth</a> with the Republican vice-presidential nominee and Ohio senator, JD Vance, in which I objected to his demonization of Haitian immigrants.</p><p>The falsehoods that Mr. Vance and Mr. Trump told about Haitian immigrants were shameful and dangerous. It’s totally fair to debate the pros and cons of immigration, but bearing false witness against a group of people who survived the horrors of Haiti to come here and build a life for themselves and their families is unacceptable.</p><p>When people at the apex of our political system demonize immigrants and minorities, their words carry weight, and their policies can harmfully affect the lives of millions. We absolutely have to speak out against the demonization of the weak by the powerful.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean that utterances of bigotry by a crank academic like Ms. Wax are going to threaten me.</p><p>In fact, when I meet everyday people who express the same fears that Ms. Wax does — that their culture will be destroyed by demographic change — I feel sorry for them. It must be terrible living with this fear that your people and your way of life will be subsumed by foreign cultures that you barely understand.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The reason I feel that way is that I’ve seen the tides of progress, even the old stomping ground of the Confederacy, and I’m confident that in the long run, the Waxes of the world will lose their fight against the diversification of America.</p><p>So, Professor Wax, let me calm your mind. The spirit of liberty indeed burns very strong in my breast.</p><p>Liberty for all — even for you, despite how wrong you are.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
