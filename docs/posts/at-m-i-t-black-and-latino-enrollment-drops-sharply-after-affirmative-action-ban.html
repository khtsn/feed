    <h1>At M.I.T., Black and Latino Enrollment Drops Sharply After Affirmative Action Ban</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s incoming class of 2028 saw a precipitous drop off in the percentage of Black, Hispanic, Native American and Pacific Islander students, the university <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/profile/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> on Wednesday. It is the university’s first undergraduate class to be admitted since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year banning affirmative action.</p><p>For the incoming class of 2028, about 16 percent of students are Black, Hispanic, Native American and Pacific Islander, compared to a baseline of about 25 percent of undergraduate students in recent years, the announcement said.</p><p>The comparison to the class of 2027 was even more dramatic. The percentage of Black students enrolled dropped to 5 percent from 15 percent, and the percentage of Hispanic and Latino students dropped to 11 percent from 16 percent. White students made up 37 percent of the new class, compared to 38 percent last year.</p><p>The percentage of Asian American students in the class rose to 47 percent from 40 percent. The Supreme Court’s decision was based in part on a lawsuit against Harvard, which claimed that the university had discriminated against Asian American applicants, holding them to a higher academic standard than other racial or ethnic groups.</p></div></div>
