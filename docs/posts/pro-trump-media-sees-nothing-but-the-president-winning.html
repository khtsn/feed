scrambling to figure out their funding and Wall Street investors getting whipsawed by trade wars that seemed to begin and then end in an instant.</p><p>But through it all, the mood among those in right-wing media has been nothing short of ebullient.</p><p>“I don’t have enough time for all the winning,” Dan Bongino, a longtime Trump supporter and popular right-wing podcaster, said on his show on Tuesday. “It’s a good problem to have.”</p><p>A chorus of right-wing influencers and media figures has spent Mr. Trump’s first two weeks in office responding to his every move with a unified sense of support and even awe. The triumphant tone could reflect an important advantage for Mr. Trump during his second presidential term: In the eyes of right-wing media, he can do no wrong.</p><p>Many of these right-wing media figures have long identified as allies of Mr. Trump, eschewing traditional media practices of avoiding the appearance of political bias.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump has notched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-president-washington-dc.html" title="">several accomplishments</a> in his short time back at the White House. He has signed a flurry of executive orders intended to reshape Washington, and all his cabinet picks who faced a vote before Congress were confirmed.</p><p>But there have also been setbacks. Mr. Trump’s administration abruptly froze <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/grant-funding-freeze-nonprofits.html" title="">trillions of dollars in government funding</a> only to see two federal judges block the order. The administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/trump-federal-freeze-funding-news?smid=url-share#federal-freeze-grants" title="">rescinded</a> the plan two days later. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/judge-blocks-birthright-citizenship.html" title="">federal judge also blocked</a> an executive order that aimed to end so-called birthright citizenship.</p><p>Still, the idea of nonstop winning is being pushed by the White House itself. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a Fox News interview that “there is so much winning out of the Trump White House that the mainstream legacy media can’t keep up with it.”</p><p>It isn’t just right-wing media noting Mr. Trump’s successes. The headline of an Axios email newsletter on Tuesday highlighted “Trump’s winning streak.”</p><p>But for the throng of right-wing personalities and social media influencers who have fully aligned behind him and his agenda, Mr. Trump’s victories are absolute. Even the chaos and confusion may be a victory in itself — a sign of disruption in the nation’s capital.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Literally the only thing the left has is that Trump hasn’t managed to lower egg prices in 6 days, because he’s done nearly everything else,” Charlie Kirk, a Trump ally and head of Turning Point USA, a youth-focused conservative group, wrote on X. “That’s called winning.”</p><p>Users on social media circulated carefully curated lists of Mr. Trump’s actions since he entered the White House, mixing notable victories alongside more dubious claims.</p><p>One prominent right-wing account on X, which has more than 3.5 million followers, shared a list of 16 seeming wins. It claimed that water reservoirs in California were “filled up” based on Mr. Trump’s order, after a misleading claim that the state’s water management policy led to dry hydrants during the Los Angeles wildfires. (Mr. Trump’s administration released more than a billion gallons of water from two dams, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/trump-water-california-central-valley.html" title="">but none of it will reach Los Angeles</a>.) It also stated that funding to the U.S. Agency for International Development was “canceled.” (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/usaid-website-offline-trump-foreign-funding-freeze-9d2ecdaff5c74a9f6b0d6096fa2228ff" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">It was not</a>, though the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/usaid-musk-trump-rubio-cuts.html" title="">ordered that almost all its employees</a> be put on leave.)</p><p>Similar lists detailed accomplishments ranging from the exaggerated to the fantastical, including that Mr. Trump had “made peace” between Israel and Hamas. (A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-cease-fire-deal-talks.html" title="">cease-fire deal was struck</a> at the end of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s term with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/trump-biden-gaza-ceasefire.html" title="">Mr. Trump’s involvement</a>, though deep hostilities between Israel and Hamas remain.)</p><p>The power of the pro-Trump messaging was especially clear during Mr. Trump’s threat to install <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-tariffs" title="">25 percent tariffs</a> on Canada and Mexico. Within hours on Monday, the stock market <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/business/stocks-trump-tariffs.html" title="">had</a> dropped sharply, Canada had vowed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/02/us/trump-tariffs" title="">retaliatory tariffs</a>, and Wall Street experts <a href="https://archive.org/details/FBC_20250203_140000_Varney__Company/start/420/end/480" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flocked to television</a> to underscore that, historically, no one wins in a trade war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Before the day ended, Mr. Trump had announced a 30-day pause on the tariffs.</p><p>Whether it was a win for Mr. Trump or not seemed to rest in the eye of the beholder. Canada and Mexico both announced plans Monday that were, to some extent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/world/americas/canada-tariffs-trump-deal.html" title="">already announced</a> or were within the bounds of previous commitments. Other plans, including a new drug czar proposed for Canada, had not yet come into effect, and their impact on Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/trump-canada-mexico.html" title="">vague priorities</a> — stemming the flow of fentanyl, among others — remained unclear.</p><p>Many personalities in right-wing media saw a clearer triumph for Mr. Trump in the exchange. The “War Room” podcast called it an “utter victory” and a “truly historic day.” Tim Pool, a right-wing podcaster, said Mr. Trump had “already won” a trade war that had not yet begun. Even Ben Shapiro, the right-wing podcaster who has long criticized tariffs as costly taxes, said Mr. Trump’s plan paired with other tax cuts would be “a worthwhile trade off.”</p><p>The reliably conservative opinion page of The Wall Street Journal noticed the right-wing media’s apparent unity.</p><p>“None of this means the tariffs are some genius power play,” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-justin-trudeau-concessions-trade-border-d5bbed97?mod=hp_opin_pos_0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the editorial board wrote</a>, “as the Trump media chorus is boasting.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Stuart A.
