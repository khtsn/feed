    <h1>Bank of England Cuts Interest Rates as British Economy Weakens</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even as inflation has dropped substantially from its double digit highs just a couple of years ago, the Bank of England has been particularly cautious in easing monetary policy. Last year, it cut rates less than its counterparts in the United States, Canada and the eurozone.</p><p>British policymakers remained concerned about lingering inflationary risks, particularly as wage growth remained relatively strong, and uncertain about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/uk-budget-taxes-rachel-reeves.html" title="">impact of recent spending and tax changes by the government</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, the bank said it expected inflation to accelerate this year, peaking at 3.7 percent in the third quarter, in part because of rising energy costs. That’s nearly a full percentage point higher than the forecast three months ago. But policymakers said they didn’t expect this jump in inflation to lead to additional underlying price pressures.</p><p>In the past few weeks, central bankers in Britain and elsewhere have been grappling with the added <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/trump-economy-threats.html" title="">risk of a global trade war</a>. Although the inflationary impact of higher tariffs imposed by President Trump on various countries and subsequent retaliatory actions is hard for economists to predict in advance of those policies, they anticipate that it will be a drag on economic growth.</p><p>Britain has not been the target of threats from Mr. Trump, unlike the country’s largest trading partner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/trump-tariffs-european-union.html" title="">the European Union</a>. That could weigh on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/business/uk-economy-bank-of-england.html" title="">British economy</a>, which has already been experiencing lackluster growth.</p></div></div>
