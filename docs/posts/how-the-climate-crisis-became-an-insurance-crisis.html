State regulation, the rising cost of construction, fraud and litigation, and even changes to the global reinsurance market all play a role.</p><p>But unlike those other factors, climate change doesn’t respond quickly to policy changes, nor is it cyclical.

But the pace of those changes is hard to predict.</p></li><li><p><strong>How will state governments respond?</strong> Insurance is regulated by the states, some of which have been experimenting with new ways to halt the erosion of their markets. Those interventions tend to revolve around giving <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-lets-insurers-price-climate-173406855.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concessions to insurers</a> that stick around, including making it easier to charge higher premiums.

The money the fossil fuel companies would pay would go toward climate adaptation efforts.</p><p>The law is intended to recover costs incurred by the state, as opposed to being punitive for fossil fuel companies, said Julie Moore, the Vermont secretary of natural resources, noting that state and local governments have to prepare for climate disruption. “This is an approach to try to secure the resources necessary for that adaptation,” Moore said.</p><p>In New York State, both chambers of the Statehouse are negotiating with Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office on possible amendments to the bill, according to a spokesperson for one of the bill’s sponsors. Hochul, a Democrat, has until the end of the year to act on the legislation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>A spokesperson for the governor’s office declined to comment on the bill.</p><p><strong>The obstacles: </strong>The fossil fuel industry has yet to bring any legal challenges against Vermont over the new law, but officials and climate activists expect the sector will. “It’s a question of when, not if,” Moore said.</p><p>Neither the American Petroleum Institute nor the Vermont Petroleum Association responded to requests for comment on whether they intend to bring legal action.</p><p>Potential legal challenges aside, figuring out how the Superfund law will work is a tall order. The law calls on the state to determine which companies are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and how much they’ve each contributed. One of the biggest issues related to climate change that Vermont faces is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/us/vermont-flooding-damage-rescues.html" title="">flooding</a>, but a lot of work by scientists looking at the cost of climate change has been focused on heat, Moore said.</p><p>“As the first state out of the gate, we want to make sure we put forward the best case possible,” she said.</p><p><strong>What’s next: </strong>California, Maryland and Massachusetts have also considered climate Superfund legislation over the last few years. Lawmakers in New Jersey introduced a related bill in September.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>If other states don’t follow Vermont in enacting a climate Superfund law, some climate activists think the fossil fuel industry could have an easier time challenging the state’s policy.</p><p>A state like New York backing the idea could bring more legal firepower and resources in support of the idea, said Jamie Henn, the founder of Fossil Free Media, a climate advocacy group. <em>— Allison Prang</em></p><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-19"></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><h3 id="link-4c1687aa"><span><strong>More climate news</strong>:</span></h3><ul><li><p>President Biden on Thursday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/climate/biden-new-us-climate-target.html" title="">announced an aggressive new climate goal</a> for the United States, saying that the country should seek to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 61 percent below 2005 levels by 2035.</p></li><li><p>The Biden administration is drafting a plan to allow construction of<strong> </strong>huge data centers and electrical power plants on federally owned lands, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/19/ai-data-centers-climate-biden/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Washington Post reports</a>.</p></li><li><p>The International Energy Agency now expects coal demand to continue hitting records each year through 2027, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-18/coal-demand-to-continue-hitting-records-through-2027-iea-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reports</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p><strong>Thanks for being a subscriber.</strong></p><p>Read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/climate-fwd" title="">past editions of the newsletter here</a>.</p><p>If you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others.
