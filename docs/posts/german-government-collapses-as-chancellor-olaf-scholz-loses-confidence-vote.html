President-elect Donald J. Trump is set to take office in the United States, raising new questions over Europeans’ trade relations and military defense. The government of France — Germany’s partner in leading Europe — fell earlier this month.</p><p>And now, Europe’s largest economy will be in the hands of a caretaker government, ahead of elections early next year.</p><p>On Monday, German lawmakers voted to dissolve the existing government by a vote of 394 to 207, with 116 abstaining.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Coming just nine months before parliamentary elections had been scheduled to happen, the vote was an extraordinary moment for Germany. The elections, now expected on Feb. 23, will be only the fourth snap election in the 75 years since the modern state was founded. The moment reflects a new era of more fractious and unstable politics in a country long known for durable coalitions built on plodding consensus.</p><p>Mr. Scholz had little choice but to take the unusual step of calling for the confidence vote after his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/world/europe/germany-coalition-collapse-government.html" title="">three-party coalition</a> splintered in November, ending months of bitter internal squabbling and leaving him without a parliamentary majority to pass laws or a budget.</p><p>But the country’s political uncertainty is likely to last a month or more, with a new permanent government not forming until parties have agreed on a coalition, probably in April or May. </p><p>Seven parties will go into the campaign for Parliament with a realistic chance of gaining seats, and some on the political fringes — especially on the right — are poised for strong showings, according to polls. Mr. Scholz is widely expected to be ousted as chancellor, with polls suggesting that the conservative Christian Democrats are poised to finish first, well ahead of Mr. Scholz’s Social Democrats.</p><p>The campaign is likely to be dominated by several issues that have vexed Europe in recent years. Both Germany and France are mired in debates over how best to revive their struggling economies, bridge growing social divides, ease voter anxieties over immigration and buttress national defense.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>They and their European Union partners are looking warily toward Russia, where President Vladimir V. Putin has escalated threats about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/politics/russia-nuclear-weapons-ukraine.html" title="">the use of nuclear weapons</a> amid Moscow’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/ukraine-russia" title="">war against Ukraine</a>.</p><p>They are also fretting over their economic relationship with China, which has grown into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/business/economy/europe-economy-competitiveness.html" title="">a formidable competitor</a> for many of their most important industries but has not become the booming consumer market for European products that leaders long envisioned.</p><p>And they are bracing for the start of a new presidential term for Mr. Trump, who has threatened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-imports.html" title="">a trade war</a> and the end of the United States’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/world/europe/trump-nato-ukraine.html" title="">commitment to NATO</a>, which has guaranteed Europe’s security for 75 years.</p><p>The combination of challenges has proved politically unsettling. President Emmanuel Macron of France on Friday named his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/world/europe/france-prime-minister-government-macron.html" title="">fourth prime minister in a year</a> and is under mounting pressure to resign. Mr. Macron says he will stay in office and try to repair the deep fissures in his government over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/france-economy-government-collapse.html" title="">the 2025 budget</a>.</p><p>Mr. Scholz’s government faced similar budget challenges, along with growing concerns about how to rebuild the German military in the face of a belligerent Russia and Mr. Trump’s criticism of NATO.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The German economy has stagnated, narrowly avoiding recession this fall, and its parties will spend the campaign arguing over how best to revitalize it. Disagreements over how to balance the budget — and over whether to increase government borrowing or implement further austerity measures — helped to deepen the fissures in Mr. Scholz’s government before it split apart.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/HFOgermany-government03-bcjf/HFOgermany-government03-bcjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/HFOgermany-government03-bcjf/HFOgermany-government03-bcjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/12/multimedia/HFOgermany-government03-bcjf/HFOgermany-government03-bcjf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People gather outside at a train station near train tracks.

But as some voters are growing nervous about Russia’s threats, he prefers to point to his decision not to export the long-range missile system Taurus, which could have antagonized Mr. Putin.</p><p>Mr. Scholz, who used his address to lawmakers just before the vote on Monday as a campaign speech, said that he had promised President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine continued support, but also made clear that he remained cautious about what Germany would deliver.</p><p>“We do nothing that jeopardizes our own security,” he said in the speech, which lasted nearly half an hour. “And that is why we do not supply cruise missiles, a long-range weapon that can reach deeply into Russia.”</p><p>The strategy appears to be working. Since the end of the three-party coalition, Mr. Scholz’s personal approval ratings have risen somewhat. But his party is still <a href="https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polling at around 17 percent</a>, about half of what the conservatives are projected to win.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Scholz will have to fight hard to persuade voters to give him another chance. For now, it is Friedrich Merz, leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union party and a longtime figure on the political stage, who is widely expected to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/europe/olaf-scholz-germany-election.html" title="">the next chancellor</a>, given his party’s strong lead in polls.</p><p>Speaking to lawmakers on Wednesday, Mr. Merz accused Mr. Scholz and his government of failing on a number of fronts.</p><p>“You are leaving the country in one of the greatest economic crises in postwar history,” Mr. Merz said, addressing Mr. Scholz.</p><p>The two other mainstream parties are also led by well-known politicians who held important posts in the government: Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, whose falling out with the chancellor helped precipitate the collapse of the coalition, and Robert Habeck, the economic minister and lead candidate for the left-leaning Greens.</p><p>But in Germany’s fractious political landscape, no single party is likely to win an outright majority, and that could lead to potentially tricky negotiations to build a coalition more functional and durable than the one that failed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>All the mainstream parties have said they would refuse to team up with the far-right Alternative for Germany, parts of which are being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/world/europe/germany-afd-youth-wing-extremist.html" title="">monitored as a threat to the Constitution</a> by the domestic security services. Nonetheless, the party — which is known as the AfD and is polling at about 18 percent — appears to be gaining ground.</p><p>In closely watched <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/02/world/europe/east-germany-elections-afd.html" title="">state elections in the east of the country in September</a>, both the AfD and a newer, extreme-left party, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/world/europe/germany-politics-wagenknecht.html?searchResultPosition=2" title="">the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance</a>, had their best showings ever. But mainstream parties still consider them an anathema, which has made it hard to form governing coalitions in those states.</p><p>Those results could portend equally messy coalition haggling in Berlin after the parliamentary vote, though the political fringes are less popular nationally than they are in those eastern states.</p><p>Given the likely vote tally, many political watchers predict a return of the grand coalition of the center between the Christian Democrats and the progressive Social Democratic Party. That coalition governed Germany for 12 of the past 20 years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Ukrainian soldier in eastern Ukraine in November.
