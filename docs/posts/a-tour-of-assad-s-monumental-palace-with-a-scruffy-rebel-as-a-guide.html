    <h1>A Tour of Assad’s Monumental Palace, With a Scruffy Rebel as a Guide</h1>

Large chandeliers hang in ornate reception rooms filled with wooden Damascene furniture. Modernist sculptures remain in place in offices and sitting rooms.</p><p>But since Bashar al-Assad, who ruled Syria for more than two decades, fled the country on Sunday, the armed rebels who burst out of the country’s north and stormed days later into the capital have taken charge of this monument to a brutal reign.</p><p>They man the palace gate, keeping out looters and curious civilians. They sleep on couches in a cavernous reception hall. And they marvel at how much it must have cost to build and maintain the giant building from which Mr. al-Assad ruled for so long.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“It is wrecked now, but we want to fix it,” said a fighter with his face covered who gave only his nom de guerre, Abu Oweis. Of the palace, he said: “It is beautiful, but it was all for Bashar.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10syria-palace-add-thqm/10syria-palace-add-thqm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10syria-palace-add-thqm/10syria-palace-add-thqm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10syria-palace-add-thqm/10syria-palace-add-thqm-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10syria-palace-add-thqm/10syria-palace-add-thqm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10syria-palace-add-thqm/10syria-palace-add-thqm-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10syria-palace-add-thqm/10syria-palace-add-thqm-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/10/multimedia/10syria-palace-add-thqm/10syria-palace-add-thqm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/a77e7d67-ecea-5df4-8fdb-59d02ed30d11" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The presidential palace on Sunday, the day Mr. al-Assad fled the country.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The rebels allowed reporters from The New York Times to explore the palace, mostly accompanied by Abu Oweis, for no other apparent reason than to make clear that they controlled it.</p><p>Much of it had been looted soon after the city fell. Many of the offices were missing televisions. The floor of one giant conference room was littered with boxes that appeared to have held jewelry and fine glassware, perhaps gifts kept on hand for V.I.P. visitors.</p><p>But there was little damage to the complex itself, a sprawling cubic structure that is visible from much of the city below. On the long table in one formal dining room sat plates from the Chateau collection of Villeroy &amp; Boch, with a matching teapot adorned with the Syrian flag.</p><p>The ostentatiousness of the palace and the scruffiness of its new masters encapsulated the differences between the leader who had fallen and those who had taken his place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Mr. al-Assad, a trained ophthalmologist, inherited the presidency from his father, Hafez al-Assad, in 2000. While many of the Arab world’s dictators have emphasized their military credentials, the younger al-Assad had none to speak of. So he mostly appeared in suits, often alongside his elegant British-born wife, Asma, a former investment banker.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A defaced portrait of Mr. al-Assad inside the  presidential palace.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>By contrast, Abu Oweis, our rebel guide, had been born in Idlib in Syria’s northwest, one of the country’s poorest provinces. He was 7 when the uprising against Mr. al-Assad began in 2011 and had grown up as Mr. al-Assad’s military, backed by Russia and Iran, had used tremendous military force to try to stamp out the rebels.</p><p>Abu Oweis had dropped out of high school, he said, and joined Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist rebel group that led the assault that ousted Mr. al-Assad.</p><p>Now 20, the young rebel had never left Syria nor visited its largest cities, Aleppo and Damascus.</p><p>“It’s a big city,” he said of the Syrian capital. “Really big.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>He had little interest in the offices that occupied the palace’s upper floors. Mr. al-Assad’s regime ruled viciously, throwing opponents in prisons where many were tortured or just disappeared. The palace, by contrast, handled the bureaucratic trappings of governance, the public performance of a presidency.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abu Oweis unfurling an Iranian flag found inside the palace.

Framed photos of what appeared to be her 70th birthday party sat on a table.</p><p>A bookshelf behind her desk held a plaque showing the younger Mr. al-Assad and a framed 1983 <a href="https://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19831219,00.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cover from Time magazine</a>, which featured his father.</p><p>The text read, “Syria: Clashing With the U.S., Bidding for a Bigger Role.”</p><p>Nearby was a protocol office, in charge of organizing official visits. Its unnamed occupant had on hand a binder from <a href="https://psow.edu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Protocol School of Washington</a> and a book called “Honor and Respect,” a guide to official titles.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>A large storeroom was packed to the ceiling with gifts Mr. al-Assad had received from visitors from around the world. A cursory tour revealed plaques and busts featuring Mr. al-Assad, sometimes alongside other world leaders.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Gifts and other objects in a storeroom inside the palace.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>There was a two-foot-tall camel with a bejeweled saddle (origin unknown); a golden castle from Saudi Arabia in a large green case; and a photo of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/queen-elizabeth" title="">Queen Elizabeth II</a> of Britain and her husband, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/obituaries/prince-philip-dead.html" title="">Prince Philip</a>, dated 2002. That was long before Mr. al-Assad became an international pariah for his brutality during the war, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/world/middleeast/blasts-in-the-night-a-smell-and-a-flood-of-syrian-victims.html" title="">using poison gas</a> on his own people.</p><p>Rummaging through the loot, Abu Oweis found three paintings of Asma al-Assad, ripped one from its frame and threw it on the floor to be stepped on by anyone else who entered the room.</p><p>The palace bore some indications that the mood inside had soured as the rebels approached the city. A dumpster overflowed with shredded papers. A table in one office held a half-finished cup of coffee, a dozen cigarette butts and a remote control, evoking the image of its former occupant smoking nervously while watching the news of the rebel advance. The television had been torn from the wall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Outside the palace, a group of Syrians who had never dared to come so close before wandered around, marveling at the grandeur of the structure and the landscaped gardens around it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of Damascus could now venture closer to the presidential palace than ever before.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“He led the life of a king, and we lived like rabbits and dogs,” said Khaled Bakkar, 58.</p><p>He had attended an anti-government protest early in the 2011 uprising, he said, and was arrested, beaten and thrown into a crowded jail for two months.</p><p>“We were packed in like rocks,” he said.</p><p>He and those with him lamented how hard their lives had become during the war: the collapse of the economy, the lack of reliable electricity, the bribes they had to pay for simple government services or to get their cars through police checkpoints.</p><p>“The state didn’t provide us with anything, and when we said a single word, they arrested us,” Mr. Bakkar said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>His daughter, Batoul Bakkar, 28, was an internal medicine doctor at a government hospital and described poor wages and insufficient medical supplies, which she attributed to corruption and the effects of punishing international sanctions aimed at Mr. al-Assad’s regime.</p><p>She had followed the news of the rebels’ approach with great anticipation, she said, and now felt relieved that they had toppled the regime.</p><p>“Of course people are scared for the future, but we have faith that we will be better in the end,” she said. “We want to forget the past and build the future.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abu Oweis said he had never been to Damascus before the rebels took over.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Ben Hubbard is the Istanbul bureau chief, covering Turkey and the surrounding region.<span> </span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Syria’s Civil War: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>What Happens Next?:</strong> President Bashar al-Assad’s downfall evokes memories of the 2011 uprisings in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen, each of which brought civil war or authoritarian rule. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-revolutions-middle-east.html">Syrians hope for better</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Israel Sees an Opportunity:</strong> Israel capitalized on the power vacuum in Syria to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria.html">bomb targets across the country</a>, saying it aims to keep weapons away from extremists.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Monumental Palace:</strong> The televisions may be stripped away now, but al-Assad’s presidential residence still contains <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/assad-presidential-palace.html">many remnants of a brutal reign</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Quick Arab Pivot:</strong> Only weeks ago, Arab nations had been working hard to bring al-Assad back into the fold, assuming he was there to last. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-arab-israel.html">They were badly mistaken</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Navigating a New Syria:</strong> The Biden administration is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/us/politics/us-syria.html">scrambling to find ways to engage</a> with groups in Syria and around the Middle East as victorious militias begin shaping the nation’s future.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
