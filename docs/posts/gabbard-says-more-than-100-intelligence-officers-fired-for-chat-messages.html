    <h1>Gabbard Says More Than 100 Intelligence Officers Fired for Chat Messages</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A spokeswoman for the office <a href="https://x.com/dnispox/status/1894523661366776233?s=46&amp;t=o-czw_RlGpaSJqzNjCSS0A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on X</a> that Ms. Gabbard had sent a memo to all intelligence agencies asking them to identify all employees who had participated in “sexually explicit chat rooms” on the N.S.A. tool by Friday.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard put her actions in the larger context of her efforts to depoliticize the intelligence community and the Trump administration’s efforts to hold employees accountable.</p><p>“Today’s action, in holding these individuals accountable, is just the beginning of what we are seeing across the Trump administration,” Ms. Gabbard said. She added that officials had moved to “clean house, root out that rot and corruption, and weaponization and politicization, so we can start to rebuild that trust in these institutions.”</p><p>The Central Intelligence Agency and Ms. Gabbard’s office have moved to fire an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/us/politics/cia-firings.html" title="">undisclosed number of employees who worked on diversity issues</a> during the Biden administration. That action was paused by a federal judge who was reviewing the action and was expected to make a ruling on Thursday.</p><p>Unlike with the explicit chats, there is no allegation of wrongdoing by the officers involved in recruiting and diversity efforts, and the officers have sued the government arguing they should be offered other posts.</p></div></div>
