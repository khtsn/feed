Andrew M. Cuomo. </p><p>With little name recognition outside of New York’s political circles and an unproven ability to raise large sums of money quickly, Ms. Adams is already at a disadvantage.</p><p>But numerous Democratic leaders, including the state attorney general, Letitia James, urged Ms. Adams to run. The pressure from the group of Black women, labor and civic leaders grew as Mr. Adams’s legal and ethical troubles mounted and it became clear that Mr. Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace after a series of sexual harassment allegations, was about to enter the race.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“New Yorkers can’t afford to live here, City Hall is in chaos, and Donald Trump is corrupting our city’s independence. It’s time to stand up,” Ms. Adams said in a statement announcing her candidacy. “I never planned to run for mayor, but I’m not giving up on New York City. Our city deserves a leader that serves its people first and always, not someone focused on themselves and their own political interests.”</p><p>Ms. Adams, whose Council district covers a section of southeast Queens, will kick off her candidacy Saturday afternoon at Rochdale Village, a sprawling middle-class co-op complex in Jamaica, Queens. The choice of locale is representative of how Ms. Adams will try to build her base, hoping to target Black and Latino women.</p><p>If she were to win, Ms. Adams would make history not only as the first female mayor, but also as the first person to successfully make the transition from Council speaker — leading the city’s legislative branch — to becoming its chief executive. Her entry into the race was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/adrienne-adams-new-york-city-mayor-race-00215256" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported by Politico</a>.</p><p>As Council speaker, Ms. Adams, who is considered a moderate Democrat, has earned a reputation for being able to work with the most ideologically diverse Council in recent memory.</p><p>She will try to use that to her advantage in the ranked-choice voting system, where as many as five candidates can be listed in order of preference. Her moderate views and scandal-free record could draw voters from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Adams, while left-leaning Democrats could view her as a palatable third- or fourth-choice candidate.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In her State of the City speech on Tuesday, Ms. Adams eschewed political labels and said her “focus has always been public service, which has no political label.” She added that “policy solutions should be based on their effectiveness in improving the lives of New Yorkers.”</p><p>Ms. Adams can also position herself, as Mr. Adams frequently has, as a product of the city’s Black working class who understands their problems. Ms. James, in an earlier interview, said that part of the appeal of Ms. Adams over other moderate candidates was that she was free of scandal.</p><p>Part of her pitch for mayor is that she would not be afraid to stand up to President Trump and would defend the city from federal policies that could hurt immigrants and members of the L.G.BT.Q. community, among others.</p><p>Ms. Adams, who is not related to the mayor, is one of nine major Democratic candidates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/nyregion/nyc-mayor-candidates-2025.html" title="">to challenge Mr. Adams</a> in the June primary.</p><p>When she was chosen as speaker in 2022, Ms. Adams was considered a compromise candidate who could work with the mayor but not be beholden to him, even though they had a shared background: Ms. Adams and the mayor attended high school together in Queens.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In spite of their familiarity with one another, she quickly became one of the mayor’s strongest adversaries. She questioned Mr. Adams’s management of the budget and called his handling of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who entered the city inhumane.</p><p>Under Ms. Adams’s leadership, the City Council overrode two of the mayor’s vetoes last year — only the second time in two decades that the Council had done so.</p><p>“I’m a public servant, mother, Queens girl and I’m running for mayor,” she said. “No drama, no nonsense. Just my commitment to leading with competence and integrity.”</p><p>Ms. Adams, who often mentions that she is the first mother and grandmother to be speaker, said she was headed to retirement and more time with her family until the mayor’s legal troubles made her reconsider.</p><p>The deciding factor was when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/17/nyregion/adams-deputy-mayors-resign-trump-immigration.html" title="">four top deputy mayors announced their resignations</a> after the Justice Department moved to dismiss Mr. Adams’s five-count federal indictment. Mr. Adams was accused of offering to use his position to aid President Trump’s immigration agenda in exchange for a dismissal of his case.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The chaos surrounding his administration has caused Mr. Adams to hit a low point in his tenure. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/nyregion/eric-adams-poll-nyc-mayor.html" title="">A Quinnipiac poll</a> released on Wednesday found that only 20 percent of voters approved of the job he was doing and that more than half thought he should resign.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo was leading the Quinnipiac poll with the support of 31 percent of respondents, followed by Mr. Adams with 11 percent. Ms. Adams trailed with 4 percent, but the poll was taken last week before she entered the race, placing her above some candidates who have been running for months.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jeffery C.
