Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton blamed a lack of time.</p><p>When President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, he said, “nobody had a plan because nobody knew what was going to happen.” He added that a primary “would have been total chaos.”</p><p>Ultimately, he said, Vice President Kamala Harris wasn’t able to adequately introduce herself as a presidential candidate. “What happened was Kamala Harris was a stranger to them,” he said of voters.</p><p>The former president also discussed Biden’s decision to grant a pardon to his son, Hunter; the Israel-Hamas War; D.E.I. policies; his new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Life-After-White-House/dp/0525521445" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Citizen: My Life After the White House</a>,” and how much voters should focus on the character of politicians. Here are five highlights from the conversation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><h2 id="link-78d15ff8">On Joe Biden’s pardon of his son</h2><p>Clinton said that Biden had not handled some aspects of the decision well. “I wish he hadn’t said he wasn’t going to do it,” he said. “It does weaken his case.” But ultimately he defended the decision:</p><blockquote><p>I personally believe that the president is almost certainly right that his son received completely different treatment than he would have if he hadn’t been the president’s son.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-31a94b6b">On the Middle East</h2><p>During his time as president, Clinton worked to make peace between Israelis and Palestinians. He was the last president to visit Gaza. At the DealBook Summit, he referenced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/20/world/clinton-leaves-peace-talks-arafat-and-barak-stay.html" title="">failed peace talks</a> that he convened in 2000 with the Palestinian leader at the time, Yasir Arafat, and the then-prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak. Clinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/21/world/clinton-in-israel-chides-arafat-for-letting-peace-slip-away.html" title="">blames Arafat</a> for the deal falling apart, and he said that he tells young people today “what Arafat walked away from” and “they can’t believe it.” He added:</p><blockquote><p>I’ll go through all the stuff that was in the deal and it’s not on their radar or radar screen. They can’t even imagine that happening.</p></blockquote><p>Clinton added:</p><blockquote><p>You walk away from these once-in-a-lifetime peace opportunities, and you can’t complain 25 years later when the doors weren’t all still open and all the possibilities weren’t still there. You can’t do it.</p></blockquote><p>He grew emotional when discussing his past efforts to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <em>“</em>I’m an old guy. I have my regrets. That’s one of them.<em>”</em></p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Former President Bill Clinton at the DealBook Summit.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeenah Moon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-2fb4ba0c">On attacks of D.E.I.</h2><p>Clinton said there is “something to” the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd’s assessment that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/opinion/democrats-identity-politics.html" title="">being overly “woke” has hurt the Democratic Party</a>. But he defended D.E.I. practices, which have come under fire from the right:</p><blockquote><p>I’ve made a huge number of decisions. Therefore, I’ve made a not-insignificant number of errors. And the one thing I believe is that diverse groups make better decisions than homogenous ones.</p></blockquote><p>He added:</p><blockquote><p>I think it’s overblown, the anti-D.E.I. thing, but I think if we want to keep it and we believe in diversity, we shouldn’t wuss out about it. You don’t have to be hateful or arrogant or all that.<em> </em>You just have to say, I’m sorry, I disagree. And here’s why I disagree: One, two, three. And there’s probably plenty of room for old white guys in suits like me in any kind of rearrangement.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-8992525">On the importance of character</h2><p>President-elect Donald Trump is a felon, and he and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/politics/trump-women-metoo.html" title="">many of his cabinet appointees have faced allegations of sexual misconduct</a>. Clinton has spoken about his own moral failings. Andrew asked him how much voters should focus on the character of political leaders. Clinton said that it matters that politicians try to do what they say will when they’re running for office, and also that it “depends on how you keep score.” He added:</p><blockquote><p>Character stuff does matter. But the voters have a deep-seated suspicion of letting anybody, including the press, tell them how to define character and what matters. Because there’s no such thing as a perfect person. Nobody is running a perfect life.</p></blockquote><p>Clinton said he was friendly with the former and future president for years, and that he had continued playing golf at his course even after Trump announced he would run against Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and his wife, for president. But he said he drew the line when Trump suggested Mexican migrants were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/us/politics/donald-trumps-lousy-week-except-for-the-polling.html" title="">criminals and rapists</a>.</p><blockquote><p>I got my golf clubs and left. I didn’t think I was a better person than him. I didn’t look down on him, but I knew I couldn’t live with that because I think America is a great country in part because there’s somebody here from everywhere.</p></blockquote><h2 id="link-5630df81">On how we got to the current moment</h2><p>Clinton pointed to the financial crisis: “It was the beginning, I think, of a lot of the conflicted feelings of resentment against successful establishments in general and the finance sector in particular,” he said.</p><p><em>Watch Andrew’s conversations </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NewYorkTimesEvents/videos" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em> and catch up on all of The Times’s coverage </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/04/business/dealbook-summit-news" title=""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Thanks for reading!
