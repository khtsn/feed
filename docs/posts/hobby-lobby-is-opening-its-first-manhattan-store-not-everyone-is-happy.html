Local groups and forums that are protesting the company’s arrival in TriBeCa point to Hobby Lobby’s work with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/alliance-defending-freedom-multimillion-dollar-conservative-christian-group-attacking-lgbtq-rights" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organizations that oppose gay and transgender rights</a>.

The neighborhood, known for cobblestone streets and converted loft buildings that are now home to affluent families and A-list celebrities, is solidly Democratic, but, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/trump-nyc-voters.html" title="">like much of New York</a>, it <a href="https://projects.thecity.nyc/election-results-voter-turnout-Harris-Trump-map/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shifted to the right during the 2024 election</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.heidefasnacht.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heide Fasnacht</a>, an artist who has lived and worked in TriBeCa for five decades, said she felt “angry” about the arrival of a company that promotes the evangelical Protestant convictions of its founder.</p><p>“I moved to New York to get away from things like that,” said Ms. Fasnacht, who was calling for a boycott of the store.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“There are probably a lot of people here who do crafts, I’m sure,” says Heide Fasnacht, an artist who lives in TriBeCa.

Its owners, David and Barbara Green, are outspoken about their Christian faith, which has infused the culture of the retailer. The company has said its guiding principle is “honoring the Lord in all we do by operating the company in a manner consistent with biblical principles.” The stores remain closed on Sunday and sell Christian-themed goods.</p><p>Despite backlash from residents like Ms. Fasnacht and Ms. Lanciani, Hobby Lobby is making inroads in New York at what appears to be an opportune time: One of its main competitors, Joann, which sold fabrics and crafts supplies for over 80 years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/business/joann-stores-closing.html" title="">said in February that it was going out of business and closing all of its roughly 800 stores</a>, including 30 in New York.

They later added crafts supplies, home goods and seasonal decorations to their offerings.</p><p>Mr. Green, 83, is still Hobby Lobby’s chief executive. <a href="https://newsroom.hobbylobby.com/executive-team/steve-green" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One of his sons is president</a> of the retailer, and another started an affiliate <a href="https://www.mardel.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">company that sells Christian books and church supplies</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Today, Hobby Lobby stores are as big as 90,000 square feet and filled with tens of thousands of items.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-19"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>At Hobby Lobby’s Staten Island location, shoppers can browse a wide selection of crosses. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Oliver Farshi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The retailer’s Christian principles may seem like an odd fit for Manhattan, let alone TriBeCa.
