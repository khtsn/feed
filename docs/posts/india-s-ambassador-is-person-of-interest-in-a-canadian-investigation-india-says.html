A spokeswoman for the Canadian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>The two countries have been in an intense dispute following the assassination of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/world/canada/canada-india-sikh-killing.html" title="">Canadian Sikh cleric in </a>British Columbia in June 2023, which the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at the time had been orchestrated by the Indian government. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Canada is home to a large Sikh community and India has said that some Sikhs in Canada are actively involved in a secessionist movement that seeks to carve out a Sikh homeland. </p><p>The Indian government has vehemently denied the accusations that it was involved in the killing of the cleric and has claimed that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada is pandering to Canada’s large Sikh community for political gain.</p><p>On Monday the Indian government summoned Canada’s second-highest ranking diplomat, Stewart Wheeler, the chargé d’affaires, to explain his government’s actions in a meeting at the Indian foreign ministry. </p><p>Several news outlets in India said that as he left Mr. Wheeler told local news media at the foreign ministry that the Canadian government had “provided credible irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.”</p><p>He added that Indian should “live up to what it said it would do and look into our allegations. It is in the interest of both our countries and the peoples of our countries to get to the bottom of this. Canada stands ready to cooperate with India.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, a prominent Sikh leader and president of a Sikh temple in Surrey, was killed outside the temple last year.
