In death he made sure to project the same quality.</p><p>The signs of this down-to-earth approach to the papacy were immediate, starting with taking the name of the saint known for his ministry of the poor. His first public remarks, addressed to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square after his election in 2013, ended with a simple, “Good night and rest well.” Then came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/world/europe/pope-francis.html" title="">touches</a> like the ordinary black shoes instead of elegant loafers, paying his own lodging bill from the conclave, waving Vatican staff members into an elevator with him on his first day as pope and moving into a nondescript Vatican residence instead of the Apostolic Palace.</p><p>Francis, who died at 88 on Monday, adopted the same humble tone for his departure from this world. Last year he <a href="https://www.ncregister.com/news/what-do-the-revisions-to-the-papal-funeral-rites-signify" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simplified</a> the elaborate funeral rites developed over centuries of tradition, a permeating characteristic of the Catholic Church. The changes came in a new edition of the rule book for papal funerals, the “Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis.”</p><p>It was in keeping with Francis’ effort throughout his papacy to inject a sense of simplicity into the image of the church hierarchy, a pastoralism that most popes at least give lip service to but this one has taken concrete steps to carry out.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>To start, the Vatican camerlengo — or the official in charge of the time between the death or resignation of a pope and the election of his successor — was required to confirm the pope’s death in a private chapel, instead of the room where he dies. (Doctors will be on the job, too.) He still presumably did so by calling out the name the pontiff was given at birth — Mario Bergoglio — since in death, the man no longer held the office. During the funeral, ordinary words like “pope,” “bishop” and “pastor” will be used instead of the pope’s more ornate titles, which include Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles and Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church.</p><p>His body will go into a zinc-lined, wooden coffin instead of the triplicate coffins of the past (cypress, lead and oak). It will bypass the private viewing for church officials in the Apostolic Palace and go straight to St. Peter’s Basilica for viewing by the public. The coffin will not be placed on a catafalque, or raised bier.</p><p>Of course, the funeral — followed by nine days of masses — will still have the magnitude of a monarchical farewell, filled with centuries-old ritual. It will attract world leaders, a vast multitude of mourners in and around St. Peter’s Square and the attention of the global media. Yet Francis wanted to convey that his funeral “was that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not a powerful man of this world,” Archbishop Diego Ravelli, the man in charge of papal liturgical celebrations, has said in <a href="https://www.exaudi.org/new-edition-of-the-liturgical-book-for-the-popes-funeral/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> interviews.</p><p>The new rules also allow for popes to be buried outside of St. Peter’s, although popes from centuries past have been entombed elsewhere under previous custom. Francis said he wanted his resting place to be the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, or St. Mary Major, one of his preferred places to pray. He will join several other popes there.</p><p>Francis <a href="https://aleteia.org/2024/05/15/pope-francis-future-tomb-at-the-feet-of-the-virgin-mary" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even identified</a> the spot: a small room, behind a nondescript wooden door, that once stored candelabras.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Daniel J.
