The compromised service had been taken offline, and there is no evidence that the Chinese state actor still has access to Treasury information, the department said.</p><p>In a statement, a Treasury spokesman said that the department took threats against its systems and the data they hold very seriously, and that it would continue to work with the private sector and government agencies to protect the financial system from hacking.</p><p>The Treasury Department did not clarify when the episode took place but said it would reveal more details in a forthcoming report to Congress.</p><p>Chinese officials have long denied any government role in hacking, and have set up dialogues with the United States to work together on cybersecurity.
