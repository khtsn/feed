They are also rushing to fill huge holes in collective research caused by the cuts, particularly in areas targeted by the Trump administration, including studies of climate change, public health, environmental science, gender and diversity.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>If the movement becomes a trend, it could mean the reversal of the long-term brain drain that has seen generations of scientists move to the United States. And while at least some Europeans have noted that the changes in the United States provide a unique opportunity to build stronger European research centers, most academics say that competition is not the short-term motivation.</p><p>“This program is ultimately linked to indignation, to declare what is happening in the United States is not normal,” said Éric Berton, president of Aix Marseille University, which has earmarked 15 million euros (nearly $16,300,000) for 15 three-year positions.</p><p>He said the number of openings “wasn’t much,” but the goal was to “give them a little hope.”</p><p>In France, Aix Marseille University is considered a leader in the push to bring in American researchers.</p><p>Since that program started, a cancer research foundation in Paris <a href="https://www.fondation-arc.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/CP_ARC_chercheursUS.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it was immediately putting up 3.5 million euros to welcome American cancer researchers. And last week, two universities in Paris announced they were offering positions to American scientists whose work has been curtailed or halted by the Trump administration.</p><p>“We are researchers. We want to continue to work at the highest level in these fields that are being attacked in the United States,” explained El Mouhoub Mouhoud, the president of Université Paris Sciences et Lettres.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The university plans to welcome 15 researchers who are already working on shared projects in targeted areas including climate science, health, humanities and gender studies, said Mr. Mouhoud. As a result, the projects would continue unfettered and the American researchers could enjoy “academic freedom to do their research,” he said.</p><p>“That’s good for everyone,” Mr. Mouhoud said.</p><p>The alarms at European scientific institutions began sounding as the Trump administration started slashing jobs and freezing science grants as part of its broad cost-cutting measures.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“We could lose a generation of science, a generation of scientists, something that we cannot recover from,” said Yasmine Belkaid, president of the Pasteur Institute in Paris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mike Lawrence/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Firings at U.S. centers deemed the pinnacle of science have been announced week after week including at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/climate/noaa-trump-staff-cuts.html" title="">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/climate/trump-nsf-cuts-antarctica.html" title="">National Science Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/national-science-foundation-firings.html" title="">U.S. Geological Survey</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/fda-cdc-health-department-trump.html" title="">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a></p><p>The National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, fired 1,200 employees and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/science/nih-research-funding-delays.html" title="">put grant reviews on hold</a>, essentially turning off the tap of government funding for research projects in labs across the country.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The cuts come as some federal agencies have removed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html" title="">terms from websites and grant applications that are deemed unacceptable to the Trump administration</a>, which is seeking to purge the federal government of “woke” initiatives.

It’s incalculable.”</p><p>Speaking of scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with whom he worked closely in his past job, Mr. Baptiste said: “These people are of exceptional scientific quality, dealing with weather, climate and earth observation. And what’s the idea? To say that we can no longer work on these issues?”</p><p>Mr. Baptiste has been working with the presidents of French universities to come up with a government program.

While he did not mention Mr. Trump directly, he hinted at it in a letter to the Dutch House of Representatives. “The geopolitical climate is changing, which is currently increasing the international mobility of scientists,” he wrote. “Several European countries are responding to this and are going to attract international scientific talent. I want the Netherlands to continue to be at the forefront.”</p><p>Ulrike Malmendier, a German economist who is member of Germany’s leading economic council, urged European governments to increase investment in science to attract out-of-work researchers from the United States. “The development in the U.S.A. is a huge opportunity for Germany and Europe,” Ms. Malmendier, who is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told Germany’s <a href="https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.wissenschaft-wirtschaftsweise-empfiehlt-anwerbung-von-us-spitzenforschern.961ce24a-4812-4e0e-8584-49c864a4ded4.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Funke media group</a>. “I know that a lot of people are thinking about leaving,”</p><p>Reporting was contributed by <!-- -->Jeanna Smialek<!-- --> from Brussels, <!-- -->Claire Moses<!-- --> from London, and <!-- -->Christopher F.
