LONG LIVE THE KING!”</p><p>Referring to himself as a king “is the thing presidents are not supposed to do,” Stephen Colbert said on Thursday.</p><blockquote><p>“Yes, the classic domain of an all-powerful king. Yes, it’s what all kings do: regulate local toll roads. <em>[imitating a king]</em> <em>‘</em>Behold!

But with this guy, every troll is a trial balloon. So, here we go. Mr. Trump, America will never bow before any king not named ‘Burger,’ for he hath made us all part of the royal family.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><p>Colbert remarked that even though Trump has been “busy cosplaying as the czar of the Lincoln Tunnel,” congestion pricing has significantly reduced traffic and increased support for Broadway shows and local businesses.</p><blockquote><p>“Now, obviously, this seems like a good thing, so Donald Trump ruined it.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Governor Hochul immediately said congestion pricing wouldn’t end, posting, ‘The cameras are staying on.’ Governor, I love your defiance, but you know Trump loves cameras. This just means he’s going to do his next press conference strapped to the hood of a Camry.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-237778d1">The Punchiest Punchlines (DOGE Dollars Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“DOGE-head Elon Musk says he’s considering giving 78 million Americans $5,000 per household.

It’ll be more popular than that mall tour I did with Menudo.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p><p>“Perhaps it’s not exactly right. ‘Right’ would be all the cuts go to preventing a full default on the debt; otherwise, we’ll face an economic crisis that would make the Depression look like a trip to Sandals with Trace Gallagher.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Taylor Tomlinson explored the social media trend of mostly shirtless men doing meal prep on Thursday’s “After Midnight.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Kenturah Davis, an artist in Altadena, is continuing the legacy of her parents, Keni Arts and Mildred Davis, who are also artists in Altadena, a community in Los Angeles County.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Phylicia J.L.
