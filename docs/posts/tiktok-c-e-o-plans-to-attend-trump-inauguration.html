Trump’s inauguration and has been invited to sit in a position of honor on the dais, where former presidents, family members and other important guests traditionally are seated, two people familiar with the plans said Wednesday.</p><p>The invitation to the executive, Shou Chew, went out from the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Monday’s inauguration. Mr. Chew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/dealbook/zuckerberg-bezos-trump-inauguration.html" title="">will join</a> tech moguls like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk at the event; Jeff Bezos has also been invited.</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s support for TikTok ​marks ​a stunning reversal from 2020, when he tried during his first term to block the app in the United States and force its sale to American companies​. He warmed up to the company last year, particularly after he and his campaign surged in popularity on TikTok during last year’s election.</p><p>The Trump administration’s embrace of Mr. Chew is significant as the app teeters on the brink of death in the United States. Congress passed a law last year saying that ByteDance had to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States as of Jan. 19, citing national security concerns. TikTok has been gambling for the better part of a year that it can defeat the law in courts. More recently, it has set its sights on aiming to reach <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html" title="">another solution</a> with the Trump administration to avoid an outright sale. The Supreme Court is set to rule on the law in the coming days.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Trump has vowed to save the app in the United States once he is inaugurated on Jan. 20, though his options for doing so are limited. Legal experts have said that the area where Mr. Trump could most likely intervene would involve a part of the law that gives the president the authority to determine whether ByteDance has done enough to remove TikTok from Chinese control.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
