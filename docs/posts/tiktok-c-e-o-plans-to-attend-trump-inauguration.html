Trump’s inauguration and has been invited to sit in a position of honor on the dais, where former presidents, family members and other important guests traditionally are seated, two people familiar with the plans said on Wednesday.</p><p>The invitation to the executive, Shou Chew, went out from the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the inauguration on Monday. Mr. Chew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/dealbook/zuckerberg-bezos-trump-inauguration.html" title="">will join</a> Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk on the dais, along with other tech executives at the event, according to two people with knowledge of the planning.</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s support for TikTok ​marks ​a stunning reversal from 2020, when he tried during his first term to block the app in the United States and force its sale to American companies​. He warmed up to the company last year, particularly after he and his campaign surged in popularity on TikTok during last year’s election.</p><p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly talked about how content about him and his campaign has performed well on TikTok. His advisers saw value in engaging with the site and have said it helped him reach younger voters and those who tuned out mainstream media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Trump administration’s embrace of Mr. Chew is significant as the app teeters on the brink of death in the United States. Congress passed a law last year saying that ByteDance had to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States as of Jan. 19, citing national security concerns. TikTok has been gambling for the better part of a year that it can defeat the law in courts. More recently, it has set its sights on aiming to reach <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html" title="">another solution</a> with the Trump administration to avoid an outright sale. The Supreme Court is set to rule on the law in the coming days.</p><p>Mr. Trump has vowed to save the app in the United States once he is inaugurated on Jan. 20, though his options for doing so are limited. Legal experts have said that the area where Mr. Trump could most likely intervene would involve a part of the law that gives the president the authority to determine whether ByteDance has done enough to remove TikTok from Chinese control.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html" title="">publicly ​c​hanged</a> his stance on TikTok last year, soon after he met with Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor who owns a significant share of ByteDance.​ Mr. Trump has said they did not discuss the company. But Mr. Yass helped found the trading firm Susquehanna International Group and ​is one of the biggest supporters of the anti-tax lobbying group Club for Growth​.​ It has hired people with ties to Mr. Trump, such as Kellyanne Conway, a former top adviser to the incoming president, and the Republican adviser David Urban, to lobby for TikTok in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/16/us/trump-news/49c221c5-1f45-5afc-8c76-3642023a28a5?smid=url-share" title="">met with TikTok executives</a> on Dec. 16 at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, according to an official familiar with the matter. Around the time of that meeting, TikTok officials told people in Mr. Trump’s orbit, and possibly the president-elect himself, that Mr. Trump should be the one to decide TikTok’s fate, according to two people with knowledge of the contacts between the two sides, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had a “warm spot” for TikTok and that he would look into the issue.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Maggie Haberman is a senior political correspondent reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races across the country and the investigations into former President Donald J.
