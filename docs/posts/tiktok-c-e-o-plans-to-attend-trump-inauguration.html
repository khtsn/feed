    <h1>TikTok C.E.O. Plans to Attend Trump Inauguration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Trump administration’s embrace of Mr. Chew is significant as the app teeters on the brink of death in the United States. Congress passed a law last year saying that ByteDance had to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States as of Jan. 19, citing national security concerns. TikTok has been gambling for the better part of a year that it can defeat the law in courts. More recently, it has set its sights on aiming to reach <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html" title="">another solution</a> with the Trump administration to avoid an outright sale. The Supreme Court is set to rule on the law in the coming days.</p><p>Mr. Trump has vowed to save the app in the United States once he is inaugurated on Jan. 20, though his options for doing so are limited. Legal experts have said that the area where Mr. Trump could most likely intervene would involve a part of the law that gives the president the authority to determine whether ByteDance has done enough to remove TikTok from Chinese control.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html" title="">publicly ​c​hanged</a> his stance on TikTok last year, soon after he met with Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor who owns a significant share of ByteDance.​ Mr. Trump has said they did not discuss the company. But Mr. Yass helped found the trading firm Susquehanna International Group and ​is one of the biggest supporters of the anti-tax lobbying group Club for Growth​.​ It has hired people with ties to Mr. Trump, such as Kellyanne Conway, a former top adviser to the incoming president, and the Republican adviser David Urban, to lobby for TikTok in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/16/us/trump-news/49c221c5-1f45-5afc-8c76-3642023a28a5?smid=url-share" title="">met with TikTok executives</a> on Dec. 16 at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, according to an official familiar with the matter. Around the time of that meeting, TikTok officials told people in Mr. Trump’s orbit, and possibly the president-elect himself, that Mr. Trump should be the one to decide TikTok’s fate, according to two people with knowledge of the contacts between the two sides, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had a “warm spot” for TikTok and that he would look into the issue.</p></div></div>
