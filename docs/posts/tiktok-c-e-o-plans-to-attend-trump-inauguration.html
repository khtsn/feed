    <h1>TikTok C.E.O. Plans to Attend Trump Inauguration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/technology/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew.html" title="">chief executive of TikTok</a> plans to attend President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration and has been invited to sit in a position of honor on the dais, where former presidents, family members and other important guests traditionally are seated, two people familiar with the plans said Wednesday.</p><p>The invitation to the executive, Shou Chew, went out from the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Monday’s inauguration. Mr. Chew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/business/dealbook/zuckerberg-bezos-trump-inauguration.html" title="">will join</a> tech moguls like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk at the event; Jeff Bezos has also been invited.</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s support for TikTok ​marks ​a stunning reversal from 2020, when he tried during his first term to block the app in the United States and force its sale to American companies​. He warmed up to the company last year, particularly after he and his campaign surged in popularity on TikTok during last year’s election.</p><p>The Trump administration’s embrace of Mr. Chew is significant as the app teeters on the brink of death in the United States. Congress passed a law last year saying that ByteDance had to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States as of Jan. 19, citing national security concerns. TikTok has been gambling for the better part of a year that it can defeat the law in courts. More recently, it has set its sights on aiming to reach <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/us/politics/trump-tik-tok-ban.html" title="">another solution</a> with the Trump administration to avoid an outright sale. The Supreme Court is set to rule on the law in the coming days.</p></div></div>
