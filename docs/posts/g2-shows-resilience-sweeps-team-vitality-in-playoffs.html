</span>, losing a round where they read their opponents perfectly due to a <span data-ref-id="3">

		Less	</a>
</span> 1v2 clutch. Vitality even converted the bonus round to get a quick 3-0 lead, but G2 won a crucial thrifty to stop the bleeding. G2 was able to tie the game up after a slow start thanks to <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15500/trent">

</span>, finding three kills to allow for a defuse from <span data-ref-id="5">

</span>.</p>


<p><em>trent finds an important triple kill to tie the game early on in Bind.</em></p>

<p>G2 tried to force solo fights against the default-focused attack from Vitality, using combos with the Tejo missiles as the focus. That couldn&#39;t stop the pure firepower from <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/5022/derke">
		Derke	</a>
</span>, as he highlighted his attack half with an ace, and Vitality ended the half with a 7-5 lead. </p>

<p>Despite another advantageous read and player advantage, G2 lost their second pistol of the series and their eighth straight, and a force afterward didn&#39;t work out. However, that 10-5 lead started to wane after some smart G2 post-plants. Derke seemed to stop any chance of a comeback as he led Vitality to a 12-8 lead, but <span data-ref-id="7">

</span> and <span data-ref-id="8">

</span> pulled G2 to overtime. It was a tense first two rounds of OT, but the two afterward were one-sided as G2 completed the comeback and won 15-13. G2 completed the map win despite losing both pistol and bonus rounds.</p>

<p>Next up was Lotus, with G2 running the Breach/Tejo composition while Vitality ran their Viper, Vyse, and Fade composition. G2 then ended their pistol loss streak and converted their bonus to get an early lead on their attack half. Of all the shooters across both teams, <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4581/jonahp">
		JonahP	</a>
</span> was the star at the start of Lotus.</p>


<p><em>JonahP secures a close 1v2 scenario against Team Vitality.</em></p>

<p>It took two Sherriff thrifty rounds from Less and <span data-ref-id="10">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/312/sayf">
		Sayf	</a>
</span> to bring Vitality back, and that inspired the rest of Vitality to heat up as the half came to an end, ending tied 6-6 after going down 6-1.</p>

<p>G2 was able to win the second pistol round with a B site retake and converted the bonus round to go up 10-6. Vitality showed some hope with some post-plants on C site, but G2 was able to close out the map 13-9 and deliver Team Vitality their first loss in VCT 2025. </p>

<p>Across the series, it was leaf who stood out as the best player across both teams, ending with a match rating of 1.53, 84% KAST, and 194 ADR. </p>

<p>With this win, <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/449010/edward-gaming-vs-g2-esports-champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok-ubf" target="_blank">G2 Esports will rematch against EDward Gaming</a> in the upper final of Masters Bangkok. <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/449012/t1-vs-team-vitality-champions-tour-2025-masters-bangkok-lr1" target="_blank">Team Vitality will face T1 in the lower bracket semifinal</a> to see who can keep their run alive.</p>
