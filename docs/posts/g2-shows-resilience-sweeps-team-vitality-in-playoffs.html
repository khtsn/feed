name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>President Trump will host President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House on Friday to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-deal.html" title="">seal an agreement</a> handing over rare mineral rights to the United States even as the new American administration pursues a separate deal to end Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>While Mr. Trump has hosted several world leaders in the month since he took office again, no meeting has been as charged as the one with Mr. Zelensky promises to be. Just last week, Mr. Trump falsely asserted that Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-zelensky-ukraine-comments.html" title="">“started”</a> the war with Russia and called Mr. Zelensky a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-zelensky-trump-russia-war.html" title="">“dictator without elections.”</a></p><p>In fact, it was Russia that started the war in 2014 and mounted a full-scale invasion in 2022. Although Ukrainian elections have been suspended for the past three years under martial law, Mr. Zelensky became president on the back of a landslide election victory in 2019. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, by contrast, is an actual dictator whose elections have been widely dismissed as frauds and who faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes.</p><p>Mr. Trump sought to smooth over the rift with Mr. Zelensky on Thursday before their meeting at the White House, brushing off a question about whether he still considers the Ukrainian leader a dictator.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Did I say that?” Mr. Trump asked. “I can’t believe I said that. Next question.”</p><p>At a later news conference with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, Mr. Trump did not respond to a question about whether he owed Mr. Zelensky an apology for calling him a dictator. “We’re going to have a very good meeting,” he said. “I have a lot of respect for him.”</p><p>His sharp language last week about Mr. Zelensky contrasted with his assessment of Mr. Putin, whom he has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/trump-russia-putin.html" title="">only praised</a> since winning a second term. Just this week, the president called Mr. Putin “a very smart guy” and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/02/remarks-by-president-trump-before-cabinet-meeting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“a very cunning person.”</a> He said that he believes that Mr. Putin really wants peace and added on Thursday that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/27/us/trump-news/starmer-ukraine-trump?smid=url-share" title="">“he’ll keep his word”</a> if a deal is reached, despite multiple Russian violations of agreements in the past.</p><p>While he has spoken with Mr. Putin by telephone, Mr. Trump has given little sense of how he expects to negotiate either a cease-fire or an enduring peace agreement. During last year’s campaign, he promised to end the war within 24 hours and to do so even before his inauguration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/us/politics/trump-promise-ending-ukraine-war.html" title="">neither of which he actually did</a>.</p><p>During Thursday’s news conference, Mr. Trump expressed a mix of optimism and fatalism about his chances of making peace. “I think it’s going to happen, hopefully quickly,” he said. “If it doesn’t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.”</p><p>Mr. Starmer and other European leaders have offered to contribute troops to a multinational peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine after the fighting halts. But Mr. Trump resisted pressure to commit U.S. forces to help, even without ground troops, or to offer security guarantees to Ukraine against renewed Russian aggression.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Since taking office, Mr. Trump has demanded that Ukraine turn over some of its natural resources as payback for military aid provided under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to defend itself against Russia. While Mr. Trump has falsely claimed that the United States has contributed $350 billion and Europe only $100 billion, in fact, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Europe has allocated $138 billion compared with $119 billion from the United States.</p><p>Under a draft of the rare minerals agreement reviewed by The New York Times, Ukraine would contribute half of its revenues from the future monetization of natural resources, including critical minerals, oil and gas. Mr. Trump characterized the deal on Thursday as an economic development boon. “It’ll be good for both countries,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times.
