Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-likely-give-tiktok-90-day-extension-avoid-ban-rcna188258" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NBC News</a> that he would “most likely” find a way to give the company a 90-day extension once he takes office on Monday “because it’s appropriate.”</p><p>Earlier on Saturday, the White House press secretary called TikTok’s claim it would go dark “a stunt.” TikTok, in a statement late Friday, had called on the Biden administration to assure Apple, Google and other technology companies that they would not be punished for delivering TikTok’s services in the United States.</p><p>“We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Despite the back and forth, TikTok’s fate was still unclear.</p><p>The company’s statement was its latest attempt to pressure the administration to grant it a reprieve from a law, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/supreme-court-tiktok.html" title="">upheld by the Supreme Court</a> on Friday, that would effectively ban its service starting Sunday.</p><p>The law says that app stores and major cloud computing providers cannot deliver TikTok to U.S. consumers unless the company is sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to a non-Chinese owner. Lawmakers introduced the measure last year over fears that TikTok’s Chinese ownership poses a threat to national security.</p><p>TikTok did not detail what would happen on Sunday, including whether it would voluntarily shut itself down or simply cease to function because it would lose access to services it needs to stay online. The app claims 170 million U.S. users.</p><p>The Biden administration had earlier signaled that federal officials would not immediately take action against Apple, Google and the other companies under the law.</p><p>President Biden signed the TikTok ban bill into law in April after it passed Congress with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/technology/tiktok-ban-congress.html" title="">bipartisan support</a>. Lawmakers said Beijing could pressure ByteDance to extract sensitive data on American users or influence TikTok content to serve the Chinese government’s interests.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>TikTok has said the Chinese government has no role in the company and that it has spent billions of dollars to address U.S. security concerns. ByteDance has headquarters in Beijing and is subject to China’s control.</p><p>On Friday, the Supreme Court accepted the government’s national security rationale for the law, with the majority opinion pointing to “TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects.”</p><p>Lisa Monaco, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement after the Supreme Court’s ruling that the process would play out “over time.”</p><p>TikTok said the Biden administration’s comments were not enough to satisfy other companies that they would not run afoul of the law if they continued to distribute and maintain the app. Those companies could face penalties as high as $5,000 for each TikTok user who accesses the app inside the United States after the ban takes effect.</p><p>“The statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok’s availability to over 170 million Americans,” the company said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The loss of that user base would be significant, but not the biggest TikTok has suffered. In 2020, it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/business/tiktok-india-ban.html" title="">banned in India</a>, where it had 200 million users. As in the United States, the authorities in India cited national security concerns for their decision against TikTok.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who takes office Monday, has previously indicated his support for TikTok and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/trump-tiktok-executive-order.html" title="">considering an executive order</a> to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States.</p><p>But it’s unclear if an executive order by Mr. Trump could effectively halt a ban. Legal experts said he could direct the Justice Department not to enforce the law, or delay enforcement for a set period, but how such an executive order would fare if challenged in court is uncertain.</p><p>Mr. Trump could also find a buyer, which would allow him to extend the deadline by 90 days if a viable deal is on the table. But no clear buyers have emerged.</p><p>It was unclear what 90-day extension Mr. Trump was weighing when he spoke with NBC News on Saturday.</p><p>“We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” he told NBC. If he does grant the app a 90-day extension, “I’ll probably announce it on Monday,” he added.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David McCabe is a Times reporter who covers the complex legal and policy issues created by the digital economy and new technologies.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-mccabe">More about David McCabe</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/apple-incorporated">Apple Incorporated</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/alphabet-inc">Alphabet Inc.</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-supreme-court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/tiktok">TikTok</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/technology/17tiktok-goes-dark-sunday-apple-google.html">325</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li><li><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/technology/17tiktok-goes-dark-sunday-apple-google.html">325</a></span></p></div></span></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
