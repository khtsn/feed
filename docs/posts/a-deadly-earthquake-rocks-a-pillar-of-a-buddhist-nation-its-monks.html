Buddhist monks chanted verses, praying for the deceased, who had been one of them.</p><p>One monk, Ashin Javanar Linkhara, then held his dead colleague’s robe to his forehead and whispered the phrase used to announce the death of a loved one, <em>“</em>Impermanent, alas, are all formations.” He was clutching a dusty, thin and slightly torn cotton blanket that had belonged to the dead monk, Ashin Pyinnyar Tharmi, 27. It was found near his body in the rubble of a monastery in Mandalay, Myanmar, that was toppled by the powerful earthquake last month.</p><p>The monk’s funeral concluded soon after, with more cremations following that day, instead of the dayslong ceremonies typically held for monks.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A monk killed in the earthquake is cremated at a cemetery in Mandalay.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Myanmar was already in a humanitarian crisis before the disaster, ravaged by a long civil war. The earthquake on March 28 killed thousands of people and also struck a devastating blow to an underpinning of society: the country’s Buddhist clergy. Thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/asia/earthquake-devastates-myanmars-cultural-sites.html" title="">religious monuments</a> and buildings were destroyed and many monks were buried under their monasteries. It is not known how many monks were killed.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Buddhism is the official religion in Myanmar and about 90 percent of its people adhere to the faith. It has shaped the country’s identity and moral code but has also been fused with nationalism. In recent years, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/world/asia/extremism-rises-among-myanmar-buddhists-wary-of-muslim-minority.html" title="">extremist movement</a> has led to Buddhist lynch mobs killing hundreds of Muslims.</p><p>Some monks have at times stood up to the military, which has ruled Myanmar for most of its post-colonial history. But most stayed silent after the generals toppled a civilian government in 2021, some even giving blessings to the new rulers.</p><p>But the monks are still held in high regard and seen as a source of solace and humanitarian aid, especially after natural disasters like the recent earthquake. The junta, critics say, has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake-aid.html" title="">blocking and restricting aid</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed pagoda in Sagaing, a town in central Myanmar that was at the quake’s epicenter.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The clergy have an outsized role in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city and a center for Buddhist learning. Roughly 50,000 monks were estimated to be living in the city before the earthquake.</p><p>When the earthquake struck, monks from monasteries in Mandalay were taking exams to qualify for higher ranks at a religious hall in the city.</p><p>Ashin Nanda Sariya, a monk, said he was in the building when the earthquake hit. As it collapsed, his roommate’s hand was trapped under a chunk of falling concrete. A rescue volunteer said if the hand was not amputated, he faced a deadly infection. So his friend asked for a knife and cut off his own hand. But he never made it.</p><p>“I still feel really heartbroken that he had to die like that just because there were no trained rescue workers or proper equipment in Myanmar,” Nanda said.</p><p>Monasteries in Myanmar are more than just places of worship: They serve as shelters for the homeless, schools, and a place for the community to congregate. Now hundreds of monasteries lie in rubble. Among them are two influential ones in Mandalay:the Old and New Masoeyein Monasteries, which are like Buddhist universities for the local community.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Monks and volunteers helping out at the destroyed Old Masoeyein monastery. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It was also in these centers that the Buddhist nationalist movement, Ma Ba Tha, or the Organization for the Protection of Race and Religion, was formed. It has aligned with the junta and kept up a steady stream of anti-Muslim rhetoric.</p><p>Win Zaw, 50, a Mandalay resident who visits the Old Masoeyein monastery regularly, said he, and many other people in Myanmar, saw the collapse of monasteries and pagodas as “a bad sign, like the country is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/world/asia/myanmar-quake-junta.html" title="">under a curse</a>.”</p><p>“It’s a sign that the old times are ending and a new Myanmar might be coming,” he said.</p><p>U Eaindra Sakka Viwuntha is the abbot of the Old Masoeyein monastery and a leader of the Ma Ba Tha movement. He said that his mother and sister had died in the earthquake, buried under a collapsed building.</p><p>“We do not blame the ground or the sky,” he said. “In Buddhism, we understand that all things arise and pass away, even temples, even lives.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-12"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The U Hla Thein hall, where hundreds of monks were taking an exam when the earthquake struck.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In the wake of the earthquake, people in Myanmar are still trying to figure out what the future holds. In the past five years they have faced the coronavirus pandemic, a coup and the ensuing civil war, as well as other natural disasters like floods. But dwelling on the tragedies has not been an option for most.</p><p>There is too much to do. People traveled from far-flung parts of the country to distribute goods to those in need. While soldiers stood aside, volunteers combed through rubble with their hands. Shopkeepers gave out popsicles and longyis, wraparound garments that are worn by men and women alike in Myanmar, to thank volunteers.</p><p>When the earthquake struck, Javanar, the monk who presided over the funeral, was in the same monastery as his friend Pyinnyar. But he was on the third floor, at the top, and survived.</p><p>Pyinnyar, who was on the ground floor, did not.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Soldiers inside The Old Masoeyein monastery in Mandalay, in April</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Buddhism teaches us not to ask why it happened, but how we meet it,” Javanar said. “With calm, with care, and with compassion for those who suffer.”</p><p>It was a sentiment shared by other monks who survived the earthquake. The Venerable U Zawtika, a senior monk, said that the trembling of the earth was a reminder that everything is impermanent, not just people’s lives, but even the ground beneath their feet.</p><p>“The earthquake is not sent to destroy us; it is simply the earth shifting, as it has for eons,” he said. “When tragedy comes, we grieve. We do not deny our pain. But we also chant, we meditate, we remember the Buddha’s words: ‘All that is subject to arising is subject to ceasing.’”</p><p>“In this way, we don’t cling,” he added. “We practice compassion for the lost, the suffering, and even for ourselves. That is how we endure.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed statue in a pagoda in Sagaing, in April.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>On Saturday afternoon in Mandalay, after the ceremony for Pyinyyar was over, the body of another monk arrived by ambulance. His shaved head and maroon robe were caked with dust. He had been found on Friday afternoon, pinned beneath debris inside the collapsed religious hall where the monks had been taking exams.</p><p>A young monk gently poured water over the dead man’s right hand using a small bowl, symbolizing his release from worldly attachments.</p><p>The body was then zipped up in a black body bag and transported to the city crematory. It was then placed on top of wood on a platform in a patch of open land.</p><p>A monk then sprinkled a fragrant powder. It was made of sandalwood, which Buddhists believe is a reminder of the impermanence of life. Then, a volunteer lit the pyre, and flecks of ashes swirled in the air.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
