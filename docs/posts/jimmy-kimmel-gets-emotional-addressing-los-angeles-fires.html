We got Catwoman; we got a lot of Spider-Men. I mean, there are so many Spider-Men — Spider-Man after Spider-Man. And when the fires broke out here, those heroes did nothing. They did not help us at all. But then the real superheroes swooped in. The Aquamen, if you will.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p><p>“Tonight, I don’t want to get into all the vile and irresponsible and stupid things our alleged future president and his gaggle of scumbags chose to say during our darkest and most terrifying hour. The fact that they chose to attack our firefighters, who apparently aren’t white enough to be out there, risking their lives on our behalf is — it’s disgusting, but it’s not surprising. Instead, I want to focus on thanking those men and women, because that’s all we should be doing right now, and we should never stop thanking them.” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-6c50f109">The Punchiest Punchlines (Strings Attached Edition)</h2></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“You know who’s not helping? Congressional Republicans, because they want strings attached to California’s fire aid. That is an awful, awful way to respond to any emergency: ‘911, what’s in it for me?’” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Yes, we must demand changes to clearly liberal policies like wind. First, it’s blowing one way, then it’s blowing the other. It’s time to end the bisexual breeze.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“Remember when hurricanes hit Florida a few months ago, and everyone, they were saying the Democrats, the far left secretly control the rain? Well, I think we finally proved we do not, OK?” <em>— JIMMY KIMMEL</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="link-3f07bc9e">The Bits Worth Watching</h2><p>Bad Bunny crashed Jimmy Fallon’s monologue to co-host “The Tonight Show” on Monday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p><h2 id="link-102ce59">What We’re Excited About on Tuesday Night</h2></p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The actor and “Saturday Night Live” alumna Aidy Bryant will stop by Tuesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers” to discuss her role in “All In: Comedy About Love.”</p><h2 id="link-12f48db0">Also, Check This Out</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cynthia Erivo has been nominated for a Golden Globe and a SAG Award for her turn as Elphaba in “Wicked.” Will an Oscar nomination be next?</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
