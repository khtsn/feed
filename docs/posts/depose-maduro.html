    <h1>Depose Maduro</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Donald Trump has set some grandiose foreign-policy goals for his second term, from buying Greenland to ending the war in Ukraine “in a day.” Here’s one goal that is overdue, morally right and in our national security interest: deposing the regime of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, through coercive diplomacy if possible or force if necessary.</p><p>Last week, Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term after a fraudulent election last July that independent surveys show he lost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-election-results.html" title="">by about 35 percentage points</a>. His opponent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-edmundo-gonzalez-biden-dc.html" title="">Edmundo González</a>, is in exile; the head of the opposition movement, María Corina Machado, had to <a href="https://nytimes.com/2025/01/09/world/americas/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-detained.html" title="">spend months in hiding</a>. As many as 10 Americans <a href="https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-detained-americans-maduro-inauguration-trump-e53e88838f5f06a7f207d0d090d5212b" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are languishing in Venezuelan jails</a> on dubious charges. The regime has treated past American prisoners as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XliyWtN1yX4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">political hostages</a>.</p><p>That’s not even the worst of it. As of November, the regime held an estimated <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/18/nx-s1-5191775/venezuela-still-holds-hundreds-of-political-prisoners-dozens-are-minors" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,800 political prisoners</a>. Since Maduro came to power, <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/emergencies/venezuela-situation" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close to eight million Venezuelans have fled the country</a>, amounting to a quarter of the population; at least 600,000 are now in the United States. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-hunger-stalks-presidential-election-2024-07-09/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Malnutrition affects millions</a>; the crime rate was among <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/crime-rate-by-country" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the highest in the world in 2024</a>. This is a country that was once among the wealthiest in Latin America.</p><p>And Maduro continues to court our enemies, starting with Iran, which has reportedly established a “<a href="https://www.latintimes.com/iran-increases-military-presence-venezuela-drone-factory-maduro-claims-new-term-office-despite-571806" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drone development base</a>” at a Venezuelan air base.</p></div></div>
