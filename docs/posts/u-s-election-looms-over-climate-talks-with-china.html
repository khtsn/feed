Trump returns to the White House, he is expected to withdraw the United States from the global fight against climate change, as he did during his first term, and release any pressure on China to step up its efforts.</p><p>“That would at best deflate the momentum on global climate negotiations,” said Kelly Sims Gallagher, the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Under the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations are considering a new set of climate goals, detailing how much their governments will cut carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases through 2035.</p><p>But the president of China, Xi Jinping, has also made it clear that his country will not give in to pressure from the United States or any other nation when it comes to climate concerns. Last year, while John Kerry, Mr. Podesta’s predecessor as climate envoy, was in Beijing for climate discussions, Mr. Xi insisted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/world/asia/xi-china-climate-kerry.html?searchResultPosition=6" title="">in a speech</a> that China would pursue its goals to phase out carbon dioxide pollution at its own pace and in its own way. China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/climate/us-china-climate-agreement.html" title="">did agree</a>, however, to displace fossil fuels with clean energy.</p><p>The moves made by the United States and China, which together release nearly 40 percent of the world’s climate pollution into the atmosphere, will have planetary consequences, energy experts said.</p><p>At risk is the world’s ability to limit global warming to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/climate/global-warming-dangerous-threshold.html" title="">1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit,</a> compared with preindustrial times. Temperature rise above that level means the planet will see significantly more extreme heat, droughts, floods, rising seas and species extinction, scientists have warned. The planet has already warmed an average of 1.2 degrees Celsius.</p><p>China, which has been the world’s biggest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases for most of the past two decades, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/climate/china-greenhouse-gas-emissions-plateau.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">seemingly on the verge of hitting an emissions plateau</a>. Mr. Xi had pledged to reach that point by 2030, but it may be happening even sooner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Part of that may be connected to China’s slowing economy, but also the breakneck speed at which it is replacing coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, with wind and solar energy. Last year alone, China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/china-solar-energy-exports.html" title="">installed more solar panels</a> than the United States had in its entire history, and connected most of them to its electricity grid. Almost two-thirds of big wind and solar plants under construction globally are in China, according to <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/report/china-continues-to-lead-the-world-in-wind-and-solar-with-twice-as-much-capacity-under-construction-as-the-rest-of-the-world-combined/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Energy Monitor</a>, a nongovernmental organization. That is more than eight times the wind and solar capacity being planned in the United States.</p><p>Still, experts believe that if China is serious about helping to limit global temperatures to 1.5 degrees, it must cut emissions across its economy by at least 30 percent from current levels by 2035.</p><p>One of Mr. Podesta’s challenges this week has been to try to convince Chinese leaders that America can be trusted to act on climate change even if Mr. Trump wins the White House.</p><p>The Trump campaign mocked the Biden administration’s efforts at climate diplomacy.</p><p>“No one believes Kamala Harris is interested in or tough enough to get Beijing to lower their emissions,” Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, said in a statement. “She’s failed for the last 3.5 years as vice president and will fail again if elected.”</p><p>Ms. Leavitt also said that Mr. Trump would reduce U.S. emissions “while standing up to Communist China.” But Mr. Trump, who has mocked climate change, is promoting more production and burning of fossil fuels, the chief driver of global warming.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Mr. Biden’s abrupt decision in late July to end his bid for re-election and Ms. Harris’s ascent as the Democratic nominee took many in China by surprise and may cause Mr. Xi and other leaders to recalculate.</p><p>“Earlier this year I think China was expecting a Trump scenario,” said Kate Logan, the associate director for climate at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a nonprofit group. “Now they’re basically thinking about what would four more years of sustained engagement and pressure look like from the United States.”</p><p>Yao Zhe, the global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, agreed that a Harris presidency would probably mean continued pressure on Chinese leaders to up the ante on climate change. But a Trump presidency could lead China to a similar position, she said. If the United States were to leave the Paris pact, China may opt to fill the leadership vacuum.</p><p>“The U.S. election will inevitably have impact on China’s consideration,” Ms. Yao said. “I don’t think it’s the deciding factor on China’s ambition, but it’s still a factor that can’t be ignored.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Lisa Friedman is a Times reporter who writes about how governments are addressing climate change and the effects of those policies on communities.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/lisa-friedman">More about Lisa Friedman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div>
