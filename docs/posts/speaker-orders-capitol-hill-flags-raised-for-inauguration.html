    <h1>Speaker Orders Capitol Hill Flags Raised for Inauguration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday announced that American flags at the Capitol would be temporarily raised on Monday for President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, effectively defying a presidential order put in place last month to mourn the death of former President Jimmy Carter.</p><p>The move came after Mr. Trump complained that flags were scheduled to be at half-staff during his inaugural ceremony. President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/29/proclamation-announcing-the-death-of-james-earl-carter-jr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff for one month following Mr. Carter’s death on Dec. 29</a>, following tradition and <a href="https://www.legion.org/advocacy/flag-advocacy/flag-code" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. flag code</a>.</p><p>“On Jan. 20, the flags at the Capitol will fly at full staff to celebrate our country coming together behind the inauguration of our 47th president, Donald Trump,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement announcing the change. He said flags would return to half-staff the next day to continue honoring Mr. Carter through the end of January.</p><p>Earlier this month Mr. Trump expressed his frustration over the possibility of flags remaining lowered during his inauguration, saying in a post on social media that, “Democrats are all ‘giddy’” about the imagery. He made it clear that he would push for a change, adding that “no American can be happy about it.”</p></div></div>
