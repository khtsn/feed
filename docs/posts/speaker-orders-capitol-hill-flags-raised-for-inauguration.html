Trump’s inauguration, effectively defying a presidential order put in place last month to mourn the death of former President Jimmy Carter.</p><p>The move came after Mr. Trump complained that flags were scheduled to be at half-staff during his inaugural ceremony. President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/29/proclamation-announcing-the-death-of-james-earl-carter-jr/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff for one month following Mr. Carter’s death on Dec. 29</a>, following tradition and <a href="https://www.legion.org/advocacy/flag-advocacy/flag-code" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. flag code</a>.</p><p>“On Jan. 20, the flags at the Capitol will fly at full staff to celebrate our country coming together behind the inauguration of our 47th president, Donald Trump,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement announcing the change. He said flags would return to half-staff the next day to continue honoring Mr. Carter through the end of January.</p><p>Earlier this month Mr. Trump expressed his frustration over the possibility of flags remaining lowered during his inauguration, saying in a post on social media that, “Democrats are all ‘giddy’” about the imagery. He made it clear that he would push for a change, adding that “no American can be happy about it.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Let’s see how it plays out,” he said.</p><p>Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters this month that Mr. Biden was not considering modifying or briefly suspending his flag order to accommodate Monday’s ceremonies.</p><p>Shortly after Mr. Carter’s funeral services, American flags at Trump’s private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, were raised back to full height. And in a move of solidarity with the incoming president, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas also ordered all flags be raised to full staff at the state’s capitol and other state buildings for Inauguration Day.</p><p>“While we honor the service of a former president, we must also celebrate the service of an incoming president,” <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-orders-flags-to-full-staff-in-honor-of-inauguration-day" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Abbott said in a statement</a> on Monday announcing the change.</p><p>Mr. Trump had asserted that his would have been the first presidential inauguration where flags were not flying at full staff.
