</span> <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/473242/edward-gaming-vs-bilibili-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1-lr3" target="_blank">2-1</a> in the lower bracket of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/event/2359/champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1/playoffs" target="_blank">the VCT China 2025 Stage 1 playoffs</a> to secure the final regional playoff slot for Masters Toronto. </p>

<p>This tournament was seemingly going according to plan for the former Champions, who frequently won their regional tournaments through the lower bracket, but <span data-ref-id="2">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/48878/rushia">
		rushia	</a>
</span> and BLG stomped on the regional powerhouse to go to Toronto.  Plus, this was a big win for BLG due to their tough record specifically against EDG, winning their first VCT series over the former champs.</p>

<p>The match started with Fracture, with Bilibili picking the map to try and compete against the <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/3520/zmjjkk">
		ZmjjKK	</a>
</span> Neon. <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4885/whzy">
		whzy	</a>
</span> had to match up well against him, but as the map went on, it only reminded viewers why ZmjjKK was the Champions MVP on Neon. Starting on attack, EDG lost the pistol but still won five rounds in a row to help end the first half up 7-5. </p>

<p>Even after they lost their second pistol on the map, EDG won five rounds in a row again to secure the map 13-8. ZmjjKK ended Fracture with 26 kills in 21 rounds, a map rating of 1.48, and an absurd ADR of 228. </p>

<p>Next up was Icebox, with both Duelists moving onto Jett while the rest of their team tried to support them as best as possible. The key difference between the two comps was the Harbor and Sova from BLG, while EDG ran Tejo and KAY/O. Like Fracture, BLG won the first pistol, but this time they could build momentum and end the first half up 9-3. <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4774/knight">
		Knight	</a>
</span> was able to frag alongside whzy to end that attack side up significantly.</p>

<p>EDG won the second half pistol, their first pistol win of the series, but BLG were able to trade rounds enough to secure the map win 13-8. Only two players from EDG hit double digits for kills, while every player on BLG had at least 12 kills on Icebox. </p>


<p><em>rushia gets four to end Icebox against EDG.</em></p>

<p>However, this was the redemption map for whzy, who outdueled ZmjjKK with 22 kills, a 1.26 map rating, and 196 ADR.</p>

<p>The series came down to Pearl, with EDG running double Duelist while BLG stuck with whzy on Yoru. BLG won the first pistol, and EDG had to play for the retake for the entirety of their defense. <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/15559/chichoo">
		CHICHOO	</a>
</span> was able to start hot after a rough time on Icebox, but <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/51244/jieni7">
		Jieni7	</a>
</span> only managed one kill the entire half. </p>

<p>Even with the struggles on EDG, they managed to keep their deficit to only 7-5. rushia was a monster on the Astra, seemingly getting at least two kills per round at a whim and stopping any aggressive moves from EDG.</p>


<p><em>CHICHOO and whzy trade round-winning moments in an EDG round win.</em></p>

<p>After a tense first half, ZmjjKK got two entry kills to start the second pistol, but lost a post-plant off four kills from Knight. BLG almost converted the bonus, but <span data-ref-id="8">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4742/smoggy">
		Smoggy	</a>
</span> saved the map in a close 1v1 against Knight. Even then, the BLG defense looked strong with the Vyse from <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/40845/levius">
		Levius	</a>
</span> and the continued form from rushia and Knight. </p>

<p>A clutch round on round 17 from CHICHOO and Smoggy kept hopes alive for EDG, and the comeback almost led to a tie game. BLG were stalwart on A site to keep a tight lead at 11-9, and an Operator buy from ZmjjKK on attack cost EDG in the following round on their post-plant. </p>

<p>CHICHOO pulled his team back in the fight on Vyse, but a great round from Jieni7 was quickly countered by rushia, and that ended the map at 13-11. BLG has officially eliminated EDG from the Stage 1 playoffs and secured their slot at Masters Toronto. Rushia ended the series with a 1.28 rating, 58 kills, 35 assists, 83% KAST, and a dominant map three to complete the upset win.</p>

<p>With this win, BLG will also stay alive in the Stage 1 playoffs and <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/473243/wolves-esports-vs-bilibili-gaming-champions-tour-2025-china-stage-1-lbf" target="_blank">will face Wolves Esports</a> in the lower final for a chance at better seeding for Toronto.</p>
