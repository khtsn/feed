She relishes in the sensuality of solitude and the pursuit of her art, a practice she situates in a long lineage of women who have made similar trade-offs: the Benedictine abbess <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/26/news/the-celebrity-saint-poetry-music-feminism-and-herbal-remedies-12th.html" title="">Hildegard von Bingen</a> and the authors Virginia Woolf and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/17/arts/octavia-butler-vision-kindred.html" title="">Octavia Butler,</a> to name a few.</p><p>Knopf, June 3</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-32b3a29d"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176399/buckley-by-sam-tanenhaus/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buckley</a></h2><h3 id="link-687da9a5"><span>by Sam Tanenhaus</span></h3><p>Tanenhaus, a former editor of the Times Book Review, exposes the roots of the modern conservative movement through this authoritative biography of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/business/media/28buckley.html" title="">William F. Buckley Jr.,</a> the firebrand writer and commentator who shaped it. As Buckley’s only authorized biographer, Tanenhaus draws from troves of his private papers and extensive interviews with the man himself.</p><p>Random House, June 3</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-2d9a487"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/611388/the-gunfighters-by-bryan-burrough/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Gunfighters</a></h2><h3 id="link-23241c29"><span>by Bryan Burrough</span></h3><p>In his follow-up to the best selling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/books/review/forget-the-alamo-bryan-burrough-chris-tomlinson-jason-stanford-a-single-star-and-bloody-knuckles-bill-minutaglio.html?searchResultPosition=11" title="">“Forget the Alamo,”</a> Burrough offers a myth-busting look at the Wild West, though still replete with outlaws, cattle drives and carnage. In Burrough’s telling, the Lone Star State, at the crossroads of anarchic frontier culture and Old South dueling culture, has been a hotbed of violence since its inception, making it a haven for gunslingers and, more formatively, the newspapermen and Hollywood producers who wanted to dramatize them.</p><p>Penguin Press, June 3</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-5700c2ae"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/738849/how-to-lose-your-mother-by-molly-jong-fast/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to Lose Your Mother</a></h2><h3 id="link-4e150658"><span>by Molly Jong-Fast</span></h3><p>“I was born to privilege, born on third base, but desperate to strike out and go home,” writes Jong-Fast of her childhood in the shadow of her fame-hungry feminist icon mother, the writer Erica Jong. As Jong’s health declines, Jong-Fast — now an esteemed writer in her own right — offers an unflinching, albeit not unkind, reflection on the relationship between mothers and daughters.</p><p>Viking, June 3</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-1eb721f5"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/552034/baddest-man-by-mark-kriegel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baddest Man</a></h2><h3 id="link-118355db"><span>by Mark Kriegel</span></h3><p>A veteran sports journalist’s nuanced history of the heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson offers a portrait of a mercurial young street fighter from Brooklyn, thrust onto the world stage — with all its attendant perks and indignities. Though the narrative ends in 1988, at the height of Tyson’s boxing career, it sets in motion “the snowballing phenomenon” of one of the most controversial athletes in American history.</p><p>Penguin Press, June 3</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-624e5c3f"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741809/murderland-by-caroline-fraser/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Murderland</a></h2><h3 id="link-428b5233"><span>by Caroline Fraser</span></h3><p>Fraser begins with a simple true-crime curiosity — why did the Pacific Northwest have so many serial killers in the ’70s and ’80s? — and expands her gaze to encompass the recent history of American industrialization and the hidden consequences of environmental degradation. The result is a scientific re-examination of Ted Bundy and his ilk, and the toxic chemicals that may have rotted their brains.</p><p>Penguin Press, June 10</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-43d0c89e"><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374615406/themobiusbook/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Möbius Book</a></h2><h3 id="link-6543e3e6"><span>by Catherine Lacey</span></h3><p>Split into fiction and memoir — two narratives, each beginning at either cover — Lacey’s latest book draws its cohesion from ruminations on religion, permanence and waning relationships. In a novella, two friends, Marie and Edie, discuss a mutual friendship over tequila as a fresh puddle of blood collects outside a neighbor’s door. Elsewhere, Lacey processes the aftermath of a breakup and the possibility of new love via reflections on Annie Baker, Dr. Watson and Christianity.</p><p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, June 17</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-31a4eb8d">“<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717216/make-it-ours-by-robin-givhan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Make It Ours</a>”</h2><h3 id="link-551bd1ae"><span>by Robin Givhan</span></h3><p>This biography of Virgil Abloh, the men&#39;s wear chief at Louis Vuitton until his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/28/style/virgil-abloh-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">death in 2021,</a> doubles as a lens into a staid luxury industry undergoing rapid transformation. Givhan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic, deftly lays out how streetwear’s grass roots revolution challenged fashion’s stuffy notions of taste, exclusivity and their consumers — and paved the way for a hip-hop provocateur like Abloh to rise to the top.</p><p>Crown, June 24</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>JULY</p><h2 id="link-5427b4b8"><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Beast-in-the-Clouds/Nathalia-Holt/9781668027745" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Beast in the Clouds</a></h2><h3 id="link-37d912ce"><span>by Nathalia Holt</span></h3><p>In 1928-29, Theodore Roosevelt’s two eldest sons went on a swashbuckling global adventure to prove the existence of the until-then mystical panda bear. Holt chronicles their journey into the Himalayan wilderness — marred by sickness, violence and extreme weather — and what the landmark mission meant for the future of wildlife conservation.</p><p>Atria, July 1</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-4a6e634e"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/771662/a-marriage-at-sea-by-sophie-elmhirst/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Marriage at Sea</a></h2><h3 id="link-d36490b"><span>by Sophie Elmhirst</span></h3><p>In the early ’70s, an eccentric married couple ditched their landlocked lives for grand plans to sail to New Zealand. Elmhirst’s book opens just as a sperm whale crashes into their boat, kicking off a harrowing 117 days stranded at sea. But while the physical circumstances are extraordinary, the psychological drama is all too universal. “What else is a marriage,” asks Elmhirst, “if not being stuck on a small raft with someone and trying to survive?”</p><p>Riverhead, July 8</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-2ce66ba7"><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/On-Her-Game/Christine-Brennan/9781668090190" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On Her Game</a></h2><h3 id="link-1d918498"><span>by Christine Brennan</span></h3><p>Caitlin Clark, the highest-scoring college basketball player in N.C.A.A. history, was a revelation to most observers following her standout season in 2024. Brennan draws on interviews and behind-the-scenes reporting in this energetic account of that campaign, and explains how the ensuing explosion in popularity of women’s basketball is a legacy of Title IX’s passage in 1972.</p><p>Scribner, July 8</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-55c6cf80"><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sam-kean/dinner-with-king-tut/9780316496551/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dinner with King Tut</a></h2><h3 id="link-776ceb33"><span>by Sam Kean</span></h3><p>In the budding discipline known as experimental archaeology, researchers are driven by the full spectrum of human senses. Kean follows them on zany investigations and tactile recreations of ancient life that involve hunting with primitive spears, baking with ancient yeast strains, wrapping human mummies, taking perilous boats out to sea and building Roman-style roads.</p><p>Little, Brown, July 8</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-41c13e0b"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/751421/sloppy-by-rax-king/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sloppy, Or: Doing It All Wrong</a></h2><h3 id="link-5447eca7"><span>by Rax King</span></h3><p>King’s first book, “Tacky,” was a sharp and spirited essay collection on pop culture and the pleasures of “bad” taste (think: Creed, the Cheesecake Factory and “Jersey Shore”). This follow-up, which also enumerates “my mistakes and crimes,” as the author <a href="https://people.com/rax-king-gets-sloppy-in-new-essay-collection-exclusive-8745758" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has put it</a>, is constructed out of 17 observant essays on the compulsions and vices — overspending, shoplifting, addiction, to name a few — that have molded her.</p><p>Vintage, July 29</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>AUGUST</p><h2 id="link-1b149a96"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/777210/tonight-in-jungleland-by-peter-ames-carlin/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tonight in Jungleland</a></h2><h3 id="link-6c8bb9f6"><span>by Peter Ames Carlin</span></h3><p>Carlin, who has published biographies of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/books/review/rem-biography-peter-ames-carlin.html" title="">R.E.M.,</a> Paul Simon and the Boss himself, pulls back the curtain on the making of Springsteen’s “Born to Run” album 50 years after its release. Drawing on interviews with the artist and his inner circle, Carlin revisits how each song was written and recorded while shedding light on the arduous studio sessions and their parallels to Springsteen’s career.</p><p>Doubleday, Aug. 5</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-2c9d0b5b"><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250206220/blessingsanddisasters/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blessings and Disasters</a></h2><h3 id="link-7a0c2d9f"><span>by Alexis Okeowo</span></h3><p>Braiding personal narrative with Southern history, Okeowo, a contributing writer at The New Yorker, reckons with her love for Montgomery, Alabama, where she was raised by Nigerian parents, despite the state’s legacy of chattel slavery and Indigenous dispossession and its more recent evolution into the backdrop for Amazon warehouses, auto plants and culture war lawsuits.</p><p>Holt, Aug. 5</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-57175e23"><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690562/king-of-kings-by-scott-anderson/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">King of Kings</a></h2><h3 id="link-177f2654"><span>by Scott Anderson</span></h3><p>Much like his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/books/review/lawrence-in-arabia-by-scott-anderson.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">“Lawrence in Arabia”</a> (2013), Anderson’s latest is an exercise in demystification. This absorbing account of the 1979 Iranian revolution unravels the story of how the nation’s seemingly invulnerable leader, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, was forced into exile, and the ensuing hostage crisis that rattled American confidence and singed its reputation in the Middle East.</p><p>Doubleday, Aug. 5</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><hr/><h2 id="link-17a63"><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Tart/Slutty-Cheff/9781668070222" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tart</a></h2><h3 id="link-366f622a"><span>by Slutty Cheff</span></h3><p>After quitting a 9-to-5 in corporate marketing, Cheff, the anonymous author of this gritty memoir, breaks into London&#39;s fine dining world in the hopes of becoming a chef.
