Now, diplomats are fighting an uphill battle to revive the measure and pull the Middle East back from the brink of all-out war.</p><p><a href="https://unsco.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/s_res_17012006.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701</a>, which sought to create a demilitarized zone in southern Lebanon, has not prevented fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia group.</p><p>The cost of 1701’s failure is easy to see: Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Israel to escape Hezbollah rocket fire. And Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah has set off a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon, displacing more than one million people and killing more than 2,400 over the past year, most of them in the past few weeks, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.</p><p>On Oct. 1, Israel invaded Lebanon yet again, in an attempt to create the secure buffer zone that 1701 had promised to ensure.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“If the State of Lebanon and the world cannot keep Hezbollah away from our border, we have no choice but to do so ourselves,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, said on Oct. 1, shortly after announcing the ground invasion.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-7b6fea68">What is Resolution 1701?</h2><p>United Nations Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war, was intended to demilitarize southern Lebanon and protect Israel from cross-border attacks by Hezbollah.</p><p>It called on Israeli troops to withdraw from southern Lebanon and for Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River. The area between the Litani and the border, where much of the fighting had taken place, was to become a buffer zone, controlled by the Lebanese military and U.N. peacekeeping forces.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1701 in August 2006. It called for “an area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons” other than those belonging to Lebanon’s government and the U.N. peacekeeping force, known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/unifil-un-peacekeepers-lebanon.html" title="">United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon</a>, or UNIFIL.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-549d7b22">What went wrong?</h2><p>The resolution was never fully put in effect. UNIFIL was not empowered to use force against Hezbollah.

He said additional measures were needed to ensure it was carried out “fairly, accurately and transparently.”</p><p>The U.N. resolution “was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that no one did anything to implement it. The lack of implementation over those years contributed to the conflict that we are in today,” Mr. Hochstein said on Monday after meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, a key interlocutor between the United States and Hezbollah.</p><p>Matthew Levitt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said that the United States and its allies — including Gulf Arab states aligned with Israel against Iran and Hezbollah — should make clear that they would strongly support Lebanon’s government if it deployed meaningful army forces into the U.N. buffer zone.</p><p>But there is no easy path to get Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a retooled version of 1701 or to withdraw from southern Lebanon.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A car damaged by shrapnel from a rocket fired from Lebanon into Kiryat Ata, Israel, on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Hezbollah has vowed to keep fighting until Israel withdraws from Gaza. Resolution 1701 also called for “the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon,” not only in the country’s south. That implies demilitarizing Hezbollah entirely — an even mightier task.</p><p>Israel, for its part, seems determined to dismantle Hezbollah and create the buffer zone in southern Lebanon that 1701 promised but never delivered.</p><p>“In the absence of any diplomatic resolution to stop that rocket fire, we will do the job of pushing Hezbollah back behind the Litani River for the simple objective of getting our people back home,” added David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, this week.</p><p>Johnatan Reiss<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Ephrat Livni is a reporter for The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/dealbook">DealBook</a> newsletter, based in Washington.<span> </span></p></div></div><div><p>Michael Crowley covers the State Department and U.S. foreign policy for The Times.
