People living in Dallas, Fort Worth and Plano, Texas, as well as Oklahoma City are advised to keep an eye out for weather warnings.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The storms are expected to develop in the mid- to-late afternoon in the Southern Plains and then quickly push east and southeastward. The threat of severe weather will persist in parts of Texas and Oklahoma into the evening and overnight hours.</p><p>Active weather is also predicted across parts of the East Coast.</p><p>“There will be thunderstorms anywhere from Georgia up into the Mid-Atlantic and the main threat with that will be strong winds,” Mr. Chenard said.</p><p>The thunderstorms are expected to be “efficient rainfall producers,” the Weather Prediction Center said, with the highest threat for flash flooding across the Southern Plains. A portion of the Mid-Atlantic could also see heavy rainfall on Sunday.</p><p>On Monday, there’s a continued chance for thunderstorms between the Southern Plains and East Coast, but the focus of the greatest threat will shift into the Southeast, the Ohio Valley and the central Appalachians. .</p><p>“The main threat will probably be the wind again with the possibility of some hail and maybe a tornado,” Mr. Chenard said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>After Monday, the chance for thunderstorms is likely to continue but the threat of severe weather may lessen.</p></div></section><div><div><div><p>Amy Graff is a Times reporter covering weather, wildfires and earthquakes.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
