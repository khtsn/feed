Witnesses in the city of Rawalpindi, where Nur Khan is located, reported hearing at least three loud explosions, with one describing a “large fireball” visible from miles away.</p><p>Within hours, Pakistan said it had retaliated using short-range surface-to-surface missiles against several locations in India, including the Udhampur and Pathankot air bases and a missile storage facility. “An eye for an eye,” the Pakistani military said in a statement.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>India, however, also described its action on Saturday as retaliation. The Indian military said it had struck several Pakistani military targets, two of them radar sites, in response to a wave of Pakistani attacks on 26 locations using drones, long-range weapons and fighter planes. There was “limited damage” to equipment and personnel at four Indian air force bases, Vyomika Singh, an Indian air force officer, said at a news conference on Saturday.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paramilitary soldiers patrolling in Dal Lake after loud explosions were heard in Srinagar, in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mukhtar Khan/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“It is Pakistani actions that have constituted provocation and escalation. In response, India has defended and reacted in a responsible and measured fashion,” India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said.</p><p>Between the claims and counterclaims, it was increasingly clear that the night involved some of the heaviest military engagement from both sides since the armed confrontation began on Wednesday.</p><p>Both countries say that they want to de-escalate, but the confrontation has only intensified since India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan on Wednesday. India had accused Pakistan of harboring terrorist groups that carried out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/world/asia/kashmir-terrorist-attack.html" title="">a deadly attack</a> on tourists last month in India-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan has denied involvement.</p><p>Since then, the crisis has spiraled into the most expansive confrontation between the two nations in half a century, with fierce fighting along sections of their border and drone attacks and other strikes hitting deeper within each country. Each response has come with waves of claims, counterclaims and disinformation.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Security personnel cordoned off a road near Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aamir Qureshi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>That has prompted alarm worldwide and diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and other countries with strong ties to both India and Pakistan.</p><p>Foreign ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations had also urged “maximum restraint from both India and Pakistan” in a joint statement on Friday, warning that “further military escalation poses a serious threat to regional stability.”</p><p>But that diplomatic pressure has yet to yield a breakthrough.</p><p>After the heavy military exchanges on Saturday morning, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with the foreign ministers of <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/secretary-rubios-call-with-indian-external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-2/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India</a> and <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/secretary-rubios-call-with-pakistani-deputy-prime-minister-foreign-minister-dar/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pakistan</a>, telling both sides that they needed to find ways to de-escalate and communicate directly to “avoid miscalculation,” according to readouts of the calls from the State Department.
