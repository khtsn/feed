There is fear of the Israeli warplanes that tear through the skies and carry out deadly airstrikes. There is fear of famine with only a trickle of aid coming in. There is fear of being displaced, yet again, by Israeli evacuation orders.</p><p>And now, there is increasing fear of being forgotten.</p><p>International attention has been diverted, first by deadly Israeli military raids into Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank this month, and this week by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/19/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas" title="">coordinated attacks against the militant group Hezbollah</a> in Lebanon. Israel’s leaders have increasingly signaled that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-war-focus-hezbollah-lebanon.html" title="">they intend to shift their focus</a> from the Gaza Strip to their northern border with Lebanon, in what the country’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, described this week as a “new phase of the war.”</p><p>But the war it is already waging in Gaza has not gone away. Israel, which says it wants to eradicate the armed group Hamas that led the Oct. 7 attack, has not stopped its airstrikes or ground attacks. </p><p>And some Gazans worry that the already sputtering efforts to reach a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas will be sidelined as tensions rise in other areas of the Middle East.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“Unfortunately, people see the attention going to the West Bank or Lebanon,” said Muhammad al-Masri, a 31-year-old accountant who has been forced to flee numerous times. “We don’t know what is going to happen here. It’s not just depression or misery. It’s a catastrophe in a terrifying way, and the situation is getting worse all the time.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Palestinian man carries the body of a relative killed in Israeli strikes Tuesday in central Gaza.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He played a brief clip that showed him and his family fleeing recently in the back of a truck, his sunburned face covered in sweat. “The displacement,” he said, letting the camera take in a road packed with people fleeing by vehicle and donkey carts, is “the worst thing people can live through.”</p><p>With humanitarian access restricted, about 96 percent of the population in Gaza still faces high levels of <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1157065/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acute food insecurity</a>, the <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/ipc-overview-and-classification-system/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Integrated Food Security Phase Classification</a>, a partnership of U.N. agencies and international humanitarian groups, reported this month.Nearly half a million people are facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, meaning families are suffering from an extreme lack of food and face starvation, the group reported.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>A separate <a href="https://www.nrc.no/news/2024/september/israels-siege-now-blocks-83-of-food-aid-reaching-gaza-new-data-reveals/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coalition of aid groups</a> working in Gaza analyzed recent data on aid entering the territory and said that Israel has “systematically blocked” entry of food, medicine, medical supplies, fuel and tents since the war began.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Palestinians on Tuesday after an Israeli airstrike on a crowded tent camp housing Palestinians displaced by the war.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>The organizations’ analysis found that as a result of the Israeli government’s restrictions on aid, 83 percent of the food Gazans need is not getting in.
