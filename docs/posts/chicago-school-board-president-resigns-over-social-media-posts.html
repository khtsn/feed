Mitchell Ikenna Johnson, were “not only hurtful but deeply disturbing,” the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2024/october/Chicago_School_Board_Of_Education_Resignation_Statement.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on Thursday.</p><p>The mayor said that he had asked for Mr. Johnson’s resignation, adding, “I want to be clear: Antisemitic, misogynistic and conspiratorial statements are unacceptable.”</p><p>In an interview on Friday, Mr. Johnson, 64, the former board president, defended his track record as an ally of the Jewish community, citing his past work with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights group.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“The people that have reacted strongest are choosing to forget the work I’ve done in that community, and that is a darn shame,” he said.</p><p>He said he apologized for his comments, which “could have been tempered with language that is not meant to be seen or heard as anti-Semitic.”</p><p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/10/new-chicago-education-board-president-has-history-of-antisemitic-pro-hamas-facebook-posts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Jewish Insider</a> published a report that included more than a dozen screenshots of Mr. Johnson’s Facebook page.</p><p>After the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel last year, he posted about the Middle East and invoked the Holocaust.</p><p>“The Nazi Germans’ ideology has been adopted by the Zionist Jews,” he wrote in February, <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/10/new-chicago-education-board-president-has-history-of-antisemitic-pro-hamas-facebook-posts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Jewish Insider reported</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In March, he wrote on Facebook, “The Israeli government offers a renewal of Nazi language once directed toward European Jews, ‘savages, dogs, vermin.’”</p><p>Mr. Johnson also appeared to back Hamas, writing in March, according to <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/10/new-chicago-education-board-president-has-history-of-antisemitic-pro-hamas-facebook-posts/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Jewish Insider</a>: “I have been saying this since October 2023.
