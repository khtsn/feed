Morvillo, a lawyer at Clifford Chance, and his wife.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Prosecutors in the city of Termini Imerese, just east of where the yacht went down, have been charged with opening a formal investigation into the sinking and determining what led to it.</p><p>The search for the missing passengers began on Monday but was suspended late at night. “Access limited to the bridge deck, with difficulty due to the presence of furnishings obstructing passage,” the firefighters wrote on social media on Monday.</p><p>The ship was lying on its right side, at a depth of about 165 feet, meaning that divers, working in pairs, could enter it only for about 12 minutes at a time, said Luca Cari, the spokesman for Italy’s national firefighter corps.</p><p>“Obviously everything fell and the space is very tight,” Mr. Cari said. The divers were having to remove obstacles, like furnishings and electrical wiring, that were “completely blocking passages.”</p><p>“It’s a very complicated operation, very difficult,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Elisabetta Povoledo is a reporter based in Rome, covering Italy, the Vatican and the culture of the region.
