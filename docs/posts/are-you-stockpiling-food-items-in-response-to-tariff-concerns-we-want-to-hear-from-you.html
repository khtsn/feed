On Tuesday the Trump administration initiated a 10 percent tariff on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/business/economy/trump-tariffs-china.html" title="">Chinese</a> goods, and steeper tariffs are set to take effect next month for imports from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-tariffs" title="">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-tariffs" title="">Canada</a>. President Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/business/economy/trump-tariffs-european-union.html" title="">the European Union</a>.</p><p>Economists broadly agree that the costs of tariffs are passed onto the consumer. That’s where you all, our readers, come in: We’re interested in hearing about any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/business/tariffs-prices-consumers.html" title="">food or drink items</a> (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/18/dining/olive-oil-tariffs.html" title="">olive oil, anyone?</a>) you or someone you know may be stockpiling in response to Mr. Trump’s tariff policies. We will read through the submissions and contact you if we’re interested in learning more about you and possibly publishing part of your story.</p><p>We won’t publish any part of your submission without reaching out to you and hearing back. We don’t use your contact information for any reason other than to follow up with you, and we don’t share it outside the Times newsroom.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
