Trump. He predicted Mr. Trump may be forced by Congress to moderate some of his proposals, while lightly criticizing some of his successor’s latest ideas.</p><p>“I want to make sure this transition goes smoothly, and all the talk about what he’s going to do and not do, I think there may be a little bit of an internal reckoning on his part,” he said.</p><p>Asked specifically about Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">pledge on Monday</a> to impose major tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as a means of forcing policy changes, Mr. Biden said the idea would only alienate close trading partners.</p><p>“I hope he rethinks it — I think it’s a counterproductive thing to do,” Mr. Biden told reporters.</p><p>“We have an unusual situation in America, we’re surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean and two allies — Mexico and Canada,” he said. “The last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Biden also said he had spoken to the three Americans who were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/asia/us-china-prisoner-swap.html" title="">freed on Wednesday as part of a prisoner swap</a> with China.</p><p>The president traveled to Nantucket on Tuesday as he has for decades, just hours after announcing a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hezbollah that briefly paused a tide of destruction in Lebanon.</p><p>He was joined by the first lady, Jill Biden, his children Ashley and Hunter Biden, as well as his son’s wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and their child Beau. While the president spent Wednesday at home, Dr. Biden perused clothing stores and boutiques along the main commercial street while tourists flocked and shopkeepers who have grown accustomed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/us/politics/biden-thanksgiving.html" title="">the Biden family’s visits</a> looked on unfazed.</p><p>Asked what he was grateful for this season, the president cited steps being taken toward an enduring peace in the Middle East.</p><p>“I’m thankful for my family, I’m thankful for the peaceful transition of the presidency, and I’m thankful for the fact that — I think with the grace of God and maybe a little bit of luck — we’re going to get some more progress in the Middle East.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
