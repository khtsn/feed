Thursday morning, delivering pumpkin pies to police officers, firefighters and medics on Nantucket and calling members of the armed services, continuing a <a href="https://n-magazine-archive.com/bidens-ode-to-nantucket/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">family tradition</a> they have followed since 1975.</p><p>While most residents sheltered inside on Thursday as rains swept across the island, President Biden grinned as he walked into the Nantucket fire station, shaking hands and trading baseball caps with the officers on duty while leading his grandson Beau through the hall.</p><p>The president reflected at some length on the political climate in the United States, urging Americans to “just remember who we are,” reject overly negative narratives, and be conscious about their news consumption.</p><p>Mr. Biden, reflecting on recent public opinion surveys that show majorities of Americans expressing concern about the direction of the country, said he believed that reflected shrinking audiences for traditional news sources and overly dour assessments on TV.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I think there’s an explanation for that,” he said. “You turn on the television, you don’t see a lot of good news.”</p><p>Even while he encouraged Americans to remain optimistic in the face of uncertainty, the president nonetheless anticipated hurdles ahead for President-elect Donald J. Trump. He predicted Mr. Trump may be forced by Congress to moderate some of his proposals, while lightly criticizing some of his successor’s latest ideas.</p><p>“I want to make sure this transition goes smoothly, and all the talk about what he’s going to do and not do, I think there may be a little bit of an internal reckoning on his part,” he said.</p><p>Asked specifically about Mr. Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/economy/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html" title="">pledge on Monday</a> to impose major tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as a means of forcing policy changes, Mr. Biden said the idea would only alienate close trading partners.</p><p>“I hope he rethinks it — I think it’s a counterproductive thing to do,” Mr. Biden told reporters.</p><p>“We have an unusual situation in America, we’re surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean and two allies — Mexico and Canada,” he said. “The last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Biden also said he had spoken to the three Americans who were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/asia/us-china-prisoner-swap.html" title="">freed on Wednesday as part of a prisoner swap</a> with China.</p><p>The president traveled to Nantucket on Tuesday as he has for decades, just hours after announcing a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hezbollah that briefly paused a tide of destruction in Lebanon.</p><p>He was joined by the first lady, Jill Biden, his children Ashley and Hunter Biden, as well as his son’s wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and their child Beau. While the president spent Wednesday at home, Dr. Biden perused clothing stores and boutiques along the main commercial street while tourists flocked and shopkeepers who have grown accustomed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/us/politics/biden-thanksgiving.html" title="">the Biden family’s visits</a> looked on unfazed.</p><p>Asked what he was grateful for this season, the president cited steps being taken toward an enduring peace in the Middle East.</p><p>“I’m thankful for my family, I’m thankful for the peaceful transition of the presidency, and I’m thankful for the fact that — I think with the grace of God and maybe a little bit of luck — we’re going to get some more progress in the Middle East.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/zach-montague">More about Zach Montague</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/hunter-biden">Hunter Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/jill-biden">Jill Biden</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics">U.S. Politics</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Inside the Biden Administration</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Washington.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Biden Cuts Intel’s Chip Award: </strong>The Silicon Valley company will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/business/economy/intel-chips-award-biden.html">receive less money from the CHIPS Act</a> after winning a $3 billion military contract and changing some of its investment commitments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Obesity Drugs: </strong>The Biden administration, in one of its last major policy directives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/upshot/obesity-drugs-medicare-medicaid.html">proposed that Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity medications</a>, a costly and probably popular move that the Trump administration would need to endorse to become official.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blinken and U.S. Allies Struggle with Wars: </strong>Top diplomats from the Group of 7 nations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/europe/blinken-allies-biden-presidency.html">tried to project unity on Ukraine while discussing differences over Israel</a> and anticipating the return of President-elect Donald Trump.</p></li><li><p><strong>Electric Vehicles: </strong>The Biden administration will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/biden-loans-ev-auto-industry.html">lend $6 billion to help Rivian build an electric car factory</a> in Georgia, part of an effort to lock in Democratic climate policies before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intel’s Chip Grant: </strong>The Biden administration plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/business/washington-curtails-intel-grant.html">reduce Intel’s preliminary $8.5 billion federal CHIPS grant</a>, a move that follows the company’s investment delays and broader business struggles.</p></li></ul></section></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
