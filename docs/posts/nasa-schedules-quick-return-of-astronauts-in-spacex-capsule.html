The weather is expected to be less favorable later in the week.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>NASA officials want to keep handover short to conserve supplies like food.</p><p>“We don’t want to lose any good opportunities that we might have in this case,” Dina Contella, deputy manager at NASA for the space station program, said during a news conference on Friday. “We’re trying to stretch the consumables.”</p><p>Undocking is scheduled for a little after 1 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday.</p><p>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore, along with Nick Hague of NASA and Aleksandr Gorbunov of the Russian space agency, will be in the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft — the one that Mr. Hague and Mr. Gorbunov took to space last September. The journey back will take about 17 hours.</p><p>The SpaceX Crew Dragon with the replacement crew — Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers of NASA, Takuya Onishi of Japanese space agency and Kirill Peskov of the Russian space agency — arrived at the International Space Station at 12:04 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday. After checks to ensure that the seal between spacecraft and space station was tight, the hatch opened one-and-a-half hours later and the crew of four received warm greetings from their colleagues.</p><p>For Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/briefing/bringing-astronauts-home.html" title="">it has been a long journey</a>. The two initially arrived at the International Space Station last June on what was meant to be a brief, dayslong test flight of a new Boeing Starliner spacecraft. Instead, after malfunctions in the capsule, NASA officials opted to leave the astronauts at the space station and bring back the Starliner empty.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore have lived on the space station for nine months, awaiting new crew members to relieve them of their duties so that operations can run smoothly. The capsule’s trip was due to launch in February but was delayed until this month.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The docking of the SpaceX capsule to the International Space Station on Sunday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA, via Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Nine months is not an unusually long stay in space — many astronauts on the space station live there for months, and some have even lived there for more than a year. Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore have used the time to conduct experiments, many exploring what the absence of gravity does to a body.</p><p>The pair’s unexpectedly long stay in orbit has intrigued space nerds, hobbyists and members of the public alike, fascinated by their fate. Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore have embraced their circumstances, broadcasting regularly from the station and speaking fondly about their layover in space.</p><p>“It makes you really want to enjoy every bit of your time that you have up here,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/podcasts/the-daily/nasa-spacex-astronauts-iss-launch.html" title="">Ms. Williams told “The Daily” last week</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><div><p>Ali Watkins covers international news and is based in London.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ali-watkins">More about Ali Watkins</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>Kenneth Chang, a science reporter at The Times, covers NASA and the solar system, and research closer to Earth.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kenneth-chang">More about Kenneth Chang</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/national-aeronautics-and-space-administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/spacex">SpaceX</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">What’s Up in Space and Astronomy</h2><h3>Keep track of things going on in our solar system and all around the universe.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p>Never miss a rocket launch, meteor shower, eclipse or other 2025 event that’s out of this world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2025/science/astronomy-space-calendar-events">our space and </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2025/science/astronomy-space-calendar-events">astronomy calendar</a>.</p></li><li><p>Scientists proposed an explanation for the formation of Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck near the lunar south pole, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/science/moon-canyons.html">each about the size of Earth’s Grand Canyon</a>.</p></li><li><p>After NASA canceled its VIPER rover, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/science/nasa-moon-rover-astrolab-astrobotic.html">an empty space was available on a private spacecraft that will still head to the lunar surface</a>.
