    <h1>Federal Judge Orders Legal Funds for Migrant Children to Be Restored</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Under a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/7311/text" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">law combating human trafficking</a>, which the nonprofit groups argued the government had violated, the government must, to the “greatest extent practicable,” provide legal representation to minors.</p><p>Children represented by the nonprofits, according to the groups’ complaint, have arrived in the United States to flee violence, poverty and other dangers. Many of them are from Central America. Most do not speak English or have the means to hire a lawyer.</p><p>Nearly two-thirds of unaccompanied children had representation when they appeared in U.S. courts during the 2024 fiscal year, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/media/1344931/dl?inline" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to official data</a>. Children who have lawyers <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/852516/dl?inline=" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attend their hearings 95 percent of the time</a>, while those without representation attend only 33 percent of the time. Thousands of children in recent years who have missed their court dates have been ordered to be deported.</p><p>Since the funding was withdrawn, groups said that they had been forced to consider cutting staff to stay financially viable or to stop providing legal services to existing and future clients. The groups, the judge said on Tuesday, would likely suffer “irreparable harm” without the funding.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the care of migrant children, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The order, which came into effect on Wednesday, will expire on April 16, with both parties able to file more briefs ahead of a final decision by the court.</p></div></div>
