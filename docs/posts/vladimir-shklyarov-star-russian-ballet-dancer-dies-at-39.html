Its graduates include Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Shklyarov joined the Mariinsky directly out of school, and went on to perform in both contemporary and classical productions, including “Swan Lake,” “Don Quixote” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/arts/dance/review-an-abundance-of-giselles-with-debuts-and-farewells.html" title="">Giselle</a>.” He received multiple awards for his work, including the prestigious Léonide Massine International Prize in 2008. But the Mariinsky said that “the most precious for Vladimir” was receiving the title of an honored artist of Russia in 2020.</p><p>Information about survivors was not immediately available. In 2012, Mr. Shklyarov married another dancer, Maria Shirinkina, who also performed with the Mariinsky, according to Russian news <a href="https://www.sobaka.ru/lifestyle/design/20360" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">media</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/arts/dance/review-the-mariinsky-ballet-offers-works-honoring-its-legends.html" title="">a review of a performance</a> during the company’s 2016 tour of the United States, a New York Times critic said, “The best moment came from Maria Shirinkina, supernaturally airborne, and Mr. Shklyarov, elegant and mournful, in a cobbled together extract from ‘Giselle.’ For a little while, they suggested another world.”</p><p>A former ballerina, Irina Bartnovskaya, wrote on <a href="https://t.me/devilonpointshoes/8344" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a> that Mr. Shklyarov had been at home, on painkillers and preparing for foot surgery before his death. She said that he went out to smoke onto “a very narrow balcony” and fell five stories in “a stupid, unbearable accident.”</p><p>Her account could not be verified, but it echoed similar reports in Russian news outlets, including <a href="https://www.fontanka.ru/2024/11/16/74344148/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fontanka</a>, which quoted a Mariinsky Theater spokeswoman, Anna Kasatkina, as saying that he was on painkillers and expected to have surgery.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
