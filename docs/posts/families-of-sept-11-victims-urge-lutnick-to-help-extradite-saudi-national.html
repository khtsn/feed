And Cantor, whose offices spanned the 101st to the 105th floors of the World Trade Center’s North Tower, lost more employees than any other firm affected by the attacks.</p><p>The letter comes as Mr. Lutnick plans to accompany President Trump to Saudi Arabia this week as part of a weeklong trip to the Middle East. The families urged Mr. Lutnick to make the case that Mr. al-Bayoumi be brought to justice in any discussions about strengthening the United States’ economic partnership with the kingdom. The relatives wrote that his appointment “gives us renewed hope” to determine the full truth about the attacks and who was responsible.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“You are in a unique position to emphasize that any such partnership must begin with accountability and justice, ensuring that Omar al-Bayoumi is handed over to the United States to face justice in an American court,” read the letter, which had more than 150 signatories.</p><p>“This issue transcends politics; it is a matter of principle,” the letter continued. “It is about honoring the lives we lost, and whether the country that sent them to their tragic deaths will ever be held accountable.”</p><p>Commerce Department officials declined to comment. A person with knowledge of Mr. Lutnick’s thinking said he had seen the letter and deeply appreciated the family members’ thoughts.</p><p>Mr. Lutnick, who was serving as the firm’s chief executive at the time of the attack, lost 658 employees, including his best friend. In a social media post last year, he <a href="https://x.com/howardlutnick/status/1833816967691600379?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recounted how he was dropping his son off for his first day of kindergarten</a> when his phone kept ringing and disconnecting as his brother, Gary, tried to call to say goodbye.</p><p>Cantor Fitzgerald continued to support the families affected by the attacks, giving them $180 million. It also paid for their health care for 10 years and set up a relief fund.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“I promised to take care of all the families,” he wrote. “They became part of my family.”</p><p>There was <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/9-11-settlement-distribution-stirs-ire-among-cantor-insiders" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dissent within the firm</a> over how a settlement allocation from American Airlines over the aircraft that slammed into the World Trade Center’s North Tower, causing it to collapse, Fox Business reported. Mr. Lutnick told the company’s executives in 2014 that the money was to be largely disbursed among partners at the firm, as opposed to family members of those killed. It is unclear whether that was how the money was ultimately disbursed. Mr. Lutnick declined to comment to Fox Business for its article at the time.</p><p>For years, information about Mr. al-Bayoumi’s potential involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks was obscured.</p><p>Last summer, a trove of evidence seized by British authorities from the home of Mr. al-Bayoumi tying him to the Sept. 11 Qaeda hijackers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/nyregion/sept-11-saudi-ties.html" title="">was made public for the first time</a>.</p><p>More than a week after the attacks, British police officers raided the home of Mr. al-Bayoumi, who had met two of the Sept. 11 hijackers in Los Angeles shortly after they arrived in early 2000. Among the items the officers seized was a pad on which Mr. al-Bayoumi had sketched an airplane in blue ink, above which he had written a mathematical equation.</p><p>The British authorities turned the material over to the F.B.I. for its investigation of the attacks. But it remains unclear what happened to the drawing after that. It was not shared with the 9/11 Commission, a bipartisan group of lawmakers and experts responsible for writing the definitive account of the attacks. In its 2004 report, the commission called Mr. al-Bayoumi “an unlikely candidate for clandestine involvement with Islamic extremists.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>None of the new evidence from Mr. al-Bayoumi’s home conclusively proved that the Saudi government enabled the attacks, but it adds to a growing circumstantial case.</p><p>The families cited a report broadcast on “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bayoumi-september-11-evidence-60-minutes/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">60 Minutes” last month,</a> revealing that Mr. al-Bayoumi filmed the Capitol before the attacks.</p><p>In the letter, the families pointed out that such information had been in the F.B.I.’s hands weeks after the attack but was withheld from the American public and the Sept. 11 commission for years.</p><p>“That betrayal is staggering,” the letter said. “But now we have an opportunity for a fresh start.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Erica L.
