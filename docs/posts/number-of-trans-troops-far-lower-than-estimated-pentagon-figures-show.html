Previous estimates usually put the number of trans troops at about 15,000.</p><p>The Trump administration has implemented new policies that bar trans troops from serving, citing disruption in the ranks and the cost of medical care as primary reasons. President Trump has characterized the cost of providing care as “tremendous.” And in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-transgender-troops.html" title="">an executive order</a> last month, the administration asserted that being transgender “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful and disciplined lifestyle.”</p><p>The military also released for the first time figures on the cost of providing gender-affirming medical care for trans troops. They show that since 2015, when trans troops were first allowed to serve openly, the military has spent $52 million on their care.<span>   </span>including psychotherapy, hormone therapy and surgery, or about $9,000 per trans service member. The total is a fraction of the $17 billion annual budget for the Defense Department’s health agency. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The Defense Department data shows that about half of the troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria required no medical care at all. About a quarter required surgery. </p><p>For years, the military insisted that it had no way of tracking figures related to transgender troops. The Pentagon released the numbers after a federal judge ordered the Defense Department on Thursday to provide data on trans service members, ruling in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/politics/5-transgender-service-members-sue-trump-over-military-ban.html" title="">a lawsuit</a> filed by a group of trans service members who challenged the Trump policies barring them. </p></div></div></section></article></div>
