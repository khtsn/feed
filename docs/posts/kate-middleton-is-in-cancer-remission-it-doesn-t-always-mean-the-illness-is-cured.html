But what does it mean to be in remission from cancer?</p><p>Doctors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/health/kate-middleton-cancer-chemotherapy.html" title="">discovered her cancer</a> unexpectedly last March when she had abdominal surgery. She has not revealed the type of cancer she has, nor how advanced it was when it was discovered.</p><p>But she did say she had chemotherapy, which she said had been completed in September. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/europe/kate-middleton-cancer-remission.html" title="">told</a> the British news agency PA Media that she had a port, a small device that is implanted under the skin and attached to a catheter that goes into a large vein. It allows medicines like chemotherapy drugs to be delivered directly to veins in the chest, avoiding needle sticks.</p><p>Catherine told PA Media that chemotherapy was “really tough.”</p><p>“It is a relief to now be in remission and I remain focused on recovery,” she wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DE0BZyJN1kt/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Instagram</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Her announcement “certainly is good news and is reassuring,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, associate chief of the division of gastrointestinal oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</p><p>But cancer experts like Dr. Ng say that the meaning of remission in a patient can vary.</p><p>In general, when doctors and patients talk about remission, they mean there is no evidence of cancer in blood tests or scans.</p><p>The problem is that a complete remission does not mean the cancer is gone. Even when a cancer is “cured” — defined as no evidence of cancer for five years — it may not be vanquished.</p><p>That makes life emotionally difficult for patients, who have to have frequent visits with oncologists for physical exams, blood tests and imaging.</p><p>“It’s really scary,” Dr. Ng said. “The amount of uncertainty is very very hard,” she added.</p><p>But that ongoing surveillance is necessary, despite the toll it takes on patients.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Different cancers have different propensities of returning or not returning,” said Dr. Elena Ratner, a gynecologic oncologist at the Yale Cancer Center.</p><p>As many as 75 to 80 percent of ovarian cancers, she noted, can come back in an average of 14 to 16 months after a remission, depending on the stage the cancer had reached when it was found and on the cancer’s biology.</p><p>“Once the cancer returns, it becomes a chronic disease,” Dr. Ratner said. She tells her patients: “You will live with this cancer. You will be on and off chemotherapy for the rest of your life.”</p><p>Dr. Ratner’s gynecological cancer patients have to come back every three months for CT scans to keep an eye out for evidence that the cancer has returned.</p><p>“The women live CT scan to CT scan,” she said. “They say that for two and a half months, they have a wonderful life, but then, in time for the next CT scan, the fear returns.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“It costs them — it costs them a lot,” she said.</p><p>“It’s awful, yet I am amazed every day by their strength,” she said of her patients.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Gina Kolata reports on diseases and treatments, how treatments are discovered and tested, and how they affect people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata">More about Gina Kolata</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
