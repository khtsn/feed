The European Kid amassed millions of followers and billions of views on TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>New York is awash in influencers strip-mining the city’s restaurants, nightclubs and subway cars for social media content. Some manage to reach the heights of internet fame by doing nothing more than using the city as a scenic backdrop to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA8-a_WPsG6/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ask strangers</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/realestate/caleb-simpson-apartments-new-york.html" title="">how much they pay in rent</a> or to quiz couples <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meetcutesnyc/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about how they met</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But Mr. Yeager, who has slicked-back hair, limbs like tree branches and piercing blue eyes, has tapped into something different.</p><p>His posts have landed at a moment when the incoming president has tapped a half-dozen billionaires for top government posts and society’s age-old fascination with wealth has shifted. Instead of gawking at the gold-plated interiors of “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” or “MTV Cribs,” viewers are guffawing at the badly behaved billionaire Roy family on “Succession,” the objectionable luxury vacationers on “White Lotus” and the elites in almost any recent TV mini-series starring Nicole Kidman.</p><p>The popularity of hate-watching the rich has created a lucrative genre for Hollywood — and for Mr. Yeager. He is now striking deals with luxury brands that sponsor his shticks, being paid anywhere from $15,000 to $30,000 to collaborate on posts, he said.</p><p>Mr. Yeager created The European Kid to mock the rich by pretending to be one of them — and now he’s getting rich doing it. How much has he earned? He says he isn’t counting. But there are signs the gig is paying off.</p><p>“I recognize how preposterous it is,” he said, relaxing in the rooftop lounge of his Manhattan apartment building, which is equipped with a bowling alley, indoor golf simulator and cold-plunge pool.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-76f234af">‘Rich people problems’</h2><p><em>A rich kid </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theeuropeankid/video/7358201243694615851" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>stands in a luxury clothing store</em></a><em> holding a coffee without a lid and gets into a fight with a salesman who is worried he will spill.</em></p><p><em>“What’s your problem? Do you realize what kind of client I am?” the rich kid asks. “I can buy your whole little store.”</em></p><p>Mr. Yeager did not start out as a member of the superrich, but he was surrounded by them growing up in Belgium. His father is an American marketing consultant turned high school teacher and his mother is Greek and works in politics; the family was “middle-class comfortable,” his father said, but well off enough to afford a $45,000-a-year international school in Brussels that was attended by the children of C.E.O.s, government ministers, diplomats and Qatari royalty. Many of Mr. Yeager’s classmates stood to inherit millions.</p><p>Mr. Yeager arrived at college with a love for acting and a deep curiosity about how internet content spreads. He made music and uploaded it to Spotify, but that didn’t seem to resonate. He posted travel videos, but they didn’t get many clicks. Bored during the pandemic, he created an online character that satirized mafia life, but it was taken down by TikTok, which thought it was real. By the time he got the account up and running again, he had lost interest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>In 2022, he enrolled in summer courses and stayed with a college friend who was boarding at the Fairmont Copley Plaza, a luxury Boston hotel that boasts of “lavish guest rooms” and “beautifully plush linens.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Yeager’s video foils often play along, but passers-by are not in on the joke.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Aris Yeager</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Just to get a sense of how rich kids are, he wasn’t even staying in his apartment anymore,” Mr. Yeager said. “His parents got him a hotel room to stay, which is ridiculous.”</p><p>Late one evening as the two men snacked and watched “Avatar,” Mr. Yeager began acting out a scene he had witnessed of another wealthy friend begging his father for $10,000 over the phone. His roommate found it hilarious and discreetly filmed the episode.</p><p>“I saw it the next day and thought that was kind of funny,” Mr. Yeager said. “I posted it.”</p><p>The video hurtled across the internet, racking up more than 10 million views and thousands of comments. Many viewers thought it was real and were disgusted. One called it “the most gross thing I’ve seen.”</p><p>“I love rich people problems,” another commenter said. “They live in a completely different world.”</p><p>Audiences have devoured plots that point out the absurdities of wealth since the days of Aristophanes, but Mr. Yeager still marvels at how this particular video took off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“It was just making fun of friends,” Mr. Yeager said. “I basically became a meme about a rich kid overnight.”</p><p>He ran with it, reaching back in his memory to the spoiled behavior of his classmates in Brussels and taking mental notes every time he spotted new obnoxiousness. His life was fertile terrain.</p><p>“I just know exactly how to do this character, because obviously my whole life I’ve grown up in an environment surrounded by very pretentious, affluent kids who act a certain way,” he said. “It’s almost like I instantly know all the humor.”</p><p>The French accent Mr. Yeager adopts for the videos (he can speak French and four other languages but in real life has an American accent) adds to the snobbishness of his character. Part of the fun of his posts comes from the response of his foils, who are often recognizable figures.</p><p><em>A rich kid </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzM5949sD7m/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>loses his mind</em></a><em> when he shows up for dinner at </em><a href="https://www.luciennyc.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Lucien</em></a><em>, a high-end French bistro in the East Village where it is notoriously difficult to get a table.

It turned out the scion was a fan.</p><p>“I text his son and say, ‘I just saw your boat. It’s sick,’” Mr. Yeager said, recounting the interaction. “He responds and says, ‘You’re welcome to come on it in St. Tropez.’”</p><p>He kept scrolling through his followers, showing them to his wealthy friends, who pointed out other members of the one percent.
