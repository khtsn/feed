Then a militia member shot him in the head and sneeringly asked her what she thought of that.</p><p>The militia tried to systematically kill all the males over 10, Maryam said, and also killed some younger ones. A 1-day-old boy was thrown to the ground and killed, and one male infant was thrown into a pond to drown, she said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The gunmen then rounded up the women and girls in a corral to rape, she added. “They raped many, many girls,” she recalled. One man tried to rape Maryam, she said, and when he failed he beat her. She was pregnant and suffered a miscarriage.</p><p>“You’re slaves,” Maryam quoted the militia members as saying. “There is no place for you Black people in Sudan.” So Maryam fled to neighboring Chad and is one of more than 10 million Sudanese who have been forcibly displaced since a civil war began last year in the country and ignited pogroms against Black African ethnic groups like hers.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Maryam Suleiman wept as she recounted how a militia in Sudan attacked her village and killed her five brothers.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicholas Kristof</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The atrocities underway near here are an echo of the Darfur genocide of two decades ago, with the additional complication of famine. But there’s a crucial difference: At that time, world leaders, celebrities and university students vigorously protested the slaughter and joined forces to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Today, in contrast, the world is distracted and silent. So the impunity is allowing violence to go unchecked, which, in turn, is producing what may become the worst famine in half a century or more.</p><p>“It’s beyond anything we’ve ever seen,” Cindy McCain, the executive director of the United Nations World Food Program, told me. “It’s catastrophic.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“Unless,” she added, “we can get our job done.”</p><p>World leaders will convene next week in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly, but they have been mostly indifferent and are unlikely to get the job done. What’s needed is far greater pressure to end the civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the rival Arab militia, while pushing the warring parties to allow humanitarian access. All sides in the war are behaving irresponsibly, so more than half the people of Sudan — <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/sudan-facing-unprecedented-hunger-catastrophe-say-un-agency-chiefs#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2025.6%20million,feed%20themselves%20and%20their%20families" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25 million people</a> — have become acutely malnourished already. A famine was formally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/opinion/famine-darfur-civil-war.html" title="">declared</a> in one area in Sudan in the summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-7"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/autossell/KristofSudanThumnbailA/KristofSudanThumnbailA-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p><div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">This is what I witnessed — and it shattered me.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Timmo Gaasbeek, a disaster expert who has <a href="https://www.clingendael.org/publication/sudan-hunger-death" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modeled the crisis</a> for <a href="https://www.clingendael.org/about-us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a research institute</a> in the Netherlands, told me that he foresees 13 million people starving to death in Sudan by October 2025, with a margin of error of two million. Such a toll would make this one of the worst famines in world history and the worst since <a href="https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/chinas-great-leap-forward/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the great Chinese famine of 65 years ago</a>. By way of contrast, the famous Ukraine famine of the 1930s killed perhaps <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/chgs/holocaust-genocide-education/resource-guides/holodomor#:~:text=Around%203.9%20million%20Ukrainians%20died,North%20Carolina%2DChapel%20Hill)." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four million</a> people, although estimates vary.</p><p>I can’t verify that a cataclysm of that level is approaching. Warring parties blocked me from entering Sudanese areas they controlled, so I reported along the Chad-Sudan border. Arriving refugees described starvation but not yet mass mortality from malnutrition.</p><p>All I can say is that whether or not a cataclysmic famine is probable, it is a significant risk. Those in danger are people like Thuraya Muhammad, a slight 17-year-old orphan who told me how her world unraveled when the Rapid Support Forces, the same group that killed Maryam’s five brothers, attacked her village and began burning homes and shooting men and boys.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>“So many men were killed, like grains of sand,” she told me.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>When Thuraya Muhammad, an orphan because of Sudan’s war, doesn’t have enough food to feed her younger sister and brother, she gives them water to fill their stomachs.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Nicholas Kristof</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>After slaughtering the men in Thuraya’s village, the militia raped many women and girls, she said. Thuraya’s cousin, a woman of 20, was among those kidnapped by the militia and hasn’t been seen since, she added.</p><p>Thuraya’s father was murdered by the militia and her mother had died earlier, so at 16 she was now the head of the household. She led her younger brother and two younger sisters to safety by walking to the Chadian border town of Adré. Gunmen tried to rob them several times, but the family had nothing left to steal.</p><p>Now in a refugee camp in Chad, Thuraya works to feed her siblings. Like other refugees, she gets a monthly food allotment from the World Food Program that helps but is insufficient. She supports her family by seeking day jobs washing clothes or cleaning houses (for about 25 cents a day). When she finds work, she and her siblings eat; if not, they may go hungry.</p><p>When I dropped by their hut, Thuraya had been unable to find work that day. A friendly neighbor had given her a cup of coffee, but she hadn’t eaten anything since the previous day — and there was no prospect of dinner, either. If there is no food, Thuraya told me, she serves water to her siblings in place of dinner.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>She wept.</p><p>Thuraya wasn’t crying from her own pangs of hunger. Rather, tears tumbled silently down her cheeks out of shame at her inability to feed her brother and sisters.</p><p>“When there isn’t enough food, I give it to my sisters and brother,” she told me, and her younger sister Fatima confirmed that. “I go hungry, or else my neighbors may call me over to eat with them.”</p><p>“I’d rather my sisters and brother eat, because they cry when they go hungry,” she said. “And I can’t bear to hear them cry.”</p><p>Fatima resists the favoritism and tries to give her sister back some food. But Thuraya won’t take it and goes out, telling her brother and sisters to eat while she finds something for herself. They all know that in a refugee camp of about 200,000 hungry people, she will find nothing.</p><p>I’m hoping that Thuraya’s fortitude might inspire President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, along with world leaders gathering at the United Nations, to summon a similar resolve to tackle slaughter and starvation in Sudan. Donor nations have contributed less than half the sum needed by U.N. agencies to ease Sudan’s food crisis, and they have not insisted forcefully on either providing humanitarian access or on cutting off <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/09/fanning-flames" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the flow of weapons</a> that sustains the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Biden, who 20 years ago savaged President George W. Bush for not doing enough to stop the Darfur genocide, has provided aid and appointed a special envoy to push for peace talks but has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/17/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-sudan/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> little about the current crisis. An American partner, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/world/europe/sudan-war-crimes-un.html" title="">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/uae-sending-weapons-sudan-via-110000762.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supplies weapons</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/world/africa/sudan-war-united-arab-emirates-chad.html" title="">to the militia</a> that slaughtered and raped Thuraya’s neighbors, yet Biden has not publicly demanded that the Emirates cut off that support for killers and rapists.</p><p>The upshot of this neglect is the risk not only of a horrendous famine but also of endless war, Sudan’s fragmentation, enormous refugee flows and instability across the region.</p><p>So as world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly tuck into fine banquets next week to celebrate their humanitarianism, may they be awakened by thoughts of an orphan of Darfur who ignores her own hunger and divides scraps of bread among her brother and sisters.</p><p>Thuraya has no reason to feel ashamed that her siblings are hungry; the shame belongs to those who are powerful, well fed and blind.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-17"><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="opreaders-kristof-sudan" data-id="100000009705000" data-source-id="100000009705000"><div data-sourceid="100000009705000" id="embed-id-100000009705000">
