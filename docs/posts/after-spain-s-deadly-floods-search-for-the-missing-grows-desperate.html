Others were still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/world/europe/spain-floods-valencia-rain.html" title="">waiting for news</a>, caught between grief and hope that a missing relative could still be alive somewhere in the muck.</p><p>A full week after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/climate/spain-valencia-floods.html" title="">catastrophic rains</a>, the government has not published an official figure of the number of missing, even as it approved a major relief package on Tuesday of 10.6 billion euros, or $11.6 billion.</p><p>“We want to be very cautious,” Óscar Puente, the Spanish transport minister, said in a radio interview on Monday. </p><p>The relief package includes payments of up to about $66,000 to people whose homes were damaged and additional aid for people with serious injuries. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“There are still missing people to be found, and more companies, businesses and families affected,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said on Tuesday. “That is why we must continue working.”</p><p>Many families, though, are not waiting for the government as they search for missing relatives.</p><p>Social media pages have lit up with pictures of the disappeared. One <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1WbP4DX7LKE4s_b7DqURdeDRu9GFi51c&amp;ll=39.48713567661697%2C-0.3798128440213966&amp;z=12" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crowdsourced map</a> of the area around Valencia, the hardest-hit area in eastern Spain, lists their last-known locations. Another collects <a href="https://ayudaterreta.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">real-time information</a> about the things residents need most urgently.</p><p>“We had to act quickly, because people were without basic resources,” said Jorge Sáiz, 32, who built the aid map with his wife, Sandra Navarro, 31.</p><p>Last week, a social media account began sharing photos and information about missing people. The page is called “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/danadesaparecidos?igsh=MTM4cDdtcm95Y2QzdA%3D%3D" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DANA Desaparecidos</a>,” which roughly translates to “Missing From the Storm.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB-D5iRIY8-/?img_index=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of about 100 posts</a>, a man with a round face smiles, his eyes crinkling above stubbly cheeks. His name is Luciano Bravo Morales.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Bravo, 58, was walking in Catarroja, a town near the city of Valencia, when the floodwaters began to rise the night of Oct. 29, said Alexia Romero, his niece, in a phone call.</p><p>He called his family and climbed on top of a car, she said. Then, he grabbed the awning of a bar. “The last thing he said was, ‘The water is rising too much, the water is going to take me away,’ ” said Ms. Romero, 32.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Her family called a hotline that had been set up by the local government and filed an official missing person’s report. They also shared his photograph on social media.</p><p>The difference in the responses shocked them, she said. No officials have called, she said, but the people running the social media pages have reached out to ask if they need help.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“I know that the streets need to be cleaned but — with all due respect — I think they should prioritize searching for missing persons,” Ms. Romero said. “The life of a person is more important than cleaning the lower parts of a house.”</p><p>After days of waiting for news, her family just wants to know what happened to Mr. Bravo.</p><p>“I don’t know how much more time we have left,” she said. “It’s been a week, we’re expecting the worst, but the sooner we can find out, the better.”</p><p>The government plans to publish a provisional count of the missing soon, Nieves Goicoechea, communications director for the Spanish Interior Ministry, said in a phone interview.</p><p>But the reports are complicated. Several people may have called to report the same person, Mr. Puente said. That could lead to an overcount.</p><p>There could also be an undercount. People can only file an official report in person, which some may not yet have been able to do. Many police stations have also been damaged or destroyed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“The government cannot declare a person missing through a phone call,” Ms. Goicoechea said. “There is transparency, but our transparency must be responsible.”</p><p>As the government tries to get organized, families grow angrier.</p><p>Samuel Ruiz, 28, is still looking for his father, Francisco Ruiz Martínez. He said that Mr. Ruiz Martínez, 64, had been driving his nephews near Montserrat, another town near Valencia, when the car got caught in the floods.</p><p>Mr. Ruiz Martínez broke the window to get the boys — who are 5 and 10 — safely to its roof. But when he tried to climb up himself, his son said, he slipped.</p><p>“The water took him away,” Mr. Ruiz said in a phone interview. “He disappeared.”</p><p>The family also called the hotline and reported his disappearance. They filed an in-person report and gave a DNA sample. They also have not yet received any official information. “The response of the authorities has been lamentable,” Mr. Ruiz said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>But <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB3aB30tU9i/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people on social media</a>, he added, have been reposting his father’s picture, trying to spread the word. “The most efficient response came from the volunteers and all the neighbors in the area,” he said. </p><p>As families worry and pray, some are repeating a phrase that has <a href="https://www.trendencias.com/general/solo-pueblo-salva-al-pueblo-donde-viene-precioso-lema-nacido-dana-valencia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">become</a> something of a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/cx2800ev9e9o" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">motto</a>: “Solo el pueblo salva al pueblo,” or “Only the people save the people.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
