Trump was last president of the United States, the wealthy monarchies of the Persian Gulf had a mostly harmonious relationship with his administration. As Mr. Trump prepares to return to the White House, the leaders of those Gulf countries have generally welcomed him back.</p><p>But this time around, the Gulf states and Mr. Trump appear to be diverging on several cornerstone issues, like Israel and Iran. Differences over energy policies could also be a source of friction.</p><p>It is unlikely that there will be major tensions or ruptures with U.S. allies in the Gulf. But Mr. Trump will be encountering a region that has seen drastic shifts since Israel launched its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/israel-hamas-gaza" title="">war on Gaza</a> in response to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/issue/world/2024/10/21/the-oct-7-attacks" title="">Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7, 2023</a>, in which the Israeli authorities say about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage.</p><p>The war in Gaza, in which at least 45,000 people have been killed, according to health officials in the enclave, has rippled across the region. In Lebanon, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been battered by more than a year of fighting against Israel. And in Syria, rebels <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/world/middleeast/assad-regime-syria-final-days.html" title="">toppled the regime</a> of Bashar al-Assad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Now, while Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/us/politics/trump-israel-middle-east.html" title="">is filling his cabinet</a> with Iran hawks and staunch defenders of Israel, Gulf leaders have publicly been urging a softer stance on Iran and a tougher line on Israel.</p><p>They have also been calling on the United States to stay engaged with the region.</p><p>For now, the Trump administration has appeared eager to engage with the Gulf powerhouses of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>In December, Mr. Trump’s pick as his envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in the Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi, where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/eric-trump-cryptocurrency-conference.html" title="">attended a Bitcoin conference</a> along with Eric Trump, the president-elect’s son.

That mission was to bring “PEACE, with capital letters,” he wrote.</p><p>During his first term, Mr. Trump’s administration brokered the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/politics/trump-israel-peace-emirates-bahrain.html" title="">Abraham Accords</a> that saw several Arab countries establishing ties with Israel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Speaking at an Arab League summit in Riyadh recently, Prince Mohammed for the first time called the Israeli military campaign in Gaza <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/video/f04wU9Zf/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a “genocide.”</a></p><p>Just before the war in Gaza erupted in October 2023, Saudi Arabia appeared to be on the verge of forging diplomatic relations with Israel without fulfilling its longstanding precondition for doing so — the establishment of a Palestinian state. Such a deal would have reshaped the Middle East.</p><p>Under one plan, Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in exchange for stronger defense ties with the United States and American support for a civilian nuclear program in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>But recent statements by Prince Mohammed suggest that any deals are a long way off.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Walking amid the rubble of destroyed buildings in central Gaza in December.

That is still a distant prospect given strong opposition to such a state within the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I think that the crown prince wanted to make his position clear and beyond any shadow of a doubt,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi businessman who is close to the kingdom’s ruling family.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates — a signatory to the Abraham Accords — has also signaled a hardened stance toward Israel.</p><p>The U.A.E. foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, told his Israeli counterpart last week that the Emirates would “spare no effort supporting Palestinians.”</p><p>Despite Saudi Arabia’s public stance on the status of a normalization deal, U.S. diplomats have indicated that the kingdom may be privately open to advancing one under a second Trump presidency — contingent upon a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and a tangible commitment by Israel toward a path to Palestinian statehood.</p><p>“All of that is ready to go if the opportunity presents itself with a cease-fire in Gaza as well as understandings on a pathway forward for the Palestinians,” the departing U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said on Wednesday. “So, there’s tremendous opportunity there.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><h2 id="link-ef85e2a">Détente With Iran?</h2><p>During Mr. Trump’s first term, both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates championed his administration’s hawkish stance on Iran, seeing Tehran as a dangerous rival in the region.</p><p>They cheered when Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html" title="">withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran</a> and hailed his decision to authorize the assassination of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/obituaries/qassem-soleimani-dead.html" title="">Qassim Suleimani</a>, the general who directed Iran’s militias and proxy forces around the Middle East, in January 2020.</p><p>But the dynamics of the region have changed since Mr. Trump’s first term.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran reached <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/11/us/politics/saudi-arabia-iran-china-biden.html" title="">an accord</a> in March 2023 that reduced tensions in the Persian Gulf and opened the door to high-level diplomatic contacts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A pro-Hezbollah billboard near a taxi station in Tehran.

Many former officials, pundits and newspaper editorials in Iran have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/world/middleeast/iran-trump-election-deal.html" title="">openly called for the government to engage with Mr. Trump</a>. </p><p>So far, Mr. Trump, too, appears open at least in charting a different course from the “maximum pressure” campaign of his first term.
