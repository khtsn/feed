		<p>Former NRG Head Coach <span data-ref-id="0">Chet		&#34;<a href="https://www.vlr.gg/player/4012/chet">Chet</a>&#34;
		Singh</span> has been suspended from professional play until the end of Masters Bangkok on March 3, 2025, for violating the Riot Games Global Esports Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>According to Riot&#39;s <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-US/news/competitive-ruling-chetan-chet-singh" target="_blank">competitive ruling</a>, Chet breached provision 3.21, Confidential Information, by &#34;broadcasting VoDs whose access was contingent on current status as head coach of a VCT team. His access to the content was unauthorized, and its distribution on July 31, 2024, constituted a breach of proprietary information. He did not secure permission from Riot Games, NRG, and the other teams involved prior to broadcasting publicly inaccessible VoDs and communications to his personal channels.&#34; Following section 4.10, Team Sanctions and the Role of Team Leadership, a suspension was imposed, weighing the severity and circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>Following the ruling&#39;s release, Chet <a href="https://x.com/chetsingh/status/1845956582456414389" target="_blank">announced</a> that he would focus on content creation until the suspension was lifted in early March.</p>
