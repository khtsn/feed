Why was the listening party, as Ye calls his shows, taking place not in Beijing or Shanghai, but in Hainan, an obscure island province? </p><p>Under a <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23%E4%BE%83%E7%88%B7%E6%B5%B7%E5%8F%A3%E4%B8%93%E8%BE%91%E8%AF%95%E5%90%AC%E4%BC%9A%E8%BF%87%E5%AE%A1%23" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trending hashtag</a> on the social media site Weibo on the subject, one popular comment read simply “How?” alongside an exploding-head emoji.</p><p>The answer may lie in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/business/china-economy-consumption.html" title="">China’s struggling economy</a>. Since China reopened its borders after three years of coronavirus lockdowns, the government has been trying to stimulate consumer spending and promote tourism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Vigorously introducing new types of performances desired by young people, and concerts from international singers with super internet traffic, is the outline for future high-quality development,” the government of Haikou, the city hosting the listening party, posted on its <a href="http://lwj.haikou.gov.cn/ywdt/ly/lyzx/202409/t1377736.shtml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> on Thursday. </p><p>But it is unclear whether the appearance by Ye — who would be perhaps the highest-profile Western artist to perform in mainland China since the pandemic — is part of a broader loosening or an exception.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, the number of big-name foreign entertainers visiting China <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/china-live-music-scene-focus-domestic-acts-zero-covid-eases/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had been falling</a> as the authorities tightened controls on speech. Acts such as Bon Jovi and Maroon 5 had shows abruptly canceled, leading to speculation that band members’ expressions of support for causes like Tibetan independence were to blame. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/world/asia/justin-bieber-china-tour.html" title="">Justin Bieber was barred from China</a> in 2017 over what the Beijing city government, without specifying, called “bad behavior.”</p><p>Ye might have seemed like a no-go too. The Chinese authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyle/china-takes-aim-at-hip-hop-saying-low-taste-content-must-stop-idUSKBN1FB12V/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declared war on hip-hop</a> in 2018, with the state news media saying that artists who insulted women and promoted drug use “don’t deserve a stage.”</p><p>But in Ye’s case, objections to hip-hop may have been outweighed by the potential payoff — especially for Hainan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>For years, the Chinese government has sought to turn Hainan, an island roughly the size of Maryland or Belgium,<span>  </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/business/china-hong-kong-hainan-island.html" title="">into an international commercial hub</a>. It offers visa-free entry and duty-free shopping, and has pledged to attract more world-class cultural events.</p><p><a href="https://jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-sheng-zou/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sheng Zou</a>, a media scholar at Hong Kong Baptist University, said enforcement of censorship was capricious. “When it comes to Ye, I guess his celebrity status may outweigh his identity as a hip-hop artist.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Consumers lining up to buy the newly released Adidas Yeezy, a collaboration between Adidas and Kanye West, in Taiyuan city, China, in 2019.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Imaginechina, via Alamy</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>For Ricardo Shi, 25, an employee of a tech company in Shenzhen, the chance to see Ye was worth spending $700 on plane tickets for a two-day trip to Haikou. “It’s been so long since he last came to China,” he said. (Ye performed in Beijing and Shanghai in 2008.) “It’s a rare opportunity to be there in person.”</p><p>Ye, who is touring to promote “Vultures,” his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/arts/music/kanye-west-ye-vultures-college-dropout.html" title="">new album</a> series with the singer Ty Dolla Sign, has praised China. He <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2020/07/08/kanye-west-says-hes-done-with-trump-opens-up-about-white-house-bid-damaging-biden-and-everything-in-between/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Forbes</a> in 2020 that the country “changed my life.” He lived in the city of Nanjing as a fifth grader, when his mother was teaching English there.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>And issues that have led Western brands to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/business/adidas-kanye-west-yeezy-takeaways.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">cut off collaborations</a> with Ye and alienated many American fans, like his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/26/arts/music/kanye-west-apology-antisemitism.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">antisemitic</a> and homophobic comments, are of less concern to Chinese officials.</p><p>Still, no artist can escape political scrutiny altogether.</p><p>A photo circulating on Chinese social media showed officials gathered around a conference table, before a screen that read: “Haikou Municipal Bureau of Tourism, Culture, Radio, Television and Sports ‘Kanye West World Tour Audiovisual Concert’ Risk Assessment Meeting.”</p><p>Reached by telephone, an employee at the bureau could not confirm the photo’s authenticity, but said that similar meetings were routine before large-scale events.</p><p>“These things, in my opinion, are a kind of test,” the employee, who gave her surname, Wang, said of the Ye event. “In the future there will be more foreigners coming to Hainan for similar concerts. As long as they provide positive energy, we’ll do it.”</p><p>No one has announced what songs Ye will play. Set lists must be preapproved by censors. </p><p>A week before officials announced Ye’s Hainan stop, a listening party planned for Taiwan was <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/5923198" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abruptly canceled</a>. The Taiwan organizers cited “unforeseen circumstances.” It is unclear whether the cancellation was related to Ye’s show in China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>A publicist who has worked with Ye on past listening parties did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A Chinese fan wearing a mask of Ye during a “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” screening in Beijing in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jade Gao/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Even after Ye passed the Chinese censors, some complained that he should not have. A string of submissions to Haikou’s public complaints website objected to his lyrics and personal behavior, with one user declaring them “inconsistent with our country’s cultural and social values.”</p><p>Some Ye supporters suggested that those complaints were from disgruntled Taylor Swift fans. Ms. Swift, with whom Ye has a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/taylor-swift-kanye-west-kim-kardashian-drama.html" title="">long and well-documented feud</a>, has yet to announce any China dates for her Eras tour. (Several Shanghai government advisers recently called on the city to loosen its concert approval processes, citing performers like Ms. Swift, who they said were like “<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3271037/taylor-swift-walking-gdp-shanghai-urged-shake-curbs-foreign-stars" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">walking G.D.P.</a>”)</p><p>The anti-Ye comments have since disappeared from the government website.</p><p>Siyi Zhao<!-- --> and <!-- -->Claire Fu<!-- --> contributed research. <!-- -->Julia Jacobs<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Vivian Wang is a China correspondent based in Beijing, where she writes about how the country’s global rise and ambitions are shaping the daily lives of its people.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/vivian-wang">More about Vivian Wang</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/maroon-5">Maroon 5</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><p><span><div><svg aria-hidden="true" width="21" height="18" viewBox="0 0 21 18"><path d="m14.52 17.831-5.715-4.545H2.4a1.468 1.468 0 0 1-1.468-1.469V1.894A1.471 1.471 0 0 1 2.4.405h16.583a1.469 1.469 0 0 1 1.469 1.469v9.923a1.469 1.469 0 0 1-1.47 1.47H14.58l-.06 4.564ZM2.4 1.645a.228.228 0 0 0-.228.229v9.923a.228.228 0 0 0 .228.229h6.811l4.06 3.235v-3.235h5.652a.228.228 0 0 0 .229-.229V1.874a.228.228 0 0 0-.229-.229H2.4Z" fill="#121212" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg><p><span><a href="https://www.hltv.org/2024/09/15/world/asia/ye-kanye-west-china.html">+</a></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div>
