Less than a year ago, he reached a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/meta-texas-privacy-settlement.html" title="">$1.4 billion settlement with Meta</a>, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, over allegations it had illegally tagged users’ faces on its site.</p><p>Google’s settlement is the latest legal setback for the tech giant. Over the past two years, Google has lost a string of antitrust cases after being found to have a monopoly over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/technology/epic-games-google-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">its app store</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/technology/google-ad-tech-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">search engine</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html" title="">advertising technology</a>. It has spent the past three weeks in the search case trying to fend off a U.S. government request to break up its business.</p><p>“Big Tech is not above the law,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement.</p><p>José Castañeda, a Google spokesman, said the company had already changed its product policies. “This settles a raft of old claims, many of which have already been resolved elsewhere,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Privacy issues have become a major source of tension between tech giants and regulators in recent years. In the absence of a federal privacy law, states such as Texas and Washington have passed laws to curb the collection of facial, voice and other biometric data.</p><p>Google and Meta have been the highest-profile companies challenged under those laws. Texas’ law, called <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/file-consumer-complaint/consumer-privacy-rights/biometric-identifier-act" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier</a>, requires companies to ask permission before using features like facial or voice recognition technologies. The law allows the state to impose damages of up to $25,000 per violation.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/20/technology/texas-google-privacy-lawsuit.html" title="">lawsuit filed under that law</a> focused on the Google Photos app, which allowed people to search for photos of a particular person; Google’s Next camera, which could send alerts when it recognized visitors at a door; and Google Assistant, a virtual assistant that could learn up to six users’ voices and answer their questions.</p><p>Mr. Paxton <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-sues-google-deceptively-tracking-users-location-without-consent" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a separate lawsuit</a> that accused Google of misleading Texans by tracking their personal location data, even after they thought they had disabled that feature. He added a complaint to that suit alleging that Google’s private browsing setting, which it called Incognito mode, wasn’t actually private. Those cases were brought under Texas’ Deceptive Trade Practices Act.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Tripp Mickle reports on Apple and Silicon Valley for The Times and is based in San Francisco.
