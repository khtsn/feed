Of particular interest to the F.T.C. is the way that Microsoft bundles its cloud computing offerings with office and security products, they added, alongside the company’s growing power in the artificial intelligence space.</p><p>The inquiry signals an intensifying focus on the power of the biggest tech companies over the way people consume information, communicate and shop online. Already, the F.T.C. has sued Amazon and Meta, accusing them of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/ftc-amazon.html" title="">anticompetitive behavior and stifling rivals.</a> The Justice Department has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/google-antitrust-case-lawsuit.html" title="">sued Google over its dominance</a> in advertising technology, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/technology/apple-doj-lawsuit-antitrust.html" title="">Apple for making it difficult</a> for consumers to leave its tightly knit universe of devices and software.</p><p>Microsoft, one of the most valuable companies in the world with a disparate business that includes its Windows operating software, social media platform LinkedIn and video game platform Xbox, had so far largely escaped the recent ramp up in antitrust scrutiny. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Microsoft and the F.T.C. declined to comment.
