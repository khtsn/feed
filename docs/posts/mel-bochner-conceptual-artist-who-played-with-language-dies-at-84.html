    <h1>Mel Bochner, Conceptual Artist Who Played With Language, Dies at 84</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Mel Bochner, an artist who produced heady and often witty work in a multitude of mediums, exploring the boundaries of art — and the power of language — in drawing, painting, photography, sculpture, printmaking, books, installations and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/cmtoday/issues/august-2005-issue/feature-stories/the-kraus-campo/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public art</a>, died on Feb. 12 in Manhattan. He was 84.</p><p>His death, in a hospital, was from complications of a fall, Lizbeth Marano, his wife, said.</p><p>In 1966, Mr. Bochner (pronounced BOK-ner) was in his 20s, living in a cold-water flat in the East 70s in Manhattan, writing mini art reviews for $2.50 apiece, teaching art history at the School of Visual Arts and trying to figure out what it meant to be an artist. He was making what he thought was “quite awful” work — triangles he cut out of Styrofoam, for example, and covered with fiberglass. The fumes from that process were awful, too, so he stopped.</p><p>When S.V.A. asked him to organize a Christmas show of drawings that year, he reached out to his friends <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/arts/design/09lewitt.html" title="">Sol LeWitt</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/30/archives/eva-hesse-dies-sculptor-was-34-work-in-synthetic-materials-won.html" title="">Eva Hesse</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/24/archives/robert-smithson-35-a-sculptor-is-dead.html" title="">Robert Smithson</a> as well as other artists he admired, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/arts/carl-andre-dead.html" title="">like Carl Andre</a>, and asked them for sketches of their works in progress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>S.V.A. didn’t have the money to frame the drawings, so Mr. Bochner photocopied them — the school had a new Xerox machine — and collected them in four binders, along with copies of articles from Scientific American, mathematical calculations and other bits of information. He set the binders on plain white pedestals and titled the show “Working Drawings and Other Visible Things on Paper Not Necessarily Meant to Be Viewed as Art.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20Bochner-wvbq/20Bochner-wvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20Bochner-wvbq/20Bochner-wvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20Bochner-wvbq/20Bochner-wvbq-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A black-and-white photo of an open three-ring binder holding multiple pieces of paper, sitting on a white platform." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20Bochner-wvbq/20Bochner-wvbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20Bochner-wvbq/20Bochner-wvbq-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20Bochner-wvbq/20Bochner-wvbq-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/20/multimedia/20Bochner-wvbq/20Bochner-wvbq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1471w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/1c4c6a11-76be-50b1-ac7b-815b91f52b6f" decoding="async" width="600" height="408"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Working Drawings and Other Visible Things on Paper Not Necessarily Meant to Be Viewed as Art,” 1966.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mousse Publishing, 2017</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It was an early salvo in the flourishing movement of conceptual art: the idea that an artwork didn’t need to be an object. Some say it may have been the first conceptual exhibition. Firsts are hard to prove, but it was a watershed moment nonetheless, and Mr. Bochner’s photocopied books inspired generations of artists.</p><p>“It was a breakthrough,” said James Meyer, the curator of modern art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. “Mel was a trailblazer in conceptual art. But his work also complicated the simplistic notion that the idea alone was the art. For Mel, the idea had to take material form. ‘No thought can exist without a sustaining support,’ as he put it.”</p><p>Mr. Meyer added: “He always said his work was experimental. It was an investigation. It was about asking questions: ‘If I did this, what would happen?’”</p><p>Mr. Bochner began playing with language, making word “portraits” of his friends. He rendered Ms. Hesse as the word “wrap,” which he wrote in the middle of a circular sheet of graph paper, with synonyms for the word swirling around it. He and Mr. Smithson wrote and illustrated <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/6/6c/Smithson_Robert_Bochner_Mel_1966_1979_In_the_Domain_of_the_Great_Bear.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an inscrutable article</a> that they conceived as an art piece — and a bit of prank — inspired by the Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. They titled it “The Domain of the Great Bear” and convinced Art Voices magazine to publish it. For Arts Magazine, Mr. Bochner wrote <a href="http://www.melbochner.net/files/beachboys.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an article about the Beach Boys</a> in which he listed personal details about the band members, including their heights and weights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bochner in Munich in 1969.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bochner Studio, via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-7"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“48” Standards,” 1969.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Measurement Plant,” 1969.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>He was interested in philosophy and mathematics, space and repetition.

He aimed his concepts almost exclusively at immediate perception, and his mind-twisting fusion of mental and physical space was, and still is, something new.”</p><p>Melvin Simon Bochner was born on Aug. 23, 1940, in Pittsburgh, one of three children of Meyer and Minnie (Horowitz) Bochner. His father was a sign painter.</p><p>Even as a child, Mel was a gifted artist, attending classes at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. He often assisted his father, from whom he learned to paint letters freehand. He received a scholarship to attend the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he was classically trained.</p><p>After graduating in 1962, he roamed around a bit, traveling to California and Mexico, working odd jobs, struggling to reconcile being an artist with his working-class background. He spent a few months in Chicago, auditing philosophy courses, before realizing, he said, that he didn’t want to study philosophy — he wanted to make things. In 1964, he headed to New York City.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Bochner in 1985 at the Villa Sciarra in Rome.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lizbeth Marano, via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>His first job was as a guard at the Jewish Museum (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/arts/brice-marden-dead.html" title="">Brice Marden</a> had just quit, so there was an opening), but he was fired after a year when he was discovered napping behind a Louise Nevelson sculpture. (In those days, he would stay up all night making art and come to work exhausted.)</p><p>In 2012, Mr. Bochner returned to the museum with “Strong Language,” a show that focused on his Thesaurus paintings, enormous pieces he began making after the turn of the millennium. These were riffs on existentially urgent words like <a href="https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/money-86288" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Money”</a> and <a href="https://collection.artbma.org/objects/99627/contempt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Contempt”</a> and <a href="https://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/Old/3783DF831C16EE9274CF41597ADEA3D2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Old,”</a> which he rendered gorgeously in bright neon colors, painting synonyms and phrases for each title that marched across the canvas, careering from the conventional to the vulgar. (“Old” concludes with the words “Can’t Get It Up.”) The works are at once comical and profound.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-18"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Blah, Blah, Blah,” 2008.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Master of the Universe,” 2010.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-19"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“Snarl,” 2015.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>“$#!+ / Say No More,” 2018.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Peter Freeman Inc., New York/Paris</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The show included a piece called “The Joys of Yiddish,” a nod to Leo Rosten’s classic book of the same name from which Mr. Bochner collected some of the most vivid and beloved slurs — “nudnick,” “schlemiel” and “schmo” among them — and painted them in yellow on a black background. The colors reference not just classic street signage but, more darkly, the yellow armbands that Nazis forced Jewish people to wear. The words are separated by commas because, as Mr. Bochner explained, a comma indicates that a thought is ongoing.
