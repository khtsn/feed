    <h1>Why the Far-Right AfD Is Unlikely to Join Germany’s Next Government</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Germany’s next government will almost certainly be a coalition of multiple political parties, to form a majority in Parliament. But one party will almost certainly be excluded from that coalition, no matter how well it ultimately performs: the hard-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.</p><p>While early exit polls on Sunday showed the AfD in second place, largely on the strength of its opposition to mass migration and its pledge to deport some migrants, every other mainstream German party refuses to invite it into government. That blockade is known in Germany as the “firewall,” and it is a direct result of the country’s post-World War II efforts to suppress parties and voices labeled extreme.</p><p>Rival parties cite a wide array of evidence for calling the AfD extreme and for keeping it behind the firewall. Some parts of the AfD have been classified as extremist by German intelligence. Some of its members have been convicted of violating German law against the use of Nazi slogans, and others have been arrested for trying to overthrow the federal government. Recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/world/europe/alternative-for-germany-youth.html" title="">an AfD volunteer greeted</a> fellow election canvassers, in front of a New York Times reporter, with a Nazi salute.</p><p>To date, Germany has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/world/europe/vance-europe-immigration-ukraine.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">been the most successful</a> major European power at shutting its hard-right party out of power, along with France, where a group of rival parties engaged in strategic voting last summer to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/world/europe/france-elections-europe-left-right.html" title="">deny</a> the hard-right National Rally a parliamentary majority.</p></div></div>
