He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/world/europe/prince-harry-security-uk.html" title="">lost a previous stage</a> of the case in February last year, but a judge later granted him <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/r-duke-of-sussex-v-sshd/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permission to appeal</a> the ruling on limited grounds. The judge said that he was persuaded, although “not without hesitation,” that an appeal had a “real prospect of success.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Three judges at London’s Court of Appeal will hear arguments by Harry’s lawyers that the decision to withdraw protection violated official policy. Part of the case will be conducted in private because of the sensitive nature of evidence around security processes and risk assessments, the court ruled.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Harry leaving a London court in 2023 during a previous hearing to challenge the removal of his security detail.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kin Cheung/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-3ffc5a91">What is the case about?</h2><p>The case concerns a Feb. 28, 2020, decision that Harry and Meghan would no longer qualify for publicly financed security protection in the U.K., after they withdrew from their official roles and started a new life in Canada. In March 2020, they moved from Vancouver to California.</p><p>The decision was made by a body called the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known as Ravec, which brings together government officials, the police and members of the royal household. Ravec is responsible for making security arrangements for the royal family and other U.K.-based figures who are at particular risk from terrorism, obsessive behavior or other threats.</p><p>During the first stage of Harry’s case, heard at the High Court in London in 2022, his lawyers said that he had not known that the committee existed and had no opportunity to weigh in on its decision. After being told that discussions were taking place over his security provision, he wrote a letter to a government official expressing disbelief and concern. The letter, dated Feb. 10, 2020, mentioned his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.</p><p>Harry argued that his family was at even greater risk because of “additional layers of racism and extremism,” and that security from the Metropolitan Police in London was essential. He wrote that he believed the lack of consultation could be “some form of punishment for protecting my family and putting them first” — an accusation the British government has denied.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-6"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>In 2022, Harry and Meghan visited Britain to attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, and paid for security.

Permission is not automatically granted, because judges must decide whether there is any prospect that it would be successful.</p><p>Britain’s Home Office said it could not comment directly on the court case but said in a statement: “The U.K. government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our longstanding policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals’ security.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
