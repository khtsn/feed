Consumer confidence has fallen for the third consecutive month, not only about personal finances, but also the job market and stock markets. Since December, sentiment has tumbled 22 percent.</p><p>“Many consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors; frequent gyrations in economic policies make it very difficult for consumers to plan for the future, regardless of one’s policy preferences,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan.</p><p>Consumers also revised up their expectations for inflation, both for the year ahead and over a five-year horizon. Over the next 12 months, consumers expect inflation to rise to 4.9 percent, up from a forecast for 4.3 percent last month. Over the longer run, expectations rose to 3.9 percent in what was the largest monthly jump since 1993. According to the latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/business/economy/inflation-cpi-february-economy.html" title="">Consumer Price Index</a> report, inflation stands at 2.8 percent.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“This is an horrific report,” said Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Elevated economic policy uncertainty and the sharp drop in stock prices have greatly undermined consumers’ confidence.”</p><p>The preliminary data comes as President Trump and his top economic advisers have acknowledged that the president’s plans to reshape global trade through aggressive tariffs, to right size government spending and to alter the American immigration system, among other sweeping changes could hurt the economy or even push it into a recession.</p><p>Mr. Trump has referred to it as a “period of transition,” and recently refused to rule out a recession, sparking volatility across financial markets. The S&amp;P 500 rebounded on Friday after falling into a correction on Thursday, meaning it is down 10 percent or more from its peak.</p><p>One of the biggest criticisms of the University of Michigan survey is that it has in recent months reflected a huge partisan split, with Republicans upbeat about the economy and inflation following Mr. Trump’s re-election and Democrats souring. That divide persisted in March, but Republicans and independents started to shift their perspective in a more negative direction.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is closely watching expectations data for any sign that the central bank’s grip on inflation is slipping, or that it needs to pay more attention to the prospects of slowing growth. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, suggested recently that sentiment data has not been a good predictor for future consumer spending, but he appeared attuned to the risk that policy uncertainty and tariffs could dent growth overall.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The central bank is all but guaranteed to hold interest rates steady when it meets next week given its stance that the economy, despite the high degree of uncertainty, still remains on solid footing.</p><p>If inflation stays sticky for too long, or rises again, the Fed has signaled that it is prepared to push rate cuts further into the future. If, however, the labor market starts to buckle, it could cut earlier and faster than expected.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/colby-smith">More about Colby Smith</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>A version of this article appears in print on <span> </span>, Section </p><!-- --><p>B</p><!-- --><p>, Page </p><!-- --><p>3</p><!-- --><p> of the New York edition</p><!-- --><p> with the headline: </p><!-- --><p>Consumer Confidence Drops as Inflation Worries Rise<span>. <a href="https://nytimes.wrightsmedia.com/">Order Reprints</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper">Today’s Paper</a> | <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?campaignId=48JQY">Subscribe</a></span></p></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
