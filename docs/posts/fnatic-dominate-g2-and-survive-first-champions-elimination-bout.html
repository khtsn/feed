    <h1>FNATIC dominate G2 and survive first Champions elimination bout</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>FNATIC delivered an absolutely clinical performance in a 2-1 victory over G2 Esports in the first round of the lower bracket at Valorant Champions 2024. They will face Sentinels or EDward Gaming on Sunday.</p>

<p>After a soul-crushing 13-3 win on their own pick of Haven, FNATIC took to Bind. The match was incredibly tight throughout the second half up until the final round of regulation, when a quick 3K from Chronicle closed out the map and match.</p>

<p>On Haven, the most dominant of the two maps, Alfajer delivered a 2.02 rating — a rare sight in international Valorant — and 24 kills in just 16 rounds. His ADR encroached on 300 and his mere seven deaths allowed for a 94% KAST on Iso.</p>

<p>This article will be updated with a full recap.</p>
