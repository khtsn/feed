Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Mideast envoy, pitched the latest framework in the past week. It would halt fighting for at least two months, ensure the release of half of the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and lead to further U.S.-backed negotiations on a permanent end to the war.</p><p>A Hamas official outside Gaza said the group was seeking amendments on issues including guarantees on ending the war and the details of the hostage-for-prisoner swaps. The official requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p><p>While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says he is willing to reach a temporary cease-fire with Hamas, he has ruled out ending the war unless the group lays down its weapons and sends its leaders into exile. Hamas has so far refused those terms and wants firm guarantees that the war will end permanently.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Israel ended a two-month cease-fire in mid-March — citing a deadlock in talks on the next steps in the truce — and resumed attacks on Hamas while blockading humanitarian aid from entering the enclave.</p><p>Hamas said on Saturday that it had submitted an answer to the latest cease-fire proposal that aimed to achieve a permanent cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to desperate and hungry Palestinians in Gaza. The wording indicated that the group was seeking more than the current proposal’s guarantee of a temporary pause in hostilities.</p><p>The group said Mr. Witkoff’s latest proposal would require Hamas to turn over 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>Hamas negotiators have already said they are willing to free the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for a permanent end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory. About 20 living hostages and the bodies of more than 30 others are believed to still be in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis at a rally on Wednesday in Tel Aviv marking 600 days since the hostages were taken by Hamas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leo Correa/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Both Israel and Hamas have faced rising international pressure lately to halt the fighting.</p><p>Palestinians in Gaza, furious over more than a year of war and hunger, have joined rare protests against Hamas, calling for the group to leave the enclave it has ruled since 2007. And since resuming its offensive in March, Israel has killed several senior Hamas leaders in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israel’s traditional allies, including the Trump administration, have expressed growing impatience and even anger over the protracted war, the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza that have created a risk of famine, and the Israeli threats to significantly widen the offensive against Hamas.</p><p>Israel went to war after Hamas-led Palestinian militants launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 as hostages, mostly civilians.</p><p>In response, Israel’s devastating assault in Gaza has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
