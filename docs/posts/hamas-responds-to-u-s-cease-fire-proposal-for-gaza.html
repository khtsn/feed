Israel ended a two-month cease-fire in mid-March — citing a deadlock in talks on the next steps in the truce — and resumed attacks on Hamas while blockading humanitarian aid from entering the enclave.</p><p>The group did not say whether it had accepted or rejected the deal or if it had put forward new conditions that may or may not be acceptable to Israel.</p><p>Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Mideast envoy, pitched the latest cease-fire framework in the past week. The truce would halt fighting for at least two months, ensure the release of half of the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and lead to further U.S.-backed negotiations on a permanent end to the war.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Hamas said it had submitted an answer “after conducting a round of national consultations” that aimed to achieve a permanent cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to desperate and hungry Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>Hamas negotiators have said they are willing to free the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory. About 20 living hostages and the bodies of more than 30 others are believed to still be in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis at a rally on Wednesday in Tel Aviv marking 600 days since the hostages were taken by Hamas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leo Correa/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Hamas said Mr. Witkoff’s proposal would require the group to turn over 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>But while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says he is willing to reach a temporary cease-fire with Hamas, he has ruled out ending the war unless the group lays down its weapons and sends its leaders into exile. Hamas has so far refused those terms and wants firm guarantees that the war will end permanently.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Both sides have faced rising international pressure to halt the fighting.</p><p>Israel’s traditional allies, including the Trump administration, have expressed growing impatience and even anger over the protracted war, the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza that have created a risk of famine, and the Israeli threats to significantly widen the offensive against Hamas.</p><p>Since resuming its offensive in March, Israel has killed several of Hamas’s senior leaders in Gaza.</p><p>This past month, Israeli aircraft bombarded the vicinity of the European Hospital near the southern city of Khan Younis in an attempt to assassinate Mohammad Sinwar, one of Hamas’s top remaining militant commanders. Neither Israel nor Hamas has publicly confirmed his fate.</p><p>Israel went to war after Hamas-led Palestinian militants launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 as hostages, mostly civilians.</p><p>In response, Israel’s devastating assault in Gaza has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
