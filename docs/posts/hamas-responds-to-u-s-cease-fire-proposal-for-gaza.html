But it was not immediately clear whether Hamas’s response cleared the way for progress in halting the hostilities.</p><p>An Israeli official said Hamas was demanding stronger guarantees that the temporary cease-fire would lead to a lasting end to the war. That issue has long been the core sticking point in the negotiations with Israel.</p><p>Hamas was seeking amendments on issues including guarantees on ending the war and the details of the hostage-for-prisoner swaps, a Hamas official outside of Gaza confirmed. Both the Israeli and the Hamas officials requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says he is willing to reach a temporary cease-fire with Hamas to free hostages, he has ruled out ending the war unless the group lays down its weapons and sends its leaders into exile. Hamas has said it is ready to end the war in exchange for turning over all of their remaining captives.</p><p>U.S. officials and other mediators have struggled cobble together a new truce since Israel ended the last cease-fire with Hamas in mid-March. Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Mideast envoy, pitched the latest frameworks over the past week, which would lead to further U.S.-backed negotiations on a permanent end to the war, a step that was also supposed to happen under the previous cease-fire.</p><p>Hamas said on Saturday that it had submitted an answer to the proposal that aimed to achieve a permanent cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to desperate and hungry Palestinians in Gaza. The wording indicated that the group was seeking more than the current proposal’s guarantee of a temporary pause in hostilities.</p><p>The group said that as part of the proposed agreement, Hamas would turn over 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>About 20 living hostages and the bodies of more than 30 others are believed to still be in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Israelis at a rally on Wednesday in Tel Aviv marking 600 days since the hostages were taken by Hamas.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Leo Correa/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>White House officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump had suggested on Friday that Hamas was ready to “get out of that mess” following nearly 20 months of devastating war.</p><p>“They’re in a big mess. I think they want to get out of it,” Mr. Trump told reporters.</p><p>Israel ended a two-month cease-fire in mid-March — citing a deadlock in talks on the next steps in the truce. Israeli forces then resumed attacks in Gaza while blockading humanitarian aid from entering the enclave, a ban that Israel relaxed only last week.</p><p>While Israel and Hamas have both dug into their respective bargaining positions, both sides have also faced rising international pressure lately to halt the fighting.</p><p>Palestinians in Gaza, furious over more than a year of war, hunger and bombardment, have held rare protests against Hamas, calling for the group to leave the enclave it has ruled since 2007. And since resuming its offensive in March, Israel has killed several senior Hamas leaders in Gaza.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Israel’s traditional allies, including the Trump administration, have expressed growing impatience and even anger over the protracted war, the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza that have created a risk of famine, and Israel’s threats to significantly widen the offensive against Hamas.</p><p>Israel went to war after Hamas-led Palestinian militants launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 as hostages, mostly civilians. Israel’s devastating assault in Gaza has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Aaron Boxerman is a Times reporter covering Israel and Gaza.
