The bus pulled away, the Los Angeles Police Department <a href="https://x.com/LAPDPIO/status/1838890322929037762" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, and officers pursued the bus. The police were eventually able to stop the bus in downtown using spike strips, and a S.W.A.T. team went onboard, taking the suspect into custody. </p><p>The bus driver and two passengers were also onboard, the police said. One passenger died after being taken to hospital with gunshot wounds, and the other passenger was not injured. </p><p>The bus driver was unharmed, said the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Donald Graham, deputy chief for the Los Angeles Police Department, said that the driver had steered the bus for an hour with the hijacker on board before police were able to stop the bus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I think the world of the operator,” Mr. Graham said at a news conference.</p><p>The authority was providing the driver with support, its statement said, and added that the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating. </p><p>Footage circulating online early Wednesday appeared to show police officers and police vehicles surrounding a stationary bus, and a person in the front seat of the bus holding up their hands.</p><p>In March, a man was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of kidnapping after the police said he had hijacked a bus. The man, Anai Lindsey, threatened the driver, the only person onboard, and indicated that he had a gun. The bus eventually crashed into several vehicles and a hotel, injuring one person.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
