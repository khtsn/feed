Andrew M. Cuomo was denied more than $600,000 in public matching funds on Monday after the New York City Campaign Finance Board found that he most likely engaged in illicit coordination with a super PAC supporting his campaign for mayor.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/nyregion/cuomo-super-pac-violation.html" title="">aroused suspicion</a> when he posted on his campaign website what looked to be a set of detailed spending instructions for anyone hoping to help. The super PAC, Fix the City, began airing <a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/e91180ce-515c-474b-add8-e3c643434734/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an ad</a> just days later that appeared to align with some of those requests, echoing themes and data points.</p><p>The tactic in question, known as red-boxing because of the frequent use of red-bordered boxes to highlight the instructions, has become common in federal races as a way to circumvent anti-coordination rules in plain sight. But the New York City Campaign Finance Board has explicitly warned against it.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo still received $1.5 million in public matching funds. He had theoretically qualified for $2.1 million, but the board decided to withhold $622,056 — the amount that the super PAC paid for the ad — because it said there was “reason to believe” that the television commercial was “not independent of the Cuomo campaign.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The penalty, while significant, will have little practical effect on Mr. Cuomo’s campaign, given the level of super PAC support he has attracted. Fix the City has already reported <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/FTMSearch/IndependentSpenders/Contributions?ec=2025&amp;rt=ind&amp;indId=Z193" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raising more than $7 million</a>, and hopes to ultimately spend close to double what any individual candidate is allowed to in the race.</p><p>Still, it is the latest embarrassing setback for a candidate who has staked his campaign on a reputation of competence. </p><p>Mr. Cuomo was already denied public matching funds once before, last month, after his campaign did not collect all the proper information from donors. He also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/nyregion/cuomo-chatgpt-housing-ai.html" title="">generated unwanted headlines</a> when he released a major housing plan that included incoherent passages and a ChatGPT-derived hyperlink to a news article.</p><p>Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement that the campaign would work to resolve the most recent issue with the board.</p><p>“Our campaign has operated in full compliance with the campaign finance laws and rules, and everything on our website was reviewed and approved by our legal team in advance of publication,” he said, adding that other candidates had published similar information online.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>He added, “We look forward to making that clear when we respond to the board’s preliminary ruling and receiving the full matching funds to which the campaign is entitled.”</p><p>A spokeswoman for Fix the City, Liz Benjamin, said the ad had been made “lawfully and without the insight or influence of any prohibited outside entities.”</p><p>Bill Knapp, the veteran ad maker working for the super PAC, said he had made the commercial “independently, using publicly available information about the candidate and his policy proposals.”</p><p>The Campaign Finance Board also voted on Monday to continue withholding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/nyregion/eric-adams-matching-funds-campaign-finance.html" title="">millions of dollars in matching funds</a> from Mayor Eric Adams over concerns about his fund-raising practices. Mr. Adams withdrew from the Democratic primary to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/nyregion/eric-adams-independent-mayor.html" title="">run as an independent</a> in the general election. </p><p>Despite the turbulence surrounding his campaign, Mr. Cuomo leads in polls just six weeks ahead of the June 24 primary.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Campaign ethics watchdogs and Mr. Cuomo’s opponents have warned for months that his allies could use the super PAC to circumvent the city’s strict fund-raising and spending limits for campaigns. The group is run by a loyal former Cuomo aide, Steven M. Cohen.</p><p>The first suggestion of possible collusion arose in late April, when Mr. Cuomo updated a page on his campaign website. Labeled a “message for voters,” the page read more like a set of instructions for Fix the City or other groups wishing to help him. It included polling information, clips of the candidate speaking and a four-point list explaining how he could benefit from advertisements promoting, say, his record on antisemitism, or targeting voters between the ages of 40 and 55.</p><p>The Campaign Finance Board adopted new rules late last year that explicitly warn campaigns against posting such instructions. But under the rules, a campaign is in violation only if a super PAC actually acts on them.</p><p>The board found that Fix the City had most likely done just that in early May when it began running a new 30-second ad on broadcast television that mirrored Mr. Cuomo’s “message for voters.”</p><p>Mr. Cuomo’s red box had stressed that he was the only candidate “who can get things done.” And it said he would benefit from highlighting his plan for “500,000 new affordable housing units over the next 10 years, universal 3-K in every neighborhood and 5,000 new police officers patrolling the subways and high-crime areas.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Getting things done, that’s Cuomo,” a narrator says in the opening of the super PAC’s ad. It goes on to tick through Mr. Cuomo’s priorities: “Five thousand more cops. Cut red tape for affordable housing and build 500,000 new units. Universal 3-K in every neighborhood.”</p><p>Last Monday, shortly after the ad appeared on TV, the Campaign Finance Board sent a warning to every city campaign about red boxes. Mr. Cuomo’s campaign denied that it was trying to coordinate with the super PAC, but subsequently took down the web page containing the instructions.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 after a series of sexual harassment allegations that he denies, is new to the city’s complex campaign finance system. He has faced ethics issues in the past, including his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/nyregion/in-moreland-commission-inquiry-insufficient-evidence-to-prove-a-crime.html" title="">interference with an anticorruption panel</a> known as the Moreland Commission that he created and abruptly shut down.</p><p>Zellnor Myrie, a Democratic mayoral candidate who called for an investigation into Mr. Cuomo’s red box last week, said the conduct was consistent with earlier episodes in which Mr. Cuomo pushed the bounds of campaign finance or other ethics rules.</p><p>“As Donald Trump repeatedly undermines our judicial system, Democrats need a leader in City Hall who exemplifies integrity and will uphold the rule of law,” Mr. Myrie said. “Not one who skirts the law for personal gain.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Brad Lander, the city comptroller who is running for mayor, said in a statement that Mr. Cuomo was a “corruption magnet” and criticized his coordination with the super PAC.</p><p>“New York City deserves better than four more years of incompetence and chaos,” he said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emma G. Fitzsimmons is the City Hall bureau chief for The Times, covering Mayor Eric Adams and his administration.</p></div><div><p>Nicholas Fandos is a Times reporter covering New York politics and government.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
