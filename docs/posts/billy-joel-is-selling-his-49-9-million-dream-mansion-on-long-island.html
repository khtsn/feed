He took a tiring minimum wage job dredging oysters.</p><p>The dredge crisscrossed the waters of Long Island Sound, including a bay that curves like a comma and faces some of the most expensive real estate in the United States. From the boat, he could see a stately brick mansion.</p><p>“Rich bastards,” he thought to himself. “I’ll never live in a house like that.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10listing-billyjoel-kljw/10listing-billyjoel-kljw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10listing-billyjoel-kljw/10listing-billyjoel-kljw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/10/multimedia/10listing-billyjoel-kljw/10listing-billyjoel-kljw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A man in a dark suit and a black turtleneck sits at the piano, a microphone close to his lips.

And I would ride my bicycle up here and take a bike ride and look at all the rich people and cuss them out,” he says.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Once called “Yeardon,” Billy Joel renamed his mansion “MiddleSea.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>On Wednesday, a team of real estate agents and publicists working on his behalf held an open house to sell it. The listing price is $49.9 million.</p><p>The hourslong affair was by invitation only, and high-end real estate agents arrived by speedboat. Potential buyers are in the 0.1 percent — at least one billionaire and the representative of a Brussels-based hedge fund were expected to tour it. Among Mr. Joel’s former neighbors are Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity and one of the heirs to the Exxon Mobil fortune, say his staff.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It’s a crowd that is a world away from the one that Mr. Joel used to inhabit, his identity and music closely tied with Long Island’s working class.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Real estate agents arrived by speedboat to tour Billy Joel’s waterfront estate. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><p>Hicksville, where he grew up in the 1950s and ’60s, is less than 15 miles away from his mansion. When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, his mother sent him to a nearby store to rent a TV. He returned with the TV on a dolly, explained his biographer Fred Schruers.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Potential buyers and real estate agents mingled at an “elevated open house.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Though his family didn’t have a television set, they did have a beat-up Lester upright piano, and his mother insisted he take lessons, Mr. Schruers said. Eager to go out and play with his friends, he resented practicing so he learned to imitate the style of Beethoven just well enough to make his mother think that he was following the sheet music, said Mr. Joel.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The name “MiddleSea” refers both to the estate’s waterfront location and to the musical middle C note. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>He tried to embed those modest musical roots into the property when he first bought it by naming it “MiddleSea” — a reference to its location in the middle of the sea, located on a spit that juts out with Oyster Bay on one side and Cold Spring Harbor on the other. But it’s also a double entendre referring to the note of middle C, the first key that beginning piano players learn.</p><p>“If it’s not for me being able to take piano lessons, I probably would never have been able to afford a high-flying property like this. So, I named it after the first note which I learned on the piano, which was C,” he explained.</p><p>The high-flying property at 26 acres has a main house, a beach house and two guesthouses, totaling 18 bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, as well as three swimming pools, a bowling alley and a helipad.</p></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-16"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><section aria-label="Gallery" data-testid="Gallery"><div><ol><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler</span></li><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li></li><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li></li></ol></div><nav><span></span></nav></section></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>The expansiveness of the grounds are hard to put into words, so I walked from one end of the property line to the other. At a brisk pace, it took me 9 minutes 3 seconds, almost the same amount of time that it takes me to walk seven city blocks in Manhattan.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Guests as well as Mr. Joel get around in golf carts — electric ones, his property manager is quick to note.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-20"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Joel and guests to his home often use golf carts to traverse the expansive property.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>A sandy beach, stretching over 2,000 feet graces the edge of the property.</p><p>On Long Island’s “Gold Coast,” as the area is known, “it’s rare to find a property with 200 feet of beach,” said Emmett Laffey, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, who is representing Mr. Joel in the sale of the property.</p><p>The singer still owns other property on Long Island, including a home in Sag Harbor, but his base is now in Florida, where his two youngest daughters, ages 7 and 9, are enrolled in school. “Once they started going to school, you’re kind of locked in,” Mr. Joel said.</p><p>That’s one reason he’s selling. There’s also a more mundane concern: taxes.</p><p>At $567,686, the yearly taxes on the property are more than the median sales price of a single-family home in the United States. “It’s not cheap, let’s put it that way,” he said. “As successful, I’ve been financially, yeah, that’s, you know, that’s a lot.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="CardDeckBlock-23"><div data-testid="cardDeck"><section aria-label="Gallery" data-testid="Gallery"><div><ol><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><span>Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></li><li></li></ol></div><nav><span></span></nav></section></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>The home first went up for sale last year. A renovation that involved replacing all the bathroom fixtures, putting in brand-new marble floors, revamping the kitchens and redoing the brick walkways and patios, was still underway — tarps covered certain rooms and it didn’t show well, said Mr. Laffey. It was taken off the market and re-listed last month after the renovations were completed, with a bump in the price tag to $49.9 million from $49 million.</p><p>To market a property at this price point, an “elevated open house” was apropos. Liveried waiters served shrimp and goat cheese hors d’oeuvres, as classical music poured out from a property-wide speaker system.</p><p>The group of high-end agents who arrived by speedboat to tour the property were seeing it for the first time the way Mr. Joel first saw it — from the coast, except that he was on a oyster boat and the guests arrived clutching luxury purses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-25"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guests at Billy Joel’s open house enjoyed scoops of gelato. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>One woman from the group took off her heels and ran back barefoot, after realizing she had forgotten her Dior purse on the dock — the group had stopped to take photos against the shimmering water.</p><p>“This is so nice,” said one. “Gorgeous,” said another, as the mansion on the hill came into focus. “What a view,” said a third.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Guests took photos while at the open house. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-13"><div><p>What they toured was actually a restoration. Mr. Joel’s property manager, Chad Nuzzi, discovered blueprints and plans, dated 1913 and signed by George Bullock, a railway magnate, in a tucked away closet. The property had been called “Yeadon,” thought by Mr. Joel and his staff to be a reference to Mr. Bullock’s ancestral village in England, and had been subdivided into four lots.</p><p>In the years that followed, Mr. Joel said he worked to reconstitute the original estate — recreating a piece of land of Gatsbian proportions. (The trust that bought the original parcel in 2002 is listed as “F. Scott LLC,” a possible reference to F. Scott Fitzgerald.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-31"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The view of “MiddleSea” walking from the dock. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Eric Striffler for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>Mr. Joel has lived a life of luxury there. As fans of the working class nostalgia embedded in his songs filled up Madison Square Garden again and again, Mr. Joel headed to the concert venue by helicopter — a 13-minute ride from tail up to tail down — from his helipad.</p><p>Not bad for a former oysterman.</p><p>“I love this property. I don’t think there’s a property as beautiful as this,” he said. “It’s got that Gatsby sense to it, which I dreamed about as a little boy. When I hand over the keys, there’ll be some regret.”</p><p>Kitty Bennett<!-- --> contributed research.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Rukmini Callimachi is a three-time Pulitzer Prize finalist.
