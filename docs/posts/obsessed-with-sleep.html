    <h1>Obsessed with Sleep</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><div><div><div><div><p><span itemprop="name">Maxwell Strachan</span></p><p>I’m an editor on Well, The Times’s personal health section.</p></div></div></div></div><p>Americans used to say we’d sleep when we were dead. We viewed sleep as a waste of time — something prized by the lazy, and minimized by the industrious.</p><p>How times have changed. These days, getting in bed early is cool. People, especially those in younger generations, have come to better understand the benefits of a good night’s rest, and many now make sleep a central part of their personal health routines.</p><p>Experts say this is a good thing: Consistently solid sleep can benefit your heart, brain, immune system and mental health. But our newfound love of sleep is also leading us to strange places. On social media, you can find some people mixing concoctions meant to induce sleep — called “sleepy girl mocktails” — and others trying on sleep aids like mouth tape, nose tape and jaw straps, sometimes all at once. For many, sleep has become something to be optimized, even perfected.</p><p>Kate Lindsay has a fascinating new story in The Times today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/well/the-quest-for-perfect-sleep-goes-viral.html" title="">that explores this growing fixation</a> — specifically, the large number of people for whom good sleep is not good enough. They are sometimes called “sleepmaxxers.” Kate’s story raises a question I’ve been wondering myself: After so many years of worrying too little about sleep, is it possible some of us have started worrying too much?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>In today’s newsletter, I’ll walk you through the science behind some popular methods for improving sleep, and the possible downsides of caring too much about it.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A “sleepy girl mocktail.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Molly Matalon for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><h2 id="link-33e3d7a">Sleep, Inc.</h2><p>A few lucky people can fall asleep as soon as their heads hit the pillow. For the rest of us, a multibillion-dollar industry offers a boundless supply of products that promise to help.</p><p>There are best-selling guidebooks, smartwatches, smart rings, temperature-changing mattresses, straps, plugs, masks, glasses and even mists. And that’s to say nothing of the enormous variety of sleep-inducing pills and gummies. People routinely get millions of views on TikTok and Instagram testing out sleep hacks and accessories, including by filming themselves taking off all the accouterment, a trend known as “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maytexmyers/video/7384826371513617707" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">morning shed</a>.”</p><p>Is this all a case of consumerism gone wild, or does any of this stuff actually help? The Times’s Well desk has looked into the science behind a few of these products. Here’s what we found:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/well/live/mouth-taping-benefits-sleep.html" title="">Mouth tape</a></strong><strong>:</strong> A few small studies have found people with mild sleep apnea snored a bit less (or less severely) when they taped their lips closed. The effects for people without sleep apnea are less clear. But experts say you should probably steer clear of mouth tape if you struggle to breathe through your nose, whether because of a deviated septum, allergies, chronic congestion or something else entirely.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/17/well/live/sleepy-girl-mocktail-cherry-magnesium.html" title="">Magnesium</a></strong><strong>: </strong>This common sleep supplement is one part of the viral “sleepy girl mocktail.” And while some observational studies have linked magnesium to better sleep quality, several other, more rigorous trials have found that it has no effect for most people. That said, it’s not harmful, so if it works for you, feel free to keep taking it — you may benefit from a placebo effect.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/well/mind/melatonin-sleep-insomnia.html" title="">Melatonin</a></strong><strong>:</strong> One of the most common sleep-related supplements is also one of the most misused. Many people who take melatonin do so right before they get in bed. But, as the Well team has explained, melatonin is more like a sunset than a light switch. It is best taken hours before bed, so that it can aid your body in the process of winding down.</p></li></ul><h2 id="link-1cee6851">So what works?</h2><p>There’s good news: Sleep experts say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/07/well/live/sleep-better-age.html" title="">the most reliable hacks are often the cheapest and most simple</a>. Get in and out of bed at the same time every day, no matter how well you sleep. Lower the temperature in your room to between 65 and 68 degrees. Limit alcohol and caffeine in the hours before bed. Exercise!</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Experts also recommend a wind-down period every night. It’s better if that time doesn’t include screens, but if television relaxes you, consider something light that you’ve already seen. (I like to watch “Veep,” “The Office” or “30 Rock” before bed.)</p><p>And if all else fails, you can stick your head in a freezer. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/well/better-sleep-tips.html" title="">Yes, really</a>.</p><p>So long as a gadget or product isn’t making your sleep worse, or harming you, there’s no real problem with it. Maybe sipping a “sleepy girl mocktail” or spraying magnesium on your feet helps you relax.</p><p>But watch out for signs that you are becoming fixated on sleep. In 2017, a few researchers came up with the word “orthosomnia” to describe a phenomenon in which people who wear sleep trackers on a “perfectionistic quest for the ideal sleep” actually have their sleep become worse. If that sounds like you, it might be time to take a step back.</p><p>“Sleep is a passive process,” one doctor told Kate. “It is to be protected, not forced — or ‘maximized.’” In short, winding down before sleep: good. Winding yourself up about sleep? Not so much.</p><p><strong>For more:</strong> Read Kate’s story on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/well/the-quest-for-perfect-sleep-goes-viral.html" title="">the quest for sleep perfection</a>.</p><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-41e54375">2024 Election</h2></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Donald Trump</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Edmundo González, center, at a rally in May.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lexi Parra for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><ul><li><p>Edmundo González — the Venezuelan opposition candidate who is widely considered to have won July’s disputed presidential election — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-argentina-embassy.html" title="">has fled the country</a>.

It makes the trans experience more understandable. However, I’m not that interested in normalizing for people who have hated me for centuries. I want the movie to make other people be gentler and softer and caring, and maybe if you’re a father who loved “Anchorman” and you’ve got a trans kid now, maybe you’re going to open yourself up.</p><p><em>Ferrell</em>: You’re willing to sit down and have a conversation.</p><p><em>Steele</em>: That’s the work I want the movie to do.
