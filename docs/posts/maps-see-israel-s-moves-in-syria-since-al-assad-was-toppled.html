Since then, the border mostly stayed quiet. Over the past few years, Israel has targeted Iranian officials and militias in Syria as part of the country’s shadow war with Iran. Mr. al-Assad’s regime was closely aligned with Tehran, Israel’s regional foe.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>But after Mr. al-Assad was deposed on Dec. 8, Israel unleashed a far more public and extensive offensive. Israeli warplanes and battleships bombarded more than 350 targets, including Syrian military bases, chemical weapons caches, antiaircraft batteries and long-range missiles, according to the Israeli government in a statement on Dec. 10. Since then, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, has reported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/world/middleeast/syria-israel-strikes.html" title="">further strikes</a>. </p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israeli troops have also marched into Syrian territory in the largest overt operation there since the 1973 war. After that conflict, both sides had agreed that United Nations peacekeepers would monitor a 155-square-mile demilitarized zone between their forces.</p><p>Israeli forces now hold the peak of Mount Hermon, the highest point in Syrian territory, as well as other positions deeper inside Syria.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-8"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="A man wearing a bulletproof vest circled by a group of soldiers in front of tents in rugged terrain." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/18/multimedia/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj/idf-syria-hermon-tlpj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/7ec9c02a-6151-53ce-a49c-e2380bef31e3" decoding="async" width="600" height="399"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A photograph released by the Israeli government on Tuesday showing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among members of the Israeli military at Mount Hermon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Israeli Government, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>It is unclear how long they will stay.</p><p>Ahmad al-Shara, whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebel faction led the campaign that toppled Mr. al-Assad, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/16/world/syria-assad-rebels-news#syria-al-sharah" title="">criticized</a> the Israeli operation.</p><p>Mr. al-Shara pledged that Syria would abide by a 1974 cease-fire agreement with Israel, and argued that the downfall of Mr. al-Assad had ended the threat of Iranian militias menacing Israel from Syrian territory.</p><p>Israeli leaders have suggested that Israeli troops will stay in newly captured Syrian territory until “another arrangement is found.” They have referred to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist group, appearing to reject Mr. al-Shara’s assurances for the time being.</p><p>“The collapse of the Syrian regime created a vacuum on Israel’s border and in the buffer zone,” said Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities.”</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
