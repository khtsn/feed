Fans gasped, awed at the precision. Referees conferred, making sure all was aboveboard.</p><p>“We’re ready to rumble,” said Markus Chencinsky, 50, a driver from Vienna.</p><p>Despite the adrenaline, the speed and the thousands of eyes, this was not a demolition derby or a stunt-driving expo.</p><p>Instead, the competitors facing off on Saturday in a central square of Frankfurt were the captains of Europe’s tram systems. They had come to Germany’s financial hub to vie for the trophy at the 11th <a href="https://www.tramem.eu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Tramdriver Championship</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nWeSxnFALo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual public transit jamboree</a> might best be described as tram dressage. The drivers coaxed their commuter chariots through an obstacle course meant to test their whimsy, mettle and precision.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We try to mirror the entire range of skills a driver should have,” said Wieland Stumpf, the president of the championship.</p><p>Some events focused on safety: Drivers had to emergency brake at a precise spot, just as if a cyclist had swerved in front of them. Another tested their ability to multitask: Could they remember a series of symbols that appeared on mock traffic signs?</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>One of the skills events tested how smoothly and gently a driver could stop.

(A front-mounted camera showed every lost droplet: the less spilled, the more points.)</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>One test was downright counterintuitive: Tram billiards, in which a driver steers the vehicle to gently knock a pool cue attached to a stand into a billiard ball on a table. (The highest possible score for the billiards portion was 500 points, awarded if the ball rolled to a stop right in the middle of the table.)</p><p>“It’s not often you’re trying to hit something with your tram,” joked Victoria Young, 39, of Edinburgh. “You’ve just got this feeling inside you that says, ‘I should be stopping now.’”</p><p>Tram driving is surprisingly gentle — even for all its mandated collisions. It stands out from other niche sports involving heavy machinery.</p><p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GTZ8K27t8A" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawn mower racing</a>, which is half motocross, half go-karting. Or snowmobile watercross, in which competitors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdTA7EWwrmA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drive their vehicles onto water</a>, almost as if they were Jet Skis.</p><p>Tram driving’s closest cousin may be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAtKVxzV3Qw" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backhoe rodeo</a>, in which operators perform delicate tasks like placing helmets onto cones using their machines’ hulking yellow claws.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>But while backhoe contests typically attract construction workers, the tram competitions draw public transit fanatics with strong opinions.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Cameras inside the trams caught the reactions of drivers during the competition.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lena Mucha for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“Buses are the worst,” said Nosa Tasslimi, 27.</p><p>How about the metro? “I like subways more than trams, but there are no subway competitions.”</p><p>Mr. Tasslimi even designed a soccer fan-style scarf in support of the team from Oradea, a Romanian city to which he had no obvious connection. He and his friends — who were also not Romanian — wore the scarves with pride.</p><p>Earlier this year, transit systems held internal tournaments to select their 2024 teams. With the exception of Kyiv, Ukraine, every competing city had a male and female representative, said Mr. Stumpf, the championship’s president. (Most Ukrainian men have been barred from traveling internationally during the country’s war with Russia.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><p>Many of the 26 competing teams thought that Frankfurt, as the home team, would have an advantage. But Mr. Stumpf thought those concerns were unfounded, adding that trams are mostly alike in terms of design and control boards. Only one host city — <a href="https://www.tramem.eu/blog/brussels-2019" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brussels, in 2019</a> — has ever won first place.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans cheered on Michael Jakes, a member of the Edinburgh team, as he raced to the finish.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lena Mucha for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The teams spent part of Friday racing back and forth on unused tracks near a depot, getting a feel for their vehicles. For some drivers, it was a little bit like the first few minutes spent adjusting the mirrors and the seat in a rental car.</p><p>“We have been practicing,” said Virendra Mohan, 47, of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “But the other teams have also been practicing, too.”</p><p>Mr. Mohan had been testing his precision stops. But the drivers representing Edinburgh, which was competing for the first time, had trained two hours a week for about six weeks. Dougie White, the team’s coach, rigged up a pool table in the depot. In Frankfurt, they had to get a feel for different pedals, one of which was where the horn would normally be on their trams.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>“That’ll be the biggest challenge for them,” Mr. White said: “Driving a different tram.”</p><p>Vienna, next year’s host, is already brainstorming ideas for the competition. The pressure is on: It could host teams from Asia, the Americas and beyond for the first truly world championship. So far, it’s keeping the details of the next championship largely under wraps.</p><p>Christian Ludwig, an event manager with Vienna’s public transit operator, said he came to scope out ideas. “We are a tram bowling city,” Mr. Ludwig hinted, alluding to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyv03KDZm3Q" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a beloved event</a> that was not included in this year’s rotation. “That I can say already.”</p><p>The tournaments are partly meant to laud the almighty tram, which has the feel of a bus but travels along set tracks with the precision of a subway. They have been embraced by many cities looking to limit cars. </p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-18"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lena Mucha for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lena Mucha for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Mostly, though, the competition is a celebration of the drivers. It’s also an attempt to market the profession.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Cities across Europe are struggling to recruit drivers, Mr. Stumpf said, and the job can be thankless. Commuters rarely acknowledge the drivers’ efforts to ensure the trams are safe, reliable and jostle-free.</p><p>Still, many drivers take immense pride in their work. At the competition, some wore socks bearing their transit company’s logo. A few wore large tram pins. Elinor Svensson, 23, painted her nails yellow and blue, the colors of the Swedish flag.</p><p>“I want my passengers to be impressed,” she said.</p><p>As she loops around Stockholm, she said, she tries to drive so smoothly that her riders take notice. But as a passenger, “you don’t really notice it when it’s good,” she admitted. “You notice it when it’s bad.”</p><p>Ms. Svensson often imagines her riders at work or in classrooms, or perhaps talking to their doctors or friends.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>“If I wasn’t here,” she said, “they wouldn’t get to where they needed to be.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-24"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Andreas Karlsson, left, and Elinor Svensson, center, represented Stockholm at the competition.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lena Mucha for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>That’s part of what made the weekend so joyful. For two days, the drivers were celebrities — of public transit, that is.</p><p>In the end, Budapest came out on top. It was faster, smoother — maybe luckier.</p><p>“We were training hard,” said Ákos Bodnár, 25, a member of Budapest’s team who also won the runner-up award for best driver. “We can’t believe it.”</p></div></div></section></article></div>
