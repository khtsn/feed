		<p>After defeating Xipto Esports 2-0, defending champions Shopify Rebellion have made the top three in the 2024 Game Changers Championship. </p>

<p>The series began on Xipto&#39;s map, Pearl, which Shopify took 13-8 after a comfortable defense half. Xipto put up a fight on their Sunset attack, but a late back-and-forth went Shopify&#39;s way, ending their map pick 13-11 and the series 2-0.</p>

<p>Shopify will next play against G2 Gozen in the upper bracket final for a spot in the grand final, a repeat of 2023 in which Shopify came out on top. Xipto remains in the tournament, and they will next play against KRÃœ Blaze in the lower bracket. </p>

<p><em>This article will be updated with a full recap.</em></p>
