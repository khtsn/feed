Meanwhile, Han Dong-hoon, the chairman of Mr. Yoon’s People Power Party, or P.P.P., has presented himself as the government’s decision maker and said the president is no longer running the country.</p><p>The trouble is that South Korea’s Constitution doesn’t allow for anyone to replace the president unless he resigns or is impeached.</p><p>Mr. Yoon’s office did not comment on Mr. Han’s statement. But Mr. Yoon “has not and by law, cannot, cede power to anyone” except through resignation, impeachment or election, said a senior government source familiar with the discussions inside Mr. Yoon’s office.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Opposition groups immediately complained that Mr. Han was overreaching: trying to use the power vacuum created by Mr. Yoon’s ill-fated imposition of martial law and the ensuing turmoil to establish himself as the top leader in the governing camp.</p><p>“We have a situation where the president cannot make decisions, he cannot give guidelines, he cannot give orders,” said Kang Won-taek, a professor of political science at Seoul National University. “Although we have a president, we are in a state of anarchy.”</p><p>The result was deepening political uncertainty on Sunday, as South Koreans wondered who was in charge of their government, including its military, at a time when South Korea faces multiple foreign policy challenges. Those include North Korea’s growing nuclear threat and the delicate diplomacy needed in its alliance with the United States as the inauguration of Donald J. Trump looms.</p><p>At home, thousands of young doctors have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/world/asia/doctor-strike-south-korea.html" title="">on strike</a> for nearly a year to protest Mr. Yoon’s planned changes to health care policy. Militant labor unions have vowed to escalate strikes until Mr. Yoon is impeached. The country also faces a slowing economy, mounting household debts, low birthrates, unaffordable housing prices and a host of other intractable problems.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A group of trainee doctors and others at a rally in Seoul on Sunday to protest against President Yoon.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Philip Fong/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>The martial law order lasted only six hours from late Tuesday until the National Assembly voted against it early Wednesday, forcing Mr. Yoon to back down. But it prompted waves of protests and calls for his resignation or impeachment.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a last-ditch attempt to survive an attempt by opposition lawmakers on Saturday to impeach him, Mr. Yoon apologized to the nation for his misjudgment. But he didn’t offer to resign, and he left it to his party to decide how long he should remain in office and how the government should be run. In return, his party boycotted the parliamentary vote, saving him from impeachment.</p><p>The ensuing maneuvering by the president, Mr. Han and the rival political parties has created what analysts called a state of chaos: a politically incapacitated president who the opposition says has never intended to step down; an ambitious party leader jockeying to consolidate his power; and an opposition determined to force Mr. Yoon out of office as fast as possible so as to hold a new national election.</p><p>In an announcement Sunday morning, Mr. Han said that Mr. Yoon must resign because he could no longer function as a normal head of state for the remainder of his five-year term, which ends in May 2027. But he didn’t say when Mr. Yoon should step down, only that the country needed time to arrange for him to make an “orderly exit.”</p><p>“Even before he resigns, the president will no longer be involved in state affairs, including diplomacy,” Mr. Han said, without clarifying whether he had the authority to make such a statement. He said that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, a political appointee of Mr. Yoon’s, would run the government in close consultation with the P.P.P.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>That appeared to be a nod to South Korea’s constitutional requirement that only the prime minister can step in as an interim leader until South Korea elects a new president through a national election. But no law defines the president’s “exclusion” from state affairs: his office can be legally vacated only through resignation or impeachment.</p><p>The opposition quickly accused Mr. Han, the party leader, of trying to grab power illegally through “a second insurrection,” adding to the confusion created by Mr. Yoon’s short-lived attempt to place his country under martial rule for the first time in 45 years.</p><p>“He should stop acting as if he were the president,” Yoon Jong-kun, a spokesman for the principal opposition Democratic Party, said on Sunday. “No one — not the people, not the laws of the nation — gave him the power to exclude the president from office.”</p><p>Because President Yoon has not resigned, “impeaching him is the only way to exclude him from office,” he said.</p><p>Cho Kuk, chairman of a minority opposition party and former law professor, accused Mr. Han of attempting a “second coup d’état.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Opposition lawmakers and political commentators said Mr. Han was trying to “buy time,” instead of impeaching Mr. Yoon immediately, to improve his own chances of winning the election to select Mr. Yoon’s successor. A quick impeachment would probably brighten the presidential prospects of Lee Jae-myung, the main opposition leader, who has been a leading campaigner for Mr. Yoon’s ouster, analysts said.</p><p>The opposition parties have vowed to seek Mr. Yoon’s impeachment again, as early as next Saturday. Park Chan-dae, the floor leader of Mr. Lee’s main opposition Democratic Party, said the Assembly would try to vote on his impeachment “every Saturday.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Han Dong-hoon, right, the leader of President Yoon’s People Power Party, and South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo prepared to release a joint public statement on Sunday, a day after the opposition’s bid to impeach the president failed.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Mr. Han, the party leader, had been Mr. Yoon’s most trusted ally until they fell out over how to deal with allegations of corruption involving Mr. Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee. Mr. Han is now Mr. Yoon’s strongest critic within his party. But although he is the party’s chairman, he doesn’t speak for all party members, and it is unclear how much support he has.</p><p>Yoon Sang-hyun, a senior P.P.P. lawmaker, told reporters on Saturday that excluding Mr. Yoon from state affairs was Mr. Han’s “own personal idea,” and that Mr. Yoon should continue to serve as president.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“At a time of political fluidity like this, government officials don’t know whom to listen to,” Prof. Kang said. “Yoon must leave office through resignation or impeachment as soon as possible to remove uncertainty and reduce the risk for the nation.”</p><p>Adding to the turmoil, opposition parties called for Mr. Yoon’s arrest, asserting that the president and his followers in the government and military committed insurrection and other crimes when they sent soldiers and police officers into the National Assembly to try to seize the legislature shortly after Mr. Yoon declared martial law.</p><p>A team of more than 60 prosecutors and investigators have been put together to investigate the accusations, Park Se-hyun, the chief of the Seoul High Prosecutors’ Office, said on Sunday. Earlier Sunday, prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/world/asia/south-korea-martial-law-defense-minister-arrest.html" title="">detained</a> Mr. Yoon’s former defense minister, Kim Yong-hyun, for questioning.</p><p>The current uncertainty raised the critical question of who would give orders to South Korea’s armed forces in case they needed to respond to North Korea, said Lee Byong-chul, a North Korea expert at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.</p><p>“By law, Yoon is still commander in chief,” he said. “If North Korea launches a provocation to test South Korea’s political situation, will he reassert his power as commander in chief? Will that lead to a fight over power?”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Choe Sang-Hun is the lead reporter for The Times in Seoul, covering South and North Korea.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/choe-sang-hun">More about Choe Sang-Hun</a></span></p></div><div><p>Jin Yu Young reports on South Korea, the Asia Pacific region and global breaking news from Seoul.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jin-yu-young">More about Jin Yu Young</a></span></p></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/yoon-suk-yeol">Yoon Suk-yeol</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/people-power-party">People Power Party</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div><ul><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="bottom-sheet-sensor"></div><div><div id="bottom-wrapper"><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href="#after-bottom">SKIP ADVERTISEMENT</a></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
