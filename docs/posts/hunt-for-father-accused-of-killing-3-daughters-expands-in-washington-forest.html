They were found dead on Monday near a campsite roughly 70 miles east of Seattle. Each child had a plastic bag over her head, according to an affidavit from the police in Wenatchee, Wash., where the girls lived with their mother.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Travis Caleb Decker</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Wenatchee Police Department</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Large swaths of wilderness around where the girls’ bodies were found have been closed to the public as the manhunt has intensified. The U.S. Forest Service closed some trails, roads and campsites in the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/r06/okanogan-wenatchee/alerts/icicle-creek-area-closure-wenatchee-river-ranger-district" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest</a>. On Thursday, the National Park Service closed parts of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/news/stehekin-trail-camp-and-area-closures.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lake Chelan National Recreation Area</a>, a part of the North Cascades National Park Service Complex to the north of the national forest.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Friday, Gov. Bob Ferguson <a href="https://governor.wa.gov/news/2025/governor-ferguson-activates-national-guard-resources-search-man-accused-killing-3-daughters" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledged to support the investigation</a> by sending National Guard resources and emergency funding.</p><p>The Spokane County Sheriff’s Office sent two helicopters to assist with the search, and Mr. Ferguson said the state would provide additional choppers. The F.B.I. and U.S. Marshals Service are also helping the local police.</p><p>In a news release on Friday, the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office, the agency leading the investigation, said it had received more than 500 tips from members of the public about Mr. Decker. It added that investigators had reviewed surveillance video and photos, and that dozens more law enforcement officials had arrived to help with the search.</p><p>Mr. Decker, 32, has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping. On Thursday, federal prosecutors also charged him with fleeing arrest. Days before Mr. Decker disappeared with his daughters, prosecutors said he had repeatedly searched Google for information about relocating to Canada. Among his searches were “how does a person move to canada,” “how to relocate to canada” and “jobs canada,” according to court records.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Mr. Decker’s pickup truck was found near the Rock Island campground, not far from where the girls’ bodies were ultimately discovered. A former member of the military, Mr. Decker is believed to be “well versed in wilderness survival and capable of spending days or even weeks in the wilderness on his own and with very little equipment,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>“Although this can be a challenge while searching for him, our personnel are well equipped and prepared to seek and apprehend him,” the office added.</p><p>The girls were reported missing on May 30 by their mother, who is divorced from Mr. Decker. She told the police that she was worried for their safety because Mr. Decker had been experiencing “mental health issues.”</p><p>Officials advised residents in remote parts of Chelan, Kittitas, King, Snohomish and Okanagan Counties to take precautions like keeping their doors locked and their exterior lights switched on. If they see Mr. Decker, they should avoid approaching him and call 911, the sheriff’s office said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alyce McFadden is a reporter covering New York City and a member of the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/newsroom-fellowship/">Times Fellowship</a> class, a program for journalists early in their careers.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
