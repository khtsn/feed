</span>, while XLG automatically retain their spot. DRG is also the third team from China to be eliminated without a win, leaving XLG as the only remaining team to represent the region.</p>

<p>The series commenced on DRG&#39;s pick of <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542214/g2-esports-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-elim-d/?game=233451&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Lotus</a>. Both teams used the same compositions they had shown in their opening matches, with DRG going for double-Duelist and G2 picking Tejo and Fade. Off the back of <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/52904/akeman">
		Akeman	</a>
</span>, DRG got off to a roaring start; the Waylay player found 15 kills in the first eight rounds to secure his team a 6-2 lead despite dropping the second round anti-eco. </p>


<p><em>Akeman charges forward and mows down G2.</em></p>

<p>G2 broke the streak of rounds with a signature Stinger buy win in round 9. From there, they found the answers to DRG&#39;s proactive reclears, recovering to a 6-6 half. Extending their momentum with a pistol round won by <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/4581/jonahp">

</span> in a 1v1 against <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/26171/demon1">

</span>, the North American representatives steamrolled with a near-perfect defense to a clear-cut 13-7 win.</p>

<p>Akeman cooled off after his early performance, ending the map with 20 kills. leaf was instead the one who stole the show, winding up with a 23/12/6 KDA, 193 ADR, and 1.59 rating on Viper. </p>

<p>G2 selected <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/542214/g2-esports-vs-dragon-ranger-gaming-valorant-champions-2025-elim-d/?game=233452&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank">Abyss</a> next, making it both teams&#39; first foray into the map since its return to the pool. DRG carried on with Waylay-Yoru, while G2 surprised with <span data-ref-id="9">
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/player/15500/trent">
		trent	</a>
</span> on Tejo and leaf on Deadlock. This time, G2 led with a 6-2 start of their own, dominating the early buy rounds after nearly losing the second anti-eco. Much like their opponents on Lotus, DRG refused to yield, stringing together four in a row to equalize the half at 6-6. </p>

<p>The second half was all G2—jawgemo came alive, pulling off an impossible Frenzy 1v4 in the pistol round to take it for his team. DRG attempted to fight back in, but G2&#39;s stalwart postplants only widened the gap, enabling them to win Abyss 13-7. jawgemo ended the map with an impressive 23/13/9 KDA and 197 ADR on Yoru. </p>


<p><em>jawgemo silences DRG against all odds.</em></p>
