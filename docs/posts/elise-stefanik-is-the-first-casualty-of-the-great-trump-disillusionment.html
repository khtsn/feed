She had already begun <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/capitol/article/white-house-pulls-stefanik-s-un-nomination-20244277.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a social-media farewell retrospective</a> for her upstate New York district and stepped down from a leadership position, and as recently as Wednesday she <a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1905055783600922865" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a photo of herself</a> with people she presumptuously called her “cabinet colleagues.”</p><p>But all her <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/cpac-2024-elise-stefanik-is-now-a-maga-star.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fawning subservience</a> to the Trump agenda went for naught. “There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/stefanik-trump-cabinet.html" title="">Trump wrote</a> on his social media platform, demonstrating yet again that loyalty to his cause is easily disregarded when there are more pressing and self-serving matters at stake.</p><p>The decision to eject Stefanik from the bus was due not just to House Republicans’ needing her vote in the next few weeks, however. If that were the case, Trump could have kept her in the House until after the budget reconciliation votes this spring and then sent her to the U.N.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Instead, it was most likely because Republicans knew they might struggle to keep her congressional seat in a special election. The warning signs are everywhere: As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/upshot/trump-democrats-politics-elections.html" title="">Nate Cohn of The Times wrote</a> Friday morning, Trump has already blown his post-election honeymoon; more Americans disapprove of his performance than approve of it. A Democrat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/democrat-iowa-state-senate-race.html" title="">flipped an Iowa State Senate seat</a> in January, and in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, another Democrat startled the political world by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/politics/special-election-pennsylvania-state-senate-trump-malone-parsons.html" title="">winning a State Senate district</a> that Trump took by 15 points last November. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/28/stefaniks-withdrawal-suggests-republicans-are-sweating-their-thin-margins-00255984" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Politico reports</a> that Republicans are worried about an upcoming special congressional election in a deep-red Florida district.</p><p>It’s not that voters are suddenly drawn to the Democratic Party, which has yet to coalesce around a message or even a strategy. But as a series of raucous town halls around the country have demonstrated, voters are both angered and disillusioned by the administration’s early priorities. There are dozens of possible reasons: Consumer prices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/business/economy/us-inflation-pce-trump-trade-tariffs.html" title="">have yet to go down</a>, and Trump’s inexplicable love of tariffs is likely to push them up further. The stock market has sunk, along with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/opinion/stock-market-trump-retirement.html" title="">the retirement savings</a> of many voters, and the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/economy/trump-recession-tariffs-inflation.html" title="">seems unperturbed</a> by the prospect of a recession. The administration is doing real damage to middle-class foundations like Social Security, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/15/business/economy/tariffs-trump-maps-voters.html" title="">red states</a> will pay the heaviest price.</p><p>Most voters simply want competence from public officials, and the gross negligence shown by the use of their phones to discuss war plans demonstrates the opposite. They want changes in their lives, not <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2025/03/27/trump-issues-executive-order-eliminate-anti-american-ideology-smithsonian/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changes to the exhibits</a> at the Smithsonian. They aren’t getting that, and Stefanik is one of the first to pay a price for it. There will be many others.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>David Firestone is a former member of the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/opinion/editorialboard.html">editorial board</a> and was a reporter and editor for the Washington bureau and the Metropolitan and National desks.<span> </span> <span> </span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
