A man and a woman were seen rushing into a building with backpacks and assault rifles. Special Forces were deployed, and the police sealed off the area before the government limited local news coverage to official statements. </p><p>Selim Cirpanoglu, the mayor of the district where the attack took place, told Turkish news media that hostages had been taken in a cafeteria in the compound. Late Wednesday, it was not clear how or whether that issue had been resolved.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Speaking to reporters near the site, Defense Minister Yasar Guler also suggested that the P.K.K. had been behind the assault.</p><p>“We inflict the necessary punishment on those ignoble P.K.K. members, but they never wisen up,” Mr. Guler said.</p><p>The P.K.K. has been seeking Kurdish autonomy through a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state that has left tens of thousands of people dead. Turkey and its Western allies consider the P.K.K. a terrorist organization.</p><p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on Wednesday, but Turkey has faced similar assaults in recent years from Kurdish separatists, radical leftists and jihadists from the Islamic State. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>One video from the scene that was shown on Turkish television networks before the broadcast restrictions showed gray smoke from what appeared to be an explosion and a man who appeared to be an attacker running with an assault rifle. Images from surveillance cameras inside a building showed two attackers near the entrance to a building and a body lying on the pavement outside.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Security camera footage showing armed attackers was posted on social media.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">via Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>NetBlocks, a group that tracks internet outages, <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1849105056081068206" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that major social media platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, had been restricted in Turkey.</p><p>Turkish Aerospace Industries was founded to decrease Turkey’s dependence on foreign defense companies and is a major employer that produces parts for airplanes, helicopters, drones and other technologies.</p><p>The attack came a day after one of<span>  </span>the closest political allies of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a televised address to Parliament that Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned head of the P.K.K., could be released if he announced the end of his group’s insurgency.</p><p>Mr. Ocalan is serving a life sentence in an island prison near Istanbul.
