On Tuesday, she briefly registered her displeasure by returning Mr. Self’s slight, responding, “Thank you, Madam Chair,” before proceeding with her remarks.</p><p>But Representative William Keating of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, was not willing to move on. He interrupted to request that Mr. Self repeat his introduction, which he did, again referring to the Delaware Democrat as “Mr. McBride.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“Mr. Chairman, you are out of order,” Mr. Keating fired back. “Mr. Chairman, have you no decency? I mean, I’ve come to know you a little bit. But this is not decent.”</p><p>Mr. Self said it was time to continue the hearing. But Mr. Keating refused to let go.</p><p>“You will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way,” he said.</p><p>With that, Mr. Self then adjourned the session.</p><p>On social media, Mr. Self later explained himself, writing that, “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.” One of President Trump’s early moves of his second term was to sign an executive order that the federal government would only recognize two sexes and that they were not changeable.</p><p>House Republicans moved last year to bar transgender women from Capitol Hill women’s restrooms. And during his testy exchange with Mr. Keating, Mr. Self suggested that his refusal to refer to Ms. McBride as a woman was in line with a “standard” that had been set on the House floor.</p><p>“What is that standard, Mr. Chairman?” Mr. Keating fired back.</p><p>Mr. Self did not elaborate. But House Republicans appear to have established a practice of not referring to Ms. McBride as a woman in official proceedings. In February, when Ms. McBride rose to deliver her maiden floor speech, Representative Mary Miller, Republican of Illinois, referred to her as the “gentleman from Delaware.” Ms. McBride said nothing.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>On other occasions, Republicans presiding on the floor and in hearings have tried to steer clear of the issue, recognizing her as “the member from Delaware,” even though the custom is to refer to lawmakers as “gentleman” or “gentlewoman.” In those instances, Ms. McBride has simply proceeded with her remarks.</p><p>That approach is in keeping with how she conducted herself on her campaign and in her first months in Congress: She prefers to talk about economic issues and rarely discusses or calls attention to her identity. And she generally gives her G.O.P. colleagues the benefit of the doubt when it comes to dealing with her.</p><p>“Honestly, every Republican I’ve interacted with has been warm and welcoming, save for a couple,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/sarah-mcbride-transgender-trump-congress.html" title="">Ms. McBride said in an interview in January</a>.</p><p>She made no public comment on Tuesday about being misgendered during the hearing.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Annie Karni is a congressional correspondent for The Times.
