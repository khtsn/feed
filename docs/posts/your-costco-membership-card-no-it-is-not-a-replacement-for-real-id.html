Still, it is not a replacement for a government-issued form of identification.</p><p>T.S.A. agents would most likely have to take additional measures to confirm your identity, and you could be pulled aside for additional screening.</p><p>If you are about to travel and you don’t have a Real ID, you can get through airport security with a state-issued <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/enhanced-drivers-licenses-what-are-they" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enhanced driver’s license</a>, a permanent resident card (also known as a green card), a valid passport, a passport card or identification for trusted traveler programs like <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Entry</a> and <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NEXUS</a>.</p><p>But don’t leave your Costco card at home. The big-box store has hundreds of locations around the world, and they all take the same membership card.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Talya Minsberg is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Open Up Your World</h2><h3>Considering a trip, or just some armchair traveling?
