That all but guaranteed that the legislation, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/house-bill-migrants-crime-laken-riley.html" title="">passed the House with bipartisan support last week</a>, would make it to President-elect Donald J. Trump’s desk to be signed after he is sworn in on Monday.</p><p>It still must win approval in the Senate in a vote scheduled for late Monday afternoon, just hours after Mr. Trump takes office, and return to the House before heading to the White House.</p><p>The Senate action came after senators spent several days debating changes to the bill, a process that exposed deep divisions among Democrats over immigration as some in the party move to the right following their party’s electoral losses in November. The bill is the opening legislative move for Republicans in a broader push to crack down on immigration and significantly step up deportations, a promise that Mr. Trump made a centerpiece of his campaign.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>It is named for Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a migrant who crossed into the United States illegally from Venezuela and who had previously been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/us/uga-student-death-timeline.html" title="">arrested for shoplifting</a>, but had not been detained.</p><p>Republicans teed it up as the first of several border bills they hope to revive and enact when they cement their governing trifecta on Monday with Mr. Trump’s inauguration. A similar measure passed the House last year but died when the Democratic-led Senate declined to take it up. The G.O.P. also wants to resurrect measures to increase deportations, hold asylum seekers outside the United States and strip federal funding from cities that restrict their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agencies.</p><p>The legislation instructs federal officials to detain unauthorized immigrants arrested for or charged with burglary, theft, larceny or shoplifting, expanding the list of charges that would subject migrants to detention and potential deportation. Senators this week added assaulting a police officer to the expanded list.</p><p>“As elected representatives, our greatest responsibilities are to listen to the will of the American people, to keep the American people safe and secure,” Senator Katie Britt, Republican of Alabama, said shortly before the vote. She repeated a common refrain that the results of the 2024 election amounted to a mandate from voters to crack down on immigration and increase border security, saying, “It is our duty to turn their cries into action.”</p><p>Democrats raised grave concerns about the bill, arguing that it would undermine due process rights for migrants who had not yet been convicted of crimes. They also said it would waste limited resources that federal immigration enforcement agencies could use to apprehend people who have committed more serious, violent offenses.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“We have a long road ahead to address my deep concerns with the way this bill threatens due process and the potential for it to be abused,” Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said on Thursday. She called on her fellow Democrats to demand more changes to the measure, “but more than that, I urge them to demand a serious, bipartisan approach to tackling immigration in an effective, humane way.”</p><p>Still, several Democratic senators, including some who are facing re-election in 2026 or represent states that Mr. Trump carried, backed the bill. Among the 10 who voted in favor on Friday were Senators Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Gary Peters of Michigan, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mark Warner of Virginia, all of whom are to face voters next year. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, whose states Mr. Trump carried in November, also voted to advance the measure, as did Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.</p><p>The bill would also give state attorneys general the right to sue the attorney general of the United States or the homeland security secretary if an immigrant who enters the country illegally goes on to commit a crime that harms the state or any of its residents.</p><p>Immigration advocates have denounced the provision as a covert attempt to let conservative governors and state attorneys general dictate federal migrant detention policies. Republicans on Wednesday killed an amendment proposed by Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, that would have stripped the section from the bill.</p><p>Karoun Demirjian<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of Congress</h2><h3>Here’s the latest news and analysis from Capitol Hill.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Migrant Crime Bill: </strong>The Senate cleared the final major hurdle to a measure that would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/senate-migrant-deportation-bill.html">require the deportation of undocumented migrants accused of minor crimes</a>, after several Democrats joined Republicans to advance it.</p></li><li><p><strong>House Intelligence Committee: </strong>Speaker Mike Johnson appointed Representative Rick Crawford of Arkansas as the panel’s new chairman, a move that was seen as aligning the committee more closely with President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trans Athletes: </strong>A divided House approved legislation that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/us/politics/house-trans-athletes.html">aims to bar transgender women and girls</a> from participating in school athletic programs designated for female students.
