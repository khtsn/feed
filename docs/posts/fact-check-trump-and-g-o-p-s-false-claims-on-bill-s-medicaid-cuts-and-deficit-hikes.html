It is unclear how these would address “waste, fraud and abuse.”</p><p>The single largest source for savings — estimated to be about $280 billion — comes from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/upshot/medicaid-republicans-work-requirement.html" title="">a new requirement for Medicaid recipients</a> to provide proof of employment.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>With the exception of a few state pilot programs, <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/jan/work-requirements-for-medicaid-enrollees" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medicaid eligibility</a> is not and has not historically been tied to employment.
