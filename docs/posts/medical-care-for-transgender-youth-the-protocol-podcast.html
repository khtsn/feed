This is “The Protocol” with Azeen Ghorayshi. Part one, “The Beginning.”</p><p>OK, so where does this story start then, in your mind?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah, so there have always been a small number of young people who have felt this deep disconnect between their inner sense of themselves, as boys or girls, and their bodies — you know, how they’re seen by society. But when it comes to the medical story, and when these kids are actually beginning to interact with the medical community, there’s actually a really clear beginning. And it’s one that pretty much everyone in the field knows about and points to, and it starts in the Netherlands.</p><p>The Netherlands is this small, very socially liberal country. And back in the 1950s, they were among the few countries in the world that were actually treating trans patients, so at this point, just adults, medically.</p><p>So at the time, the mainstream medical establishment really viewed trans people with a lot of suspicion. And so if a trans person came into a doctor’s office, saying that they felt like they were in the wrong body, often those doctors would assess those patients as being mentally disturbed or sexually deviant, or even psychotic. And so if they got any health care at all, it would usually be from an analyst or a psychiatrist.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And those professionals would be trying to convince these people that they —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>They would talk them out of it. I mean, it was sort of corrective, trying to convince them to let go of the idea that they could ever live as the opposite sex.</p><p>But there were a small number of doctors around this time who felt like that approach was actually failing these patients, that it was completely ineffective in addressing the pain that they were feeling. There’s a foundational medical book from around this time on trans medicine that talks about this. One second.</p><p>It says that these patients that were treated with psychotherapy languished and that, quote, “The majority were miserable, unhappy members of the community, unless they committed suicide.” So you know, what some of these doctors were doing at around this time was actually listening to what these patients were saying and believing them that what they needed was to change their bodies. And so these doctors were treating these patients with hormones, giving trans women estrogen so that they developed female characteristics, giving trans men testosterone so they developed male characteristics. And they also performed surgeries.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>Yeah, well, it started — started long ago.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And so by the 1980s, as these treatments were becoming a little less fringe —</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>I just had my PhD, and I became —</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— a clinical psychologist named Peggy Cohen-Ketness started to research how these patients were actually doing.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>— first follow-up study in the Netherlands.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>This is for adults?</p></dd><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>For adults, yeah, yeah. Because the children were — no way that anyone would do something with children.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And she found that while they were still struggling — there was still a pretty high risk of suicide in the group — the vast majority of the patients reported feeling happy about their medical transitions.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>And so I became —</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And at the same time that Peggy was doing this research —</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>But I was also a psychotherapist.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— she also had a clinical practice.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>So when people heard that I knew something about transgender people, I got referrals for adults mainly. But occasionally, there was also an older adolescent among them.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And she started getting a few referrals for younger patients who are 16, 17, and who are saying really similar things as the adult patients — that they had felt they were in the wrong body for as long as they could remember.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>These kids already had a lot of mental health care. They’re functioning quite well.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>But because they weren’t 18, they couldn’t get treatment.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>I thought, that’s a bit silly.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm.</p></dd><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>For years and years, they very well know what they want. But because they don’t have the right age, they have to wait.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And, you know, Peggy knew that there was already all this skepticism about treating trans patients at all, and she knew it was going to be way more controversial if she tried to treat these kids who were under 18.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Adolescence was known to be this period of great flux and identity exploration, and she knew there would be a lot of skepticism about whether they could make a decision like this. But she also saw that not every teenager could handle their distress for a prolonged period of time, that having to wait to get medical treatment could lead to the same dire outcomes that she saw in the adults that she’d been working with. So in her mind, if a 16 - or a 17-year-old was expressing as much clarity about who they are as an 18-year-old, they should be able to get help. So she went to the lead endocrinologists overseeing hormone treatments for trans adults in the Netherlands.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>— and said, can we do something about that age limit? And they said, OK, we can start it a little bit earlier.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And together, they decide they’re going to lower the age that patients can receive hormones from 18 to 16 and actually study it to see if it helps. And what they found was really interesting because —</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>This looked promising, and —</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>The kids who got hormones were doing better psychologically than the adults they’d been treating.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Hmm.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And she thought that part of the reason why was because they had what she called — and she wrote this in the paper — a convincing appearance. She wrote that they could more easily pass in society, because intervening earlier had managed to block some of the effects of their natal puberty before it had fully set in. And so what Peggy was realizing was that puberty was this incredibly critical period in these patients’ lives.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm. Right. A turning point.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah, in their development, I mean, they’re going through these irreversible changes that will be much harder to undo further down the line. And this was becoming even more clear to her as she started to see younger kids —</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>— 14 - and 15-year-olds, and then, an occasional 12-year-old —</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— kids who were in extreme distress, kids who hadn’t yet gone through puberty or were just starting to, and their distress was actually being exacerbated by that, or even by the prospect of going through puberty. So there’s a scientific paper from around this time that talks about how in the years before puberty, these kids would engage with a kind of magical thinking. And it was this belief that one day, they would just wake up and their bodies would finally match the way they felt inside.</p><p>And what Peggy was seeing was that puberty just shattered this magical thinking. And it made these kids feel like their bodies were basically betraying them, that they were actually becoming less and less the way they felt inside. And there was nothing they could do about it.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>But we said, we don’t — don’t give up.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And just as Peggy was starting to recognize the significance of this moment for her patients —</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>And then I came across FG.</p></dd></dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>That’s when a kid walked into her office and offered an unexpected solution.</p></dd><dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>I don’t know exactly how we’ll refer to him.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In 1990, a 16-year-old kid showed up at Peggy’s office.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>In, like, our early emails, we had talked about what his comfort level was with his voice even appearing in this.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>His voice? He knows I’m recording, right?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>He knows you’re recording.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And what Peggy realized when she saw him would transform the field of youth gender medicine. He’s now in his early 50s, and his role in the history of this care has been closely protected. But he did agree to tell us his story.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So we’re coming up on his number.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And that’s how we found ourselves on a quiet street in a European city we’ve agreed not to name —</p></dd><dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Hi.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Hello!</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Hi.

It’s beautiful. The light is so nice.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The walls were covered in bookshelves. The floor was covered in dog toys. And there were cats, too — somewhere, we’d been told.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Can I get you a coffee or tea or something?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Can I have coffee?</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>If you’re going to have something —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>He brought out some coffee, some pastries, and gestured to us to sit at the dining room table.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And what is your comfort level with your name? FG is what we’re sticking with? Yeah. OK.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>FG is not his real name. It’s what he’s called in some of the medical and historical literature about him. And it’s what we’ve agreed to call him to protect his identity.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And I’ve spent my whole life being covert and —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>So.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah. What is your — do you share with people in your professional space and your —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No, I don’t — I —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>You’re just a man in the world.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I try to get away with a murder. I literally don’t tell people that knew me when I was — before my transition. No.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So they don’t know that you played this, like — do you feel like you played a seminal role?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I did.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah, you did.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, that’s one of my bragging rights, right?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I was the first person, so I was like the Guinea pig.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So some people do know that — like, people close to you know —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No, the people that — no, the people that are close to me and the people that need to know or I’ve told —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Oh, then I love to share, because it’s something that — there’s so much that’s happened, and it explains so much of your personality, your character, your decision-making.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>It’s nice to be able to have somebody to talk to about that. But it doesn’t need to be common knowledge.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Because —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>FG asked that we protect many of the identifying details of his life today.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And if you do mention my profession, then kind make it a medical profession rather than —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Very vague.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But he was ready to talk about his experience with Peggy, which was documented in two foundational case reports that she authored. In one of them, she wrote that he had gone on to become some kind of doctor.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I think that was just to show that I’d managed to achieve some kind of level of profession, which is not completely stupid.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>No, but there is this coded, like, well, did he turn out OK? Did he succeed in life?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah. If I was some loser, then that would be another thing they could hitch to the bandwagon.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I mean, I could be a loser anyway, regardless.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>[LAUGHS]:</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I know many normal, like, cis people that are complete losers.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>So — actually, more than —</p><p>Well, but I think — no, no, sorry.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Maybe to start, tell me a little bit about just your life growing up, like early childhood.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>My mother is — well, was English, because she died. My father’s Italian, and they’re quite, um — well, I think my mother was more liberal than my father, because he came from a small village, and he’s Italian. You probably read that in the case report as well.</p><p>But you know, I had more or less — I had a pretty happy childhood. But I was very — I was very aware of my, um, frustrations, which at the time I didn’t see as frustrations. I just didn’t understand. And I just assumed that would itself out.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>When you say “frustrations” and “sort itself out,” you mean, sort of, the things that you were drawn to or the people you were drawn to? Like, what?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Well, in the sense that — being a boy or a girl. [CHUCKLES]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In the first case report, Peggy noted that FG, who was born female, quote, “wished to be a boy from early on.”</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And I was — I remember being five and coming down, and I had to wear, like, a dress thing. And I put a safety pin in between, because I wanted to — I wanted to be like Knickerbockers. And —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Oh, so you put, like —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— two, to connect to the front and back.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, yeah, exactly. Because I was like, why am I wearing — why am I wearing a dress?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>That’s very innovative.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, it’s quite smart. Then, I was. Now, I’m not. But —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>[LAUGHS]:</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And, um, when I had a choice in the matter, I had my hair cut short.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I’ve never had it long again.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Wow.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And so I think my parents just thought I was a tomboy. I was pretty rough and ready and rambunctious, and I tussled. I fought. All my friends were boys — you know, the usual cliche. I did — I played football, blah, blah. I did judo, all these things. But I was quite aggressive.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Because I was very, uh — I guess, in retrospect, very, um, geared at proving myself as, you know — so that we didn’t have to go into the formalities and say, this is who I am, and I was so overwhelming that people just had to deal with me. And half of them didn’t even know if I was a boy or a girl. And that was my protection. But I was not unhappy — when I was little.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>You weren’t unhappy, but it was — was it an expression of frustration? Or was it more just an assertion of —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Up until about 9 or 10, it was an assertion — 11. Up until then, I thought, oh, it’ll still work out. It’ll still work. One day, I’ll wake up, it’ll be fine. And then as I hit 12, 13, and puberty started to set in, I started to get really worried. Because then I was also aware of that, hmm, this is probably not going to work out how I want it to be.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>It’s not going to just disappear.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No. And my parents, up until then, had been pretty good, especially my mum. I was very close to my mum, and which put a little strain on the relationship with my dad, because he was also quite jealous, and I think he didn’t really understand. So then we would often sit around the table and have massive arguments, which is also quite Italian, so it’s very emotional.</p><p>And it wasn’t until I was 11 or 12, and then I started to become really anxious, which just, I think, translated to being even more aggressive, like, even more difficult and demanding and opinionated and axes to grind. And then —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Were you angry?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, I was angry. But like I said, that made me — at school, I talked with my fists. I also talked with my mouth, because I was also very argumentative. But I wouldn’t tolerate anything. And if anyone said anything to me that I didn’t like, I’d smack them. But I would always smack people that were bigger than me —</p></dd></dl><dt>[laughs]</dt><dd><p>which wasn’t —</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Never punched down.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No, exactly, which wasn’t very difficult, because I was small anyway. But, um, no, I was quite explosive, which —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And your friends — were they — you said they were mostly boys?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And was — do you have any memory of it — of anything about your gender coming up with them, or did they just accept you as you were and —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>It did — well, it came up, but probably — and I don’t know what happened behind my back. I don’t care.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I certainly didn’t care. But there was — I met — when I was 12, I met a girl. She was in my class, and she was also a bit of a tomboy. And we became very close very quickly. And it was at that time that the gym lessons were separated to boys and girls.</p><p>So the very first gym lesson where we had to do it, I was there with this person. And I felt such resistance. It felt wrong. I said, I’m not doing this. I’m not doing it. She said, no, I don’t want to do it either.</p><p>And then I — and so I went to the — I said, I want gym on the other side. And they went, OK. And ever since then, I always did gym with the boys, but so did she. And at the time, we both decided that we were boys.</p><p>And I was convinced that she was the same. And she just turned out to be quite a butch lesbian.</p></dd></dl><dt>[laughs]</dt><dd><p>But we didn’t think anything of it. We didn’t feel foolish about doing that. And so it became — I think half of the people were just confused at that point.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>They’re like, what is this? You know? What are they?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>But it is interesting, thinking about that time and what you were saying about your anxiety increasing — that that is when the splitting starts to happen, right? Both with puberty and with school and with —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, exactly.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— when sexuality and everything is — so was that all weighing on you at that time?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I was really worried about what was happening, what was going to happen, because I could see it around me. And I was —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>You mean puberty?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Puberty, yeah. And that was something that I voiced to my parents in the usual prepubescent, adolescent, ridiculous, soppy way of writing poems and leaving notes, hoping that they read them. And then so my mum found one of these really pathetic poems and — which, clearly, I’d left there. And then she addressed it, and she —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you remember, kind of, what the poem said?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>It was along the lines of, uh, you know, if I can just — ugh, if I can just lay down my sword and blah, blah, blah. It was about battling this life and not being able to see a way out. And I think it was like with the undertone of suicide, but it wasn’t at all. It wasn’t at all. I can’t remember the exact, but it was — I think I blocked it from my memory.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>So that was the general sense of it — that I was feeling hopeless and desperate and blah, blah, blah, blah.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The first case report on FG treated this note with significance. Peggy, still using female pronouns to refer to FG in the report, wrote, “When she was 12, her mother found a suicidal note telling that she did not want to live any longer if she would enter puberty.”</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Did your mom react in the way that you wanted, which was to —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, yeah. Because she took it very seriously. And also my aunt, bless her, who did nothing but lie in bed and read — but read a lot — she happened to have just read a book on transsexuality. And she sent this to my mum and a couple of others. She goes, don’t you think that this might be what is the case? And I guess my mum thought, yes. So, made an appointment with a psychologist, and I started talking to her.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And so you were 12, so that would have been ‘86?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Was your body changing? Were you —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>It was changing, but it was just, like it was prepubescent. And I can’t remember how long I was in conversation with this psychologist, but she put me on to Delemarre —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>— who sadly has passed away.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In that first report, Peggy explained the events that led up to FG showing up at her office. He had been to see a prominent endocrinologist named Henriette Delemarre-van de Waal. She specialized in kids with issues relating to puberty.</p><p>Some of these kids had what’s called precocious puberty, where it started too early, like seven or eight years old. And the treatment that Henriette would give these kids was a monthly injection of a drug that would stop that from happening by blocking the release of the hormones that trigger puberty — a puberty blocker. And when she eventually stopped giving the drug to these kids, puberty would proceed as normal.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>So I went to see her, didn’t have a clue who she was. And she, um, listened to my case. I think Louis Gooren came into it as well, who’s also just died. And —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Who was also —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, yeah, he was the father of the whole gender team.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>For adults, right?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah, came up with, like, basically — was a pioneer worldwide for adult care.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Exactly, exactly. So they evaluated me, and then they decided that I would be a good candidate. No, they — well, I was the first to put on blockers.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Had they — did they come up with the idea in response to meeting you? Is that your sense?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yes, that is my sense. Only because I was the first, and because I was so convincing.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And I’m not sure if the conversation had come up that, well, normally, what we do is, when you’re 16 or 17 — because I think that was when they started putting — the youngest age you could put your hormones in. And I was like, no, I’m not doing it. Why can’t we just — I think probably said, why can’t we just pause it now and just let me be?</p><p>So yeah, I just wanted to wake up and — that’s what I said — I just want to wake up, and I want to have been that I was born a boy, full stop, so that my history was congruent with that narrative. And I didn’t want to have to explain myself, because that made me feel weak, in hindsight, and it made me vulnerable. And my whole life, I was not about being vulnerable. So yeah, in a nutshell, that was probably — I just analyzed it. That’s probably what it was.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And so they — so they took me seriously, and I think they said, well, this is such a bloody convincing case. Great idea to experiment on this child.</p></dd></dl><dt>[chuckles]</dt><dd><p>My parents were behind it.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>They were?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So, I mean, you used the word “Guinea pig” earlier. Were they —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Aware?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— aware?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Don’t think so.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>You don’t think they were aware it was the first — you were the first?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, no, I don’t think I was aware I was the first.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Really? Oh, wow. OK.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>But, I mean, it wasn’t completely new, because these hormone blockers were being given to kids that were entering precocious puberty — and in the East Bloc countries, for gymnasts, but we don’t talk about that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>[LAUGHS]:</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>So there is some kind of data there, right?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Or at least clinical experience.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Clinical — yeah, exactly.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Peggy’s report was matter-of-fact in talking about the significance of this moment. She simply wrote that the case is the first we know of in which a young person struggling with their gender had been given this drug. The report doesn’t note the unexpected way in which it had come about — with a doctor who hadn’t even been working with trans kids.</p><p>Henriette Delemarre-van de Waal died in 2014, but her husband told us that he doesn’t think she saw this as some revolutionary act. This was a drug she was already using with her other patients. She understood the side effects.</p><p>She saw a kid who was really hurting, and after consulting her colleagues, she decided that this might help. He doesn’t think that she had any idea, really, how transformational this would turn out to be, to use this drug in this whole new way with FG.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you think that would have scared you out of it?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No, because there was an alternative.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>It was sort of irrelevant?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah. It was like, otherwise, I’m leaving. I’m leaving this world — which I wasn’t, but it was that kind of, that — that was like —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>The feeling was there.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>It was like, there’s no choice. We have to do something. This is not OK. I’m not doing this.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I was putting my foot down.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No, I could be very pigheaded. [CHUCKLES]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>So no, I’m not doing it. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. So, puberty, that was.</p><p>I mean, it literally saved my life. So I feel indebted.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So, sorry — so you — so you started the blockers at 12.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah. 12 or 13.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Uh-huh. Do you remember the first time getting it and —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I just — yeah, I do, and it hurt. Because there’s — you injected it into a muscle. And because I was also so, so body-critical, I didn’t want them to inject it into my bum, which is the much better option. So I had it done in my leg the first time, and that hurt like a motherfucker.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And had you met Peggy?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No. Yeah, no. No, I met her — I think I got into conversations with her when I was about 16.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>When he was 16, FG was referred to Peggy’s office. He had been on blockers for several years. And during that time, he had remained certain about his desire to transition to live as a boy.</p><p>So the next step would be to go off the blockers and onto hormones — in his case, testosterone — a step that was only available because Peggy and Louis had lowered the age from 18 to 16. But the report noted that his parents were, quote, “not happy with the idea of sex reassignment,” and that for FG, the prospect of being forced to resume female puberty was creating so much distress, that ultimately, his general practitioner sent his family to Peggy.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, I had to do a lot of psychometric and psychological testing anyway at various points in time. And I remember doing it with Peggy. I filled in a lot of paperwork. [CHUCKLES]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah, yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>A lot of questionnaires and —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Once he started seeing Peggy, he underwent several assessments. Peggy talked in her report about the results of his IQ test, his personality tests, a Rorschach test. She mentioned he went through several therapy sessions, and so did his family. And he also attended group therapy sessions with peers. When she concluded that there were no psychological issues that might interfere with his decision, she recommended he begin hormone treatment.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And then I decided I didn’t want to go onto them until I finished school.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>OK.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Because —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Why —</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Because I didn’t want to have to explain myself. Now, I just — I had frozen time. And if I went onto hormones — which is very paradoxical, because on the one hand, all I wanted to do was go on male hormones. I just didn’t want to have to explain it to people.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Because, again, it would make me vulnerable. And why do I have to explain myself to you? You mean nothing to me. Well, they did, but you know what I mean. It just puts you in a very vulnerable position.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I’ll never know how it would have been if I — If I’d said, hello, well, this is what’s going to happen — stand up in class, like, out yourself. I don’t want to do that. I never wanted to do that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>So I chose not to.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And maybe that’s my own little hang-up. But that’s just pretty much how I went through life.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>[INAUDIBLE]</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And when you —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>For FG, the pain he was feeling was similar to what Peggy had seen with her adult patients. It wasn’t just that he felt he was in the wrong body. It was also that the world saw him as something he felt he wasn’t.</p><p>Peggy noted this in her report. She said that the idea that people around him would see him as someone who used to be a girl but was now a boy was, quote, “shameful.” So rather than go through this transition in front of his classmates, FG decided to stay on the blockers an extra two years, meaning his body essentially remained frozen in his 13-year-old state until he was 18. Then, after high school, he took a year off to begin hormone treatments and go through male puberty as privately as he could.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I think that year was a bit stressful, to be fair, because you have this kind of underlying stress, a stress with phones. Because you’d answer, and you didn’t want to be considered a woman because you had a high voice, but at the same time — so that’s always a — that always stressed me out, especially when I — as your voice started to change, it just became difficult. Because, well, how are they addressing you now? So it was — you’re always thinking about those things — plus toilets. But —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Even going to the clinic to get his hormone treatments was a stressful experience.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>I spent my whole time just sneaking in, I felt. I didn’t want people to point me out as, oh, that’s somebody that’s going to — ‘cause I just didn’t want to be seen.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right, right.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>After a year on testosterone, he was ready to start university as a man.</p></dd><dl><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>But there is still that transition of old life, new life. Who am I going to run into? What do I have to say? I’ve — even at university, I ran into people that were from my school.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And I remember the one thing I said — I met this guy, and he was a year below me. And of course, he knew who I was. And he goes, oh, blah, blah, blah, and my voice is lower. And I went, oh, by — one thing — don’t say “she” to me. And that was the only thing I said to him, and that was it. We never talked about it again.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Wow.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>But there were a few dicey situations with somebody else that was — it’s amazing how small the world is, that some things got back to other people, and they confronted me with it, and I just laughed it off and pretended that I even — I made it ridiculous, because I said, oh, what, you think I want to be a girl? I just turned around, and these people were so confused that they dropped it. But that was pretty — you’re always — in the back of your mind, you’re always worried about these things, especially then. Because why do I want people to view me differently? That’s my whole thing. Then people start to look at you differently. I’m like, no, that’s exactly what I don’t want people to do, or feel that they have a special bond with me because they know something about me, which, at the same time — it’s OK, but at the same time, by saying that, you’re saying it’s a weakness. That’s what you’re saying. And they can use it against you whenever they like, even though it’s like faulting me for being small, which people still do. It’s still used as a weakness.</p><p>Like, it’s not my fault I’m small. What do you want me to do about it? It’s not something that I’m responsible for. I’m responsible for how smart I am, what I’ve done with my life. So you’re the loser.</p></dd></dl><dt>[chuckles]</dt><dd><p>But not about how I was born into a body that didn’t belong to my mindset. And the only thing I can do is deal with it and be successful at it.</p><p>[THUD] Oh.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>That was — [CHUCKLES]</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Right then, one of FG’s cats fell off a window ledge.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I saw it, yeah. [CHUCKLES]</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>No, so anyway, so I have a lot to say about — but at the time, fuck off, I don’t feel like — why do I even have to have these thought processes? I’ve already got my defense ready if it ever came up. Because, no, I will not be treated in a different way or have the idea that you feel superior because, oh, poor you, you know. Fuck off. That hasn’t actually happened. But I’m — just to give you an idea of how my mind works.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Well, that’s valid. What you went through as an adolescent is still with you.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Oh, absolutely. And that’s what’s formed me, and that’s how — that’s why I said, I’d never seen myself as a victim. But I do feel that I should get some credit for something, which — but obviously, I can’t, because then I’d have to put myself out as a victim.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>But you know, it is a big deal. No, it’s like, oh, be the martyr. You know, in my first year at university, I had three operations. Nobody knew about it.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Wow.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And I completed my first year with flying colors.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Wow.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And I didn’t think anything of it. And then, all the years to come, I was in and out of hospital with operations, and even a complication, where I had to rush myself off to hospital because I couldn’t pee anymore.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Oh, my god.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>And — but nobody had a clue. And then I had to make a story around that. And I thought, god damn it, I did all that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>But I can’t say that. Do you know what I mean?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah. I guess just this idea of wanting, your whole life, to blend in and blending in — and there’s been such a sea change in views and attitudes towards gender since the ‘80s. So many of the young people now want to visibly challenge the binary and — I don’t know, what do you make of that? And what do you make of what that means for getting the medical treatment that you pioneered? I mean, you know?</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah, I think it’s a difficult question, because I do know I have a very strong opinion on that, but that’s my opinion, because it’s also fed by my own story. And I try to make the distinction between being — coming from that particular narrative and being narrow-minded.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>My conclusion now is that I find that it’s gone — it’s gone a bit extreme to the other side, so it makes a laughing stock of what it’s really about. Or at least, it seems to be a fashion statement nowadays. And it’s like when you were — in the ‘70s, you were a punker. In the ‘80s, you were a punker, too.</p><p>We always to — we have to fight against something. We need to — we’re forging our identities as young people, so we need to stand out. We need to have an opinion against the given society, because that’s our rite of passage. And it feels like this has become another forum for that, that it’s just taken over that role.</p><p>And for the group that is pure, like proper transsexuals, this flirting with pronouns and gender identity — it’s insulting. Because like I said, we spend all our time trying to just fit in or be able to live the life that we feel we should have had. And it’s not a great help when you’ve got people shouting from the barricades and trying to give you a different position, a third sex or whatever, and then talk about things that we don’t want you to talk about, so that they can identify you.</p><p>But maybe that’s my own — I’m still stuck in my own paradigm. And maybe that shouldn’t be a taboo. Maybe we should break it open. And I don’t know. That’s not how I feel, but I can intellectually — I have to think about that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>But I don’t take a lot of these people that seriously, because it does seem to be a bit of a fashion statement.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>It’s just interesting to me, because you were once an adolescent who adults chose to take seriously.</p></dd><dt>fg</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So this is how it all started — with a kid who only ever wanted to wake up and have it be that he was born a boy, and to never have to explain himself to anyone. He wasn’t the first kid to feel that way, but through some combination of his conviction, the place and time, and the doctors who took him seriously, he was the first kid to get this revolutionary medical intervention.</p><p>FG was 24 years old when Peggy published her first case report on him. It was 11 years after he’d started blockers, and six years after he’d begun hormones and had his first surgery. Peggy wrote that FG, quote, “reported no gender dysphoria at all. He said that he had found the adjustment to the male role to be very easy and expressed no doubts on the adequacy of his masculine behavior.</p><p>He never felt any regrets about his decision and had never contemplated to live as a girl again.” In conclusion, Peggy said, “For certain selected cases with a lifelong, consistent, and extreme gender identity disorder, delaying puberty may be a physical and psychological beneficial way to intervene.”</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>Because of him, we thought maybe we should do this more often — giving the blocking hormones.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Because of FG, Peggy thought that more kids could benefit from what had clearly been a transformational treatment for him. And she thought that the benefits of puberty blockers were twofold. They could prevent young bodies from growing in an undesired direction. They also made it possible for kids to consider, without that stress, whether they wanted to go on to the next steps, which would be irreversible.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>— give them more space and time to think about the decisions.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She felt the blockers would give kids time to think. But to give this treatment to more kids, Peggy felt they needed a process.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>You cannot just start and do whatever we want, particularly at the beginning, when you have no idea whether what you’re doing is OK.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She began to codify a protocol — what would come to be known as “the Dutch protocol.”</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>How would you define the Dutch protocol?</p></dd><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>Well, I think it’s a very careful way to figure out who should have what kind of treatment to feel like they want to feel.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And the critical part of that protocol was a process for assessing the kids to figure out who should receive medical intervention, which kids would benefit from it and not come to regret it.</p></dd><dl><dt>peggy cohen-ketness</dt><dd><p>Because we didn’t want to have all kinds of disasters right from the beginning. But in much of these decisions, knowing the kids was very helpful. You just see what’s happening. I mean, look at FG. [CHUCKLES]</p><p>If you see how well they are doing, you know it could not be completely wrong. It’s just that exactly what you have to do with what kid — that’s the challenge.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In the early 2000s, Peggy moved her work to Amsterdam, to the biggest transgender medical program in the country, and she started to put together a team of mental health providers to assess and treat the kids coming into the clinic, including a psychiatrist named Annelou de Vries.</p></dd><dl><dt>woman</dt><dd><p>And what’s your name?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>My name is Azeen Ghorayshi.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And what happened next would explain how this care that started almost by accident with this one kid would quickly spread around the world.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Hello.</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Hi, good to see you.

At that time, Peggy was still developing her set of rules for providing this new medical intervention to young people, what came to be known as the Dutch Protocol, puberty blockers, when puberty started, usually around 12, hormones as early as 16, and surgeries in adulthood, and critically, the mental health assessments that were designed to help figure out which kids should get medical intervention.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>That assessment was a several sessions over a longer period of time, and actually, really get to know the family, get to know the kids. Yeah.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And how long, typically, would you say you spoke with them?</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>So it takes at least half a year. But what we say — we take the time we need. So you cannot pinpoint me on how much time we have.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Like, kids might need more than that.</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And over time, as a growing number of kids were being referred to the clinic —</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>It was obviously a radical new idea, a new option. What were your concerns and questions you wanted to answer?</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Well, yeah, of course, we needed proof of the effectiveness of the treatment.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Annelou started to study the kids they were treating.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>What research had been published by 2003 when you started working with the group?</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>There was the case publication and —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>The case study?</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>At that point, there wasn’t any data to support using puberty blockers for kids with gender dysphoria. There was Peggy’s case report on FG, but that was just an account of a single kid who had been given the blockers before the Dutch Protocol even existed. There was no way to know how well they would work for other kids, or what risks there might be.</p><p>So Annelou set out to look at a group of patients who were getting the treatment at the clinic, what ended up being 70 patients over the course of the study.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>That’s the 2011 study.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>The famous —</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Yeah well, that was the first one that did some evaluation of, really, the medical intervention.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>The Dutch Protocol.</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>The Dutch Protocol.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The idea was to see how the kids were doing psychologically before they started puberty blockers, and follow up with them over time to see how the blockers and then hormones and surgeries impacted their well-being, and whether the kids they thought would benefit from the treatment actually were doing better. And what Annelou found launched the field of youth gender medicine.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>In general. I think people were convinced, yeah, this is so clear-cut if you look at this. Yeah.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Annelou got up and led us to her nearby office and dug around her shelves.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>I still have one —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Oh, wow, it’s a big book.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She pulled out an enormous coffee table book. On the cover, it said, “Genderkinderen,” “Gender Kids.”</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Wow.</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>So these were the very first children that were treated here. They called themselves Gender Kids. “I have gender” was — because the whole word “gender identity disorder” was too complicated. So they just said, “I have gender.”</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Wow. Are these patients that you saw?</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She flipped through. It was filled with full-page color photographs of some of the kids who took part in her research.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>So, for example, Manon —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And she pointed to one kid in particular —</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Manon is the one who wants to talk.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— someone who could help us understand how the Dutch Protocol worked —</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>This is Manon. Yeah, and she’s now 30, I think.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— what it was about this process and the kids who went through it, that was so convincing to the rest of the world.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd><dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So I guess we should find a car to go out —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>No. I’ll do it.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>From “The New York Times, I’m Austin Mitchell. This is “The Protocol” with Azeen Ghorayshi.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>We’re going to meet her at her house and hear about her life with actually going to that clinic, probably far in the rear-view mirror. So it’ll be interesting.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Part two.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>All right. Thank you very much.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>“The Gender Kids.”</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>So we’ll just sit on the table and have just a conversation, and you will just record it.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah, and if there’s anything that you’re — don’t want to be public or that —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>There are not a lot of people in Manon’s life who know the role she played in Annalou’s study.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Have you ever talked to the media before?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, when I was a kid and with the book. But later, I worked with a Dutch program.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But as one of the first kids to go through the Dutch Protocol, she’s had some experience with the media, including one where she said her full name was published without permission.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>It did happen that I had a new job, and someone googled me. Then I heard, later that, oh, your video is going through the whole company. So that was very unsafe. That was not nice.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So we’ve agreed to use only her first name.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>And I thought — also, I believe that if Annelou speaks with you, then it’s, for me, safe to also speak with you. Yeah, I did want to —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I mean, I want to hear your whole life story, getting into everything, meeting Annelou.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah. I can remember. It was literally Wednesday afternoon, a few hours, and they were with a few colleagues, Peggy, Annelou, and the other doctor, and I think another few. So it was all very small. And I did realize I was a — yeah, how do you call it? Yeah, we say [DUTCH], a trial —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Oh, like a —</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>A rabbit that they test —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Oh, guinea pig.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, like where they test things on. So yeah, they have to test it on someone. Well, yeah, fine by me. Yeah.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Manon’s experience going through the Dutch Protocol along with the other kids Annelou studied, was captured in a handful of papers. There was Annelou’s seminal study. There were also a few other scientific articles that outlined in detail how the protocol worked.</p><p>And what Annelou made clear in these papers was that clinicians who worked with gender-dysphoric kids shouldn’t push for any particular treatment outcome. The primary goal was to help them function better so that they could go to school, get along with their friends and family. And for some kids, that might not mean medical intervention. That was about 30 percent of the kids they saw.</p><p>Annelou wrote that some of the kids who came in were gay, and thought that transitioning might help them feel more accepted. Others had psychological issues that needed to be dealt with first.</p><p>She also talked about kids with autism-spectrum disorder, which was about 10 percent of the kids referred to the clinic. She explained in one study that for these kids, quote, “It can be complicated to disentangle whether the gender dysphoria evolves from a general feeling of being just different, or whether a true core cross-gender identity exists.”</p><p>Annelou said that in all of these cases, kids should get psychological counseling. But in order to get medical intervention —</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>What was your early childhood like? Did you gravitate towards different friends or —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— kids had to meet a certain set of criteria.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— from my mother that, on a very, very young age, I — maybe three years old — I did not understand why my cousin had long hair and I did not.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The first thing that was mentioned in all the papers was an early history of what, at the time, was called gender identity disorder. So from a very young age, kids had to have a strong identification with the opposite sex, as well as a persistent discomfort with their sex at birth.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— always walking in my mom’s clothes, wearing towels as skirts or long hair. I wanted to play with girls’ stuff. And then — yeah, she always said, yeah, but you’re a boy, and you have a penis. And then I said, no, I’m not a boy. I’m a girl. And the penis will fall off. I always believed that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you remember —</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I can also remember — I don’t know if it’s also in the USA. But in Holland, if you don’t close the zipper from your trousers, they say, oh, then it will fly away. So I always walked with my zipper open. And I was so convinced that something was wrong and it will get fixed. Then I came the —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Realization?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— realizing that it will not fall off or fly away. Ah, shit, it’s not going to fly off. And I am a boy, but I do not feel like one. And then I really did everything to be the best boy in the world. So I had this sharp hair with the gel and very boy clothes. And I climbed trees and hit people and was fighting.</p><p>So my mom said, I saw that you were so struggling being a boy, literally. So I can also remember the phase that I was very — really, really unhappy, and that I really said that — I said, oh, I will cut it off. Then they have to help me. My parents were really scared that I would maybe hurt myself.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>In terms of how your parents reacted, were they steering you back towards boy things and trying to just —</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Well, I think they let me very free. I was really raised with, everything is OK. And I think I always had a very strong, intuitive connection with my mother.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Another part of the criteria Annelou wrote about in her papers was that kids had to have the support of their parents or other caregivers.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— that moment, I think, for my mother was, OK, we have to do something and help you. But also very — very open, also, from, OK, are you sure that this is what you want? Are you sure that you want to go outside as a girl? Do you know that you will be bullied, that people will have an opinion about you? It gives me chills when I say it. But very open with me. Nearly like an adult conversation, but I was eight years old. So if I see —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Annelou wrote that family support mattered because, quote, “Parents can play a significant role in creating an environment in which their child can grow up safely and develop optimally.”</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>I went with my mother. And we went to the H&amp;M, bought loads of clothes, and my first like small heels and girls clothes.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In Manon’s case, her parents had started to let her dress as a girl when she was in elementary school.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>So as soon as I came out of school, curtains closed, and then I changed, and I think I changed every day, 10, 15 times.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>[LAUGHS]: And you would just put on different outfits?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>I was so happy, yeah. Also, my dad said, a while ago, you were looking in the mirror the whole day.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>At first just at home —</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>And then shortly after —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— and then in public.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>I said, I want to go to my friends. Her name was Brenda. And — to show the new me, I was really —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Manon remembers going to her friend’s house nearby. It was just on the other side of a playground where the neighborhood kids hung out.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>It felt like not a nice place because it was very vulnerable there. All the kids — and kids are harsh, and yeah, we were —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>That day, she used a back alley, so none of the other kids saw her on the way there.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>And then my mom said, if you want, later, I can pick you up, and then we can walk together through the playground. She said, think about it. If you want it, call me. And I thought, yes, I want that.</p><p>So my mom picked me up, and she held my hand, and we walked.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And you were in your clothes.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, I was as a girl. And then we walked outside and — with my head up high. And everyone was outside and watching. And yeah, everyone was, like, in shock.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>But you felt there was something —</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Oh, it was so — yeah, that finally, I looked how I felt. And also, the strong hand from my mother, and very protected. It was a very, very special moment, but also the moment of, OK, we’re out now, and we’re going for it.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But when Manon first got to the gender clinic —</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, we went there. And in the beginning, they were very lay —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Hands-off?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Hands-off, yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Because you were so young.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>So young. They said, OK, don’t stimulate. Don’t force anything.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Her family was told to slow down, to not do anything that might influence her.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>We see a lot of children who say it, and later on, they make a different decision. And —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>In the US, the Dutch method was called watchful waiting. So it was — a lot of the kids, by puberty, might change their minds. So wait as long as you can, till puberty.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>What Annelou explained in her papers was that when gender dysphoria started in early childhood, it could change, and some kids would grow out of it. The important milestone, according to the Dutch Protocol, was puberty.</p><p>To be eligible for medical intervention, the distress needed to be intensifying as puberty neared. But Annelou said that for most kids, their distress would dissipate around that time, and because of that, they should keep options open for as long as possible.</p><p>So while it was OK to try out wearing different clothes at home or on vacation, kids shouldn’t fully socially transition until the early stages of puberty, in part because if they changed their mind, they could avoid having to make the transition back.</p><p>And so that’s the guidance that Manon and her parents were getting from Peggy and her team.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And so that was uncomfortable?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, and my mother — because we had such a strong intuitive connection, she was very, no, I know my child, and this is not something from yesterday. And we are not these parents who prefer a daughter or something. No, it’s not the case. So later on, we came at Annelou.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>It was around this time that Annelou joined Peggy at the clinic to help lead the assessment process.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>In the beginning, it was only questions, questions, questions.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Oh, so the evaluations — assessments.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Assessments.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She wrote that the process was designed to track how a child’s gender dysphoria developed over time —</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— how do you feel? How are you at school?</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— and to rule out any other psychological issues or things going on in their life that might be another explanation for their distress.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>A lot of questions, but my dad really can remember very well what really made impacts on him. A lot of children who are sexually abused, like a small girl is abused — they can also have these feelings, that they prefer to be a boy, with the feeling that, oh, if I were a boy, the person did not abuse me, or — yeah.</p><p>So my dad really can remember that they asked me, a few times, different ways, if I was also sexually abused, if my dad touched me strange or my granddad or — and he thought that was really heavy, and also that he had meetings on his own, together with my mother or my mother on her own.</p><p>So yeah, he said sometimes it felt like an investigation on us as parents. But he thought that was very worth it, of course. But I think it was around one year that we — they got — we received the diagnostization.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>The diagnosis?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, the diagnosis, gender dysphoria. And then it was more like, OK, we just keep in touch. We follow up.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>At this point, Manon was a strong candidate for puberty blockers. She had felt gender dysphoria from a very early age. She had a supportive family. She didn’t have any other psychological issues that needed to be addressed first. And crucially, as she approached puberty, her dysphoria was not going away. And so, as she was nearing 12 years old —</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>So then I can remember we went like in the next phase of the treatment,</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Manon started having a new conversation with Annelou —</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>We talked about puberty blockers and also, again, all the questions again —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— because the last part of the criteria kids needed to meet to start medical intervention was making sure that they understood the impact the treatment would have on their lives. The papers talked about blockers as a reversible treatment, so if a kid were to stop taking them, they would eventually resume their natal puberty. But the papers also noted there may be risks to pausing what’s usually a time of rapid growth, like the impact on bone density and possibly brain development.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>It was really very heavy, and very big. Yeah, we felt really serious about it also.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And as Manon was learning about the blockers, she was also being monitored for any signs of puberty.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>They tested my blood every month, if I made testosterone. And I can remember that one day, we got a telephone. Yeah, we found testosterone, so you can start the puberty blockers.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And finally, when she was 12, she began getting monthly shots that paused her development.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>But it was always very clear to me, when I started, that if I ever thought different or changed my mind or did not feel well about it or — you can stop whenever you want, and everything will start as normal, maybe a bit later. But I always knew it was temporary. I always knew that, until the next phase where the hormones, I could stop every moment.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>This is what the Dutch thought of as one of the radical innovations of the blockers, that it was just a pause that could be undone. And meanwhile, Manon could think about what came next.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>But I was so happy with it because I was very aware that I did not want anything to do with male puberty, with wet dreams and beards and — yeah. It felt like a gift. And I was also very aware —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Over the next four years, Manon kept getting her shots —</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— take my blood, I think, every two or three months.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— going into the hospital all the time for tests.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— MRI scans, bone structure scans.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>At some point, she remembered, there were some concerns about her bone health. She said she was told to eat more cheese and exercise. And then she turned 16, the age when doctors at the clinic said she could decide if she wanted to move on to cross-sex hormones. For Manon, this would mean taking estrogen, which would trigger female puberty.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>So again, oh, how are you? How are you feeling? Are you aware — because this is the stage that you will get breasts or your body will change.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And so now the conversation was about whether to move forward to a stage where treatment would have irreversible effects.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— and very important, my fertility?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right, yeah.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah. And I can remember that I got the question — I really had to literally sign a form that I’m aware that, as soon as I start — that my fertility will go. And do you want children, someone asked me. It could be Annelou or someone else. I said, [FLUBS LIPS]: I don’t know. I’m 16, because in this phase and fertility. And I said, OK, what’s the other option? Well, the option was that I then had to quit the blockers for at least six months.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>If Manon wanted to keep the option of having biological kids down the line, she would have had to go off the blockers, delay the estrogen treatment, and let her body go through enough male puberty for her to develop and bank sperm.</p></dd><dl><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Then go back to the hospital. And I saw this room in front of me with the dirty —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Magazines?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>— magazines. And then I could do a thing — what I never did, because I — it made me sick to even think of it. Mastur — how do you call it?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Masturbate?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, masturbate in a — hell, no. Yes. I said, hell, no. So I signed. And, yeah, to be honest, now, do I regret that choice? No, but it does have impact on my life. I’m now 30. Everyone around me is pregnant or has children or — and of course, I think it’s a very normal age that you think, oh, shit, I would also like kids or be a mom or anything. So do I regret the choice? Absolutely not. But it was a very big decision with impacts, now, still on my life.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right, yeah. It is such a nuanced thing that you’re describing, is both saying, I don’t regret it. I know I made the right choice. But also that there can be a part of it that is difficult for you.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, and we were always like, OK — when I was 12 puberty blockers. Then the next phase was 16 — yes, hormones, next step. And my endpoint was, oh, when the operation — I’m done, finished. basta. I’m a woman. I’ll never tell someone again. And I’ll live my life. And I will do everything — what all my friends did when they were 12, 13, 14. I will just do it when I’m 18, with boys and experience and sex and all the things. I literally just put my life on pause.</p><p>So in the end, when the point came that, oh, I’m now done — you’re never done. I mean, it’s not so easy, then, to press Play and, oh, let’s go and take a guy home and have the first-time sex. No, that’s really difficult.</p><p>I’m so scared to be hurt by someone because I built, as a small child, such a big wall as defense. And literally, if someone stick a finger out, I took the whole arm, and I broke it. I did that literally once. So —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>[LAUGHS]:</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah. And so it’s helped me, the defense, and made me strong. But I still have that, naturally, in me, the wall, the brick wall, the, I have to be strong. I have to be tough. I have to fight for myself, for my rights, for my — yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>It’s hard to be vulnerable.</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Very, yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>It’s so funny you talking about boundaries and walls, because I’m a reporter. I talk to people all the time. And you are so open and so evocative about just your life experience. You feel it, and you communicate it. And are you out as trans? Or do some people just — I mean, obviously — who has to explain themselves to every single person they meet, but at work and —</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>No, I will not say I’m fully out. But yeah, to be honest, I do not have to tell anyone. Without being arrogant, you could not see it. You do not hear it. No one will ever, if they meet me, think, oh, she’s transgender or — yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I mean, the gift of the intervention that the Dutch came up with is that if you do interrupt that early block puberty. You never went through any of the changes, that would make it more difficult, maybe, down the line. I mean, do you have other friends who are trans women who didn’t go through the child —</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, my other best friend.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And how do your experiences differ?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, very different because you see it, maybe. Or you hear it a little on her. And yeah, she works in a restaurant. A few weeks ago, a guest asked, are you a guy or a woman, or do I need to call you Miss or Him? She totally freaks out and cries. And yeah, I never have that, never. That’s so hurting. Just because people know, they hurt you with that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right. So when you think back on being able to go through this as a kid, if you imagine a life where you couldn’t and had to wait till later, do you think —</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>That would be horrible. That would be a nightmare. I cannot even imagine. Yeah, I think maybe I did not even live. Yeah, I think I would maybe hurt myself or — yeah, I think so. Because of our treatments that I, luckily, could get, I can live my life now how I live it. A normal job. I have a good background. I just enjoying life.</p><p>So — going out for dinner, parties, festivals, traveling. I am also a person on Friday evening — after a work week, I love to just sit here and watch a series or a movie with my cats and close the curtains.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you guys have reality TV here?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>I love reality TV. I love “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” “Real Housewives New Jersey.” We now have “Real Housewives of Amsterdam.”</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Really?</p></dd><dt>manon</dt><dd><p>Yeah, it’s amazing. They are crazy.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>These kids were good, well-functioning, nice kids doing their thing.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In 2011, Annelou published the results of her study that had followed Manon and the 69 other adolescents who received puberty blockers using the protocol.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>And they were doing better psychologically.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She found that after an average of two years on the blockers, the psychological well-being of the participants was improved, writing that their, quote, “behavioral and emotional problems and depressive symptoms decreased, while general functioning improved significantly.”</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>But regarding their gender dysphoria, no improvements.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Despite the improvements in general functioning, she found no change in their feelings of gender dysphoria, which she said made sense because the blockers hadn’t actually changed their bodies.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>There was no affirming treatment, really.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But the study had continued to follow the group as they moved on to cross-sex hormones, and, after they were 18, surgery. And Annelou published another paper about how they were doing after these interventions.</p><p>By this point, the group had narrowed to 55 of the original 70. Some patients weren’t included because they didn’t respond to questionnaires. Some weren’t far enough out from their surgery to be included or couldn’t get surgery because of other medical issues. One patient died as a result of surgical complications.</p><p>And in the follow-up paper, Annelou found that the 55 patients she had been following for years, quote, “were generally satisfied with their physical appearance, and none regretted treatment.” She found that their gender dysphoria had resolved.</p><p>She also wrote that their psychological functioning had continued to improve over time, that their rates of clinical problems were now, quote, “indistinguishable” from general population samples.</p><p>But Annelou said that her study had a few limitations.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Because it was, of course, only a small group of adolescents that —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She wrote that her study sample was small and came from one clinic. And she noted that because of the number of participants who had fallen out, between the blockers paper and the follow-up paper, there was the possibility of selection bias. The kids who had remained could possibly have been the ones more likely to improve.</p><p>She wrote that, ideally, there should have been a randomized-controlled trial a study that would have included a group of gender-dysphoric kids who didn’t receive treatment for her to compare her results to. But —</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>It’s scientifically, really, really difficult to think about what sort of control group that would be —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She said to deny treatment to kids who met all the criteria was not a, quote, “neutral option,” that without medical treatment, these kids would further develop characteristics that might bring them more distress, which could fuel depression and suicidality, and that the group who did receive the intervention would be given the, quote, “enormous and lifelong advantage of not being identifiable with their assigned sex at birth.”</p><p>In the conclusion of her second paper in the study, Annelou said that the results signified the first evidence to support this new treatment protocol. She called the findings “promising,” but her final words sound, now, like a bit of a warning. “Clinicians should realize,” she wrote, “that it was not just the early medical intervention that led to the success of this study.”</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>It’s not only the medical approach, but it’s the whole approach. So it’s psychological assessment, but also psychological counseling, if necessary, addressing really psychiatric problems, family difficulties, family challenges.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>It was the approach they took.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>And I like that — how we did that.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But even before Annelou published her results —</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>— both wrote reviews preparing the revision of the standards of care.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— the protocol had been adopted into the industry’s leading guidelines, the WPATH Standards of Care, essentially, the go-to manual for doctors and other providers working in transgender health care.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>And yeah, other clinicians became interested.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And providers from all over the world started visiting the Amsterdam clinic.</p></dd><dl><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>And they sit in with our team meetings.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And to them, they were very interested because there was this new thing to help.</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Yeah. And they thought they could learn from us, how we did that.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And as they brought the care back to their countries, not everyone was following the protocol.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>The sense I got from some people, I think even from talking to you last time we talked, was there is this fear that the Dutch approach has been this rigorous — there’s — a process for evaluation, assessment is central. And the American affirmative approach, and just how it has played out in our fractured health care system has somehow endangered everything, that it broke, maybe, something that you started. You’re nodding.</p></dd><dt>annelou de vries</dt><dd><p>Yeah. I don’t want to pinpoint to colleagues, that they are the source of the things that are the criticism that’s happening now.

How long were you in Amsterdam, and what did you see while you were there?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>I was only there for about a week, so it wasn’t like a tremendous amount of time. But I sat in with Annelou doing several assessments, psychiatric assessments. And I sat in with the team, while they discussed cases, because they would thoroughly discuss every single case before they did anything. And the team was —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Laura Edwards-Leeper first visited the Amsterdam clinic back in 2007, shortly after the Dutch published the first outline of their protocol. And word of this new treatment had started to spread overseas.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>I was just sitting there wide-eyed, like OK, trying to soak it all in as much as I could.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She had just been hired as a part time clinical psychologist for the very first youth gender clinic in the US. And she had been sent there to learn their process.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>The Dutch were very, very strict with who they allowed to start hormones. And so I remember talking to Annelou after some of the assessments that I sat in on and asking, why she wasn’t approving hormones for this kid, where from what I could tell, the mental health issues were really directly tied to the gender dysphoria. And it seemed like that would really help.</p><p>But they were just following a very, very strict protocol. And that’s what helped me figure out what to do back in the US when I came back to Boston.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm. So you were adapting their approach, right? You couldn’t replicate their approach?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Right, yeah, I absolutely could not replicate it because first of all, they had a lot of mental health people and one endocrinologist. It was just very, very heavy mental health component. And I was one person with four hours a week devoted to this. So —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Wow.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>— there was no possible way that I was going to be able to, yeah.</p><p>[LIGHT TONES]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you worry about that first jump from the sort of way the Dutch were doing things to how things kind of evolved here?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Yeah. Yes, I do. And I actually was thinking about this the other day, how they were so generous. They took me under their wing. They taught me the ropes, and then trusted me, trusted me to bring this to our country and try to make it work.</p><p>And there is a part of me that definitely feels like I’ve let them down in some way. It’s weird. I mean, because obviously I know I’m not — I can’t be that responsible. I’m not responsible for all of this going wrong. But I think that they know. I hope that they know how hard I’ve tried to keep things on the right track.</p><p>[LIGHT MUSIC]</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>From “The New York Times,” I’m Austin Mitchell. This is “The Protocol” With Azeen Ghorayshi, Part Three, The American Approach.</p><p>[LIGHT MUSIC]</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>So I got my first job at Boston Children’s Hospital, actually in the Primary Care Center there. And while I was working in primary care, the gender program was getting started. And so I saw an email saying that they needed a very part-time psychologist, and responded immediately.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>When Laura started at the New Gender Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital, known as GEMS, she was excited.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>I’ve been always very interested in gender development. And specifically, I was really interested in adolescent girls and their development.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But she had never really worked with kids who had gender dysphoria before.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Because that was not talked about at that time. That wasn’t an area of focus.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>At this point, there weren’t really any mental health providers in the US who had experience working with these kids the way the Dutch did. The dominant approach was behavioral.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Very old school.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So kids would often end up seeing psychologists who were focused on steering them toward their birth sex.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>If you just need to take away all of the boys’ toys and encourage them to do the girl things, and then they’ll be fine being a girl.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But this new clinic in Boston was going to be different because one of the founders had been following what the Dutch were doing with puberty blockers, and wanted to offer that care in the US, which is why he’d sent Laura to the Netherlands to learn the Dutch process. And when she got back and started to adapt it, there was one change she knew she would have to make right away.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Their assessment process, they did kind of over the course of a year or more, I think.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In the Netherlands, most people lived within driving distance of the clinic and could come for regular visits. But in the US —</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>People were going to be coming from all over the country, so obviously, they weren’t going to be able to meet with me for therapy every week.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— kids would have to travel to Boston from all over the country. So it wasn’t going to be possible to have multiple sessions over the course of a year.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>And so basically, what I created was a structured clinical interview.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So what the Dutch had done across many months, Laura packed into a single session on a single day.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Lots of questions about gender identity development, what’s going on in the family, significant events in the kid’s life. Of course, asking about abuse, and trauma, and all of that kind of stuff was an important piece.</p><p>And then, in addition to the clinical interview, then I’ve used these various psychological measures or questionnaires that ask questions about mental health, as well as gender-related things. And then I would do a feedback session, where I verbally would go over all of the results and information. And so yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Four hours a week just seems impossible to do the job that you were just describing. I mean, how long were the assessments?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Yeah, so I mean, basically, what it ended up looking like was — I think I did one to two assessments a month.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. So there were that few patients that —</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Yeah, yeah. But what occurred to me after one or two of those assessments was that it was just me making the decision, someone who was very new to this field, and only one person, where the Dutch had at least two people weighing in.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And over the course of a year, yeah.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>So I felt very overwhelmed by the responsibility that was on me to be a gatekeeper, because really, I was expected to be a gatekeeper at that point. These days, we never say that. And I don’t really think of it that way. But at the time, I was absolutely expected to be a gatekeeper.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And so you’re stamping yes or no?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Yes, exactly. And so I guess I was nervous about just being responsible for making a decision that would lead to a person, a young person changing their body permanently. I mean, that just seemed like a really huge responsibility.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So almost as soon as she started, Laura decided to make another adjustment to the protocol.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>We were going to require the young person to be in therapy with someone who was going to work with them longer term.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She decided that kids had to see a mental health provider on their own for at least eight months before they could have their appointment with her in Boston.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>We wanted them to be with somebody, like an established relationship with a therapist, long enough that the therapist could weigh in.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Right, and know them well.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>And know them well. And also, so that therapist could stay with them through the course of if they did start hormones, then they would have someone to support them. The problem, though, for the first several years was getting those mental health people to agree to be a part of it because no one knew anything about this work.</p><p>And so I spent time being a cheerleader on the phone with mental health people around the country, and telling them what kinds of things to do to provide support, and how to ask questions, to just engage in therapy with the kid, and basically just to help alleviate the therapist’s the anxiety around being involved.</p><p>I felt like I didn’t know a whole lot, but they knew even less. But it did feel good just to know that there was at least another mental health person who was weighing in. And I felt like I was more closely following the Dutch.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>There’s just so much new here. Really listening to you right now, it seems —</p><p>do you ever look back and think, not did I even know what I was doing, but just that there was no infrastructure for this care in the United States. Were you ever just nervous about doing it at all?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>It’s funny, I was trying to find some of my old notes. And I couldn’t find anything other than my personal journal, where I, unfortunately, did not write a whole lot about what I was doing work-wise. It was more just my life at that time and being over in Europe by myself for a while. But it was reminding me that as I read that, that I had no clue how huge this was going to be, absolutely no clue.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In the first four years at the clinic, Laura saw just 70 or so patients, and passed nearly all of them on for puberty blockers or hormones.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>It was pretty rare that I said no. I mean, at the beginning when the cases were straightforward, just the fact that the young person was surviving in the world as a trans person when everything was going against them, but yet they couldn’t live any other way.</p><p>Their dysphoria was so severe that once we treated them medically, their mental health did improve drastically. And I remember giving talks about how many kids were able to stop taking their psych meds after they started transitioning because it was clearly tied to that. So when I saw how incredibly helpful it was to so many of these kids, it really confirmed for me that it was the right intervention.</p><p>[SOFT DRUM BEATS]</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In 2011, Laura and her family moved to the Pacific Northwest. That same year, Annelou published her landmark puberty blockers paper.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>And then it just kept growing.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Laura was consulting with doctors and hospitals across the country.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>There was just a growing need to train psychologists and other mental health providers on the assessment, especially, but just the therapy, too.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She was also teaching her approach to clinical psychology grad students.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>It felt like I was starting to make a dent in getting my field up to speed.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Youth gender programs were opening at major children’s hospitals in Chicago, Cincinnati, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. And then around 2014, 2015, while Laura was working with a new clinic in Portland, she noticed a lot more kids were showing up for care.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>And it was just filling up like crazy.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>What Laura was seeing wasn’t just happening in Portland. Around the US, and Canada, and across Europe, clinics were reporting a surge in demand. One of the biggest recorded increases was in England, where referrals went from 200 in 2011 to 1,400 in 2015.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>I think in terms of the time frame, people often ask, well, why did the numbers increase at that point? And the most common response you get from a lot of people is, well, it was talked about more, and so the acceptance. And so people felt more comfortable coming out.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Most clinicians agree that part of what was contributing to the increase in demand was growing advocacy and awareness of trans identity. It was Caitlyn Jenner on the cover of “Vanity Fair,” Laverne Cox on “Orange is the New Black.” “Time” magazine called this moment the trans tipping point.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Which I think absolutely explains part of it. But there is no way that explains all of it. Absolutely no way, from my perspective, that explains all of it. I think the internet is a huge piece of it. Because when I started this work, none of these kids were — there was no social media. There was no —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In Laura’s mind, the surge in demand also had to do with the new ways kids were connecting and accessing information online.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>And so I think that’s been a huge thing that has shifted, that has led to an increased number of young people questioning their gender, and sometimes, getting answers much sooner than they would have otherwise.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But it wasn’t just that clinics were seeing a lot more patients, they were also reporting that the kinds of patients coming in were starting to change, too.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>To be more assigned females, which is —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>There were far more kids who were born female. In a lot of clinics, it was twice as many, whereas before, there had been slightly more kids who were born male. There were also more kids identifying as non-binary, so not as trans boys or trans girls, but more fluid, or in between.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>But aside from that, the big things were the later onset of gender dysphoria with no childhood gender confusion.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>There were more kids who had first expressed feelings of gender dysphoria in their teenage years, as opposed to early childhood and —</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Much, much more complex mental health presentations.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— there were kids who had more complicated psychological profiles, with higher rates of conditions like anxiety, depression, ADHD. There were also even more kids with autism compared to years before.</p><p>It was a new group of patients that often didn’t fit the profile of the kids the Dutch studied. They weren’t like FG or Manon. And Laura said, she started to notice that as more and more clinics were opening in the US to meet the demands of this new group of patients —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And so what did you start to see over time as more of these clinics opened up? What was your sense of how they were approaching things?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>It definitely shifted.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— the thinking over how best to treat them was changing, too.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>To follow the kids lead, and to be supportive, and to affirm, and to help get the parents on board.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She was seeing providers moving away from extensive mental health assessments, and toward an approach that put much more emphasis on what the kids said they wanted.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Meaning to just listen to the kid and help explain to the parents what the kid is saying, and then help facilitate the connection with a medical clinic.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But from Laura’s telling, she didn’t fully understand just how much the field was changing until she was invited to speak at a gender conference in 2015.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>This conference, it was an annual conference. And I’d gone there every year I’d been invited.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She was one of four panelists discussing age limits for hormone treatments in front of an audience of other clinicians.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Part of what I was asked to talk about was the assessment process, and what it entailed, and why it was important. And it turned into this very tense conversation about assessment being this hurdle that people were being made to jump through.</p><p>And one of the other panelists just felt very strongly that it was completely unnecessary, and she even said retraumatizing to people to have to tell their story a second time if they’d already told it when they came out to their parents.</p><p>And that alone was shocking that there was this perspective that the mental health role was causing trauma to the patients that we were trying to help. But then I think what was even more shocking was the reaction from the audience, which was a standing ovation for the person who was commenting about assessment so negatively.</p><p>[LIGHT STRUMS]</p><p>People just were suddenly seeming to feel like it needed to be child led entirely, and that there could never be complicating factors that needed to be looked at, that it can never be because someone experienced a traumatic event, or they’re just fed up with what’s expected for them as an assigned female.</p><p>And so they wanted to escape that, that the gender piece was always just, in and of itself, a separate thing that we needed to treat as quickly as possible, whereas that’s never been the way I’ve seen it.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>We spoke with one of the other providers on the panel and the conference organizer. They both said the discussion was tense and that it really became a two-person debate —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Laura talked about a conference in 2015. You were both on a panel.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— between Laura and the doctor who had gone after her approach.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>She also said you got a standing ovation. Does that track with — do you have a similar memory of how this happened, this played out?</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>I remember not the specific event. I’m just thinking about getting a standing ovation, because I don’t remember that at all. But —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>As it turned out, this doctor had also been watching what the Dutch were doing back when word of their protocol was spreading around the world. But she’d thought about it very differently.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>A year-long assessment or six month assessment, I think that we started recognizing, in some cases, that’s doing more harm than good, especially when you’re talking about a puberty timeline.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And it was this way of thinking that was starting to take hold in the US.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>What happens if you require someone to be in therapy for a year, but they have no interest in that? That doesn’t make sense.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So, Dr. Jo Olson-Kennedy, do you pronounce your name Johanna or Jo-anna?</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>Johanna with the H.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Dr. Jo Olson-Kennedy joined the faculty at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles back in 2006, in the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So can you tell me about your own work here? When did you actually start providing this care?</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>So I do not think of myself as a single individual. I want to go back in history and talk about really, this work arising from HIV care. And so we had an HIV youth program before we started doing gender care. And that included a population of older adolescents and young adult trans women, many trans, young women of color.</p><p>And so when these young people were coming in for HIV-related services, either prevention, testing, or treatment, they were beginning to ask, hey, can you do our hormone-related care here? And so it’s not widely publicized, but we began within the division to do that care in the early ‘90s.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So when Jo came in, the clinic was already working with some older trans teens. But then right around the time she started, the Dutch published their outline for using puberty blockers, the same one that inspired GEMS to send Laura to the Netherlands.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>Well, right after it was published, I don’t remember the exact details surrounding that because it’s been a long time. But it made sense. And it was, right off the bat, brilliant. I mean, it made complete sense. We knew that people going through their endogenous puberty left them with changes that they would never be able to walk back, especially considering the population that we’re working with.</p><p>We knew that historically, it’s identifiable trans women of color that are the targets and the victims of violence and sometimes homicide. And so if we could create a situation whereby they were not identifiable, that’s life saving. It was like a piece that clicked into place. And in fact, I remember saying, this is so obvious. It’s kind of astonishing that somebody didn’t talk about this or think of this earlier.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So it sounds like it intuitively made so much sense to you that you didn’t have to wait till 2011 or whenever they published their first batch of data on these kids.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>That’s right. That’s right.</p><p>[LIGHT MUSIC]</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>When you started incorporating puberty blockers into your treatment here in LA, were you following that protocol that they had introduced over there?</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>I think what they did was what they needed to do. Like any area of medicine, when you’re first starting something or introducing a new mechanism for caring for people, you probably err on the conservative side, not knowing what’s going to be on the other end of that.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>While Jo immediately understood the transformational power of this new intervention, she wasn’t as convinced as Laura about the rigorous assessment process the Dutch were doing, in part because when she started prescribing puberty blockers around 2007, the kids who were coming in looking for help weren’t really young kids, like many of the kids the Dutch were seeing. Some had already started their middle puberty or were just about to.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>If you truly want to use puberty blockers to block puberty, you can’t do a year of assessment when they come in right around the time of puberty. You have to do that in concert with that intervention.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The way Jo saw it, these patients were up against a clock. Delaying the treatment, defeated the purpose of the intervention. But she also had some deeper issues with the assessments the Dutch did.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>One of the things that the Dutch repeatedly did was intelligence testing. And so they published —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>IQ tests, yeah.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>Right, and so do we need to do intelligence testing? There was never really a compelling reason to do that, given that they had done this over and over again, and found that the intelligence was the same as the population at large.</p><p>So what other things were they doing around therapy, especially if they were excluding people with mental health issues? So I’m not sure. I don’t know that there’s ever been information published about what were you doing in those therapy sessions, besides honestly making yourself feel comfortable about the gender that the young person is asserting.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Can you talk about that a little more? Is that what you — do you think assessment is sort of — it’s clearly trying to get a sense of greater certainty about how a kid will identify in the future? You’re laughing. So I want to hear what your thoughts are about that.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>I hope that if they figured that out, they would publish that. Because I have never, for any certainty, had or read a publication about, here are the things that tell us if somebody is going to continue to assert this gender over time.</p><p>Who are you assessing now that in 30 years did not assert the same identity? Who is that, and how did your assessment help you with that? I think that’s a really important question.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>To Jo, it was unrealistic to think that mental health providers could somehow predict the outcome for these kids decades down the line. And she said, even trying to predict it was going to affect their relationship with their patients.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>If somebody is in the role of an assessor, and they’re supposed to also be creating a therapeutic alliance with somebody, those things are at odds with each other. And there actually has been —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you think it sets them up as a gatekeeper?</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>Well, I mean, being the person that checks a box that says you can move forward with medical interventions. I think there have been some data. And I don’t know exactly.</p><p>I can’t quote the exact article right now, but that has demonstrated that if people know they’re sitting with someone that’s going to either check off the box or not, if you’re worried that you’re going to disclose something about your life, that then is going to keep you from getting what you deserve and need, you’re unlikely to disclose that information. And that’s a problem. You don’t want that —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And so as Jo began to meet with patients, she said she felt comfortable as a medical doctor doing her own assessing of the care they might need.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>I mean, every patient in medicine gets assessed.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And often, she said, the kid was also talking to a therapist while they were going through this process. But Jo didn’t think it had to be mandatory or for a set period of time.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>There are huge benefits to mental health therapy. But I don’t think you just can say, each person needs exactly this amount of therapy. That’s not how humans are. I think that if there was evidence that demonstrated a year of assessment changed the outcome for young people, then I would have been like, oh, OK, that makes sense. But there really hasn’t been that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>But it was also the only data that we had at that point, right? The Dutch by 2011, that was the only data. That was the only data we had.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>Except that we’d been doing the care since 1991. So yes, there’s published data. But there’s also experience in the field. And experience in the field is what we have when data is being collected. Our experience matters. Experience in health care matters.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The way Jo was thinking about assessment reflected a broader push that was underway against so-called gatekeeping in trans medicine for adults. For years, patients and advocates had been challenging the prominent role of psychotherapy, and were finally getting doctors to ease some of the requirements for treatment, including the need for patients to get a letter of approval from a therapist before starting hormones.</p><p>They argued that these requirements showed an ongoing mistrust of trans people and of patients own understanding of who they were and what they needed. Jo was among a growing group of providers who were making a similar case for kids, that the strict requirements of the Dutch protocol were outdated and perpetuated that mistrust, and that children should be believed when they say what their gender is.</p><p>[UPBEAT MUSIC]</p><p>Not long after she started seeing patients —</p></dd><dt>dr. phil</dt><dd><p>Dr. Jo Olson says children are born this way.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— Jo began to talk publicly about her approach.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>It’s a different process for each child. Young people and their families come in, in very different stages of this process. It’s really important just to support your kid.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>And what does support look like?</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>It’s different for each kid. I mean, there are kids —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And she also began speaking about something else.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>We often will ask parents, would you rather have a dead son than an alive daughter?</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>She started to talk about this care in life or death terms.</p></dd><dt>hoda kotb</dt><dd><p>To me, it seems ridiculous to have a kid at age 12, 13, 14, deciding whether they want to have biological children when they’re 20, 30, or 40.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>Well, they make the decision to kill themselves at 12 and 13. That’s a pretty powerful decision.</p><p>[LIGHT TONES]</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Jo wasn’t alone in this either. As visibility around trans kids was growing in the US, there was also growing awareness that like trans adults, this was a group at much higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than the general population.</p><p>One frequently-cited study from “The Time” found that nearly half of the young trans people surveyed had seriously considered dying by suicide. About a quarter of them said they had actually tried to.</p></dd><dt>johanna olson-kennedy</dt><dd><p>There are high rates of depression, anxiety, suicide attempts.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>So providers like Jo, and parents, and kids who had received the care —</p></dd><dt>parent</dt><dd><p>Would you rather have a happy kid, or would you rather have a dead kid?</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— talked about the urgency of getting kids what they said they needed.</p></dd><dt>barbara walters</dt><dd><p>There are some transgender children that have not been able to be transgender, who even want to die.</p></dd><dt>jazz jennings</dt><dd><p>Yes, and that’s why I’m doing this with you today. I want to help those kids become the person they are. And I want to tell the parents that they should still love them no matter what.</p></dd><dt>parent of jo&#39;s patient</dt><dd><p>Whenever people ask me, how can I just let her do this? I’d rather have a living transgender daughter than a dead son.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In speaking out so publicly about this, Jo became one of the most prominent and influential voices in the field, advocating for what came to be known as the gender-affirming model of care for kids. It didn’t require kids to meet strict criteria for medication.</p><p>It rejected watchful waiting and set periods of time for therapy or assessment. And the ages kids could start medications shifted, too. They no longer had to wait until they turned 12 to start on puberty blockers, or 16 for hormones. It was a model that prioritized treating kids on their own timelines because the stakes were high.</p><p>[LIGHT MUSIC]</p><p>In 2012, as Jo’s profile was rising, and as demand for care was growing around the country, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles officially opened a youth clinic dedicated to Gender Services. And they made Jo the medical director. A few years later, she got a multi-million dollar federal grant to lead the first big study of youth gender medicine in the US. Just a few weeks after that, she appeared at that conference with Laura.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>That was one of the most difficult experiences I’ve ever had in the field.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And Laura realized just how dominant Jo’s approach was becoming, and just how out of favor her approach now was.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>When I started to see the field shift, the nightmare that I had was if things continue to move in this direction that I’m sensing they’re moving, where assessment is no longer going to be really valued, young people are going to move more quickly through this process to medicalization.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>More of them are coming in.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>And more of them are coming in. The cases are more complex. At the same time, the cases are more complex, we’re cutting corners. What’s going to happen? Well, probably, there’s going to be more people who realize it was the wrong decision. And then what’s going to happen? Well, probably, it’s going to result in backlash.</p><p>After all of these years of work that we have tried to move the society forward with accepting trans people, people are going to start to question it, and question, is this even something we should be doing at all, especially with youth?</p><p>And so I started talking about that. And I would tell my students. I probably sounded like a broken record. But I just had this gut feeling that if things did not slow down quickly, we were going to have a nightmare on our hands. It was because of this that I agreed to be interviewed by Jesse for the “Atlantic” piece, because I couldn’t sleep at night. I felt like —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In 2018, “The Atlantic” published what would turn out to be a highly controversial article about youth gender medicine in the US and the debate over how best to approach the care. The writer, Jesse Singal, spoke with several people who did feel they had made the wrong decision, and had either stopped treatment or reversed the medical transition.</p><p>It was one of the first high-profile stories to focus on a group of people who were coming to be known as detransitioners. In some cases, they talked about feeling rushed into a decision they weren’t ready for and getting medical interventions that weren’t right for them.</p><p>Laura was interviewed for the article. And she said, she believed there would only be more of these stories in the coming years because there were so many kids who weren’t getting a comprehensive mental health assessment.</p><p>Jo was also interviewed. And she said that the small number of kids who later regretted their transition shouldn’t influence how care was provided to everyone. She said the approach that tries to prevent regret in advance is a quote, “broken model.”</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Then “The Washington Post” piece was the other huge event, I guess, in terms of me speaking out.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>A few years after “The Atlantic” article, Laura spoke out again, this time more directly, and alongside a high profile co-author, another clinical psychologist named Erica Anderson. She was the head of the American Branch of WPATH, the group that set the standards of care in the field.</p><p>In 2021, they published an essay in the “Washington Post” called “The Mental Health Establishment is Failing Trans Kids.” And in it, they said that providers were increasingly engaging in, quote, “sloppy, dangerous care.” They called out doctors by name, including Jo, who they noted prescribed hormones to children as young as 12.</p><p>They said that in advocating for a model that followed the child’s lead, and that believed if a child said they were trans, they were. Some doctors had, quote, “confessed to ignoring the standards of care.”</p><p>They said, quote, “None of this means that we shouldn’t be listening to the views of gender diverse teens. It only means that we should listen in the fullest and most probing way possible.” And they ended by calling out advocacy organizations and medical providers for what they said was silencing people who expressed regret about transitioning and sabotaging open dialogue in the field.</p><p>In the aftermath of the “Post” essay, the American Branch of WPATH issued a temporary moratorium on its members speaking to the press. And Erica resigned from her position as the head of the group. Laura said she had received emails from many health care providers, privately telling her that they agreed with her.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Just like I told my husband and my friends, this is it. OK, it’s going to be somebody else’s turn to step up to the plate. But it just hasn’t happened.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>But they were afraid to speak publicly about their concerns.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>And I guess my perspective is that if I were a parent going through this, and no one was talking about it, I would be livid. I would be absolutely livid.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you mean that doctors and psychologists are having these conversations behind closed doors where they can’t access them?</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>Right, yeah. If my child was going through this, I mean, and then to find out that the providers were being told not to speak about it also. I mean, I would feel like, what the hell is going on here? That is very suspicious. I would be questioning everything.</p><p>So I just feel like in order to be transparent with the public and with families going through this, we have to be talking about it. And we have to be coming up with a solution to move forward in a better direction. We need to be problem solving.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Laura thinks while some of the reluctance to speak up was because of the pressure from groups like WPATH, she also thinks some of it was self-censorship, because something else was happening around this time.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Your “Washington Post” piece was in November of 2021. I mean, that year was the first year — that was when Arkansas passed their ban, which was the first ban. And then —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>This was when political opposition was intensifying in red states around the country. In the months before Laura published her essay, there was growing momentum for restricting or banning this care for kids. And state lawmakers were citing sloppy care and kids regretting their transitions as part of their justification. So fear was growing in the medical community about the consequences of voicing any questions or concerns.</p></dd><dt>laura edwards-leeper</dt><dd><p>The op-ed that Erica and I wrote, I mean, we spent, I think six months on that. And largely, I would say, because we kind of vacillated back and forth about whether we should do it for that very reason. We were worried that it would be used in ways that we didn’t want it to be used. And we kind of knew it would be to some extent.</p><p>And so we knew that was going to be something we were going to have to deal with. Good will hopefully come out of it. But there could be some bad that comes out of it, too. And it is very unfortunate that it’s been used in ways that we did not want it to be used, to support the bans.</p><p>I’m not in favor of the bans. I really strongly feel like this should be a decision that is made by the family, parents, too, when we’re talking about minors, and the health care providers who are involved. This should not be something that is dictated by the government. That’s crazy.</p><p>[LIGHT MUSIC]</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>In 2022, more bills targeting gender-affirming care for young people were introduced in statehouses across the country.

This is “The Protocol,” with Azeen Ghorayshi.</p><p>Part Four, The Whistleblower.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I want to make sure everything is tied up and rock-solid before we publish.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And so this afternoon, you were on calls all day?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>What were you doing?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So this afternoon, I was checking in with sources.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The hearing in Missouri was scheduled for late August, about six months after Jamie had first gone public with her allegations. And in that time, Azeen had been reporting on the clinic where Jamie worked because while conservative lawmakers had been quick to seize on her allegations and advocates had been quick to dispute them, her claims had never been fully reported out.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— is there any truth to them.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And so Azeen had been talking to patients, parents, former employees, pediatricians, therapists. She reviewed hundreds of pages of internal documents she’d gotten from Jamie, as well as some documents and medical records from parents. And she was getting ready to publish her story.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— to see the light of day. And it’s —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>From her reporting, Azeen had been able to verify many of Jamie’s claims. She confirmed that the clinic was overwhelmed with patients. At one point, they were getting four or five new calls a day, about the same number they got in a month when Jamie first started.</p><p>She also confirmed that many of the kids coming in did have complex psychiatric issues, and that the clinic didn’t always do psychological assessments of patients before providing medical treatment. Instead, they required a letter from an outside therapist.</p><p>Azeen saw a text message from the clinic’s co-director. It was sent shortly after WPATH released an update to its guidelines, co-authored by Laura and Annelou which reasserted the need for kids to have rigorous assessments. The co-director said in his text that he worried the clinic didn’t have the ability to meet those standards.</p><p>In her affidavit, Jamie pointed to many instances where she believed this situation had led to patients being harmed. Azeen was able to confirm several of those instances. She also found other cases independently, like a patient who had gone on to detransition, who said she’d been prescribed testosterone after a single appointment without speaking to a psychologist, even though she’d previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p><p>Azeen sent these findings to Washington University. A spokesperson said they couldn’t comment on individual cases because of patient privacy, but said they had reviewed the allegations and concluded that, quote, “physicians and staff have treated patients according to the existing standards of care.”</p><p>Most of the parents and kids Azeen spoke with said that had been their experience and that Jamie’s account put that all at risk.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I was just talking to parents this weekend who were like, the collateral damage she’s caused by coming out with her allegations just is unimaginable.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Overwhelmingly, the parents who agreed to talk with Azeen, many of them part of a parents’ group associated with the clinic, said the clinic was a godsend, the only place for hundreds of miles where they could get their kids the care they needed. They said that gender care had often resolved mental health issues their kids were dealing with. Some talked about it as life-saving. And they said they felt blindsided and betrayed by what Jamie had done.</p><p>One parent, whose daughter had been cited in the affidavit as an example of harm, showed Azeen her correspondence with the clinic’s doctors. The messages made clear that Jamie had misrepresented some of the details of the story, which made it sound more damning.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I also do wonder if some of the parents are going to be there tomorrow.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And adding to the parents feelings of betrayal was what Jamie was about to do.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>They’re going to feel heartbroken, I know —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>And so while we had come to Missouri to see how this case would play out in a courtroom, we first wanted to go see Jamie on the eve of her testimony to ask her why she was taking this unprecedented step.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And I don’t — I don’t really know how she feels about it. And so, yeah.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>From her reporting, Azeen had been able to verify many of Jamie’s claims. She confirmed that the clinic was overwhelmed with patients.

After Jamie got the youngest kids to bed, we took a seat at the kitchen table.</p></dd><dl><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Are you nervous for tomorrow?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>[SIGHS]: I wasn’t as nervous until I talked to my own attorneys a little bit ago, and he reminded me not to talk to anybody if they’re in the hallway that is like protesters or mean people. And I didn’t even realize that might be a —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I’ve definitely heard from parents, Jamie, who are like —</p><p>feel like their kids are collateral damage in your war path to take down gender affirming care in Missouri and America, frankly.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Those individuals are going to be the people that are going to hold on to this the longest.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>What do you mean?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>The belief that they made the right choice for their kids the longest. They have to. They wrapped their kid into something, and they’re going to be the ones that will never let this go. There will never be a period where they will not personally, probably, hate every single individual who’s publicly stood in opposition to these interventions.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>But also what if their kids are happy and doing well?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Well, those interventions didn’t exist 20 years ago, and their kid could have been happy and doing well if we gave them a different set of care. If their child had these exact same feelings in 1990, their child would not have had access to this. They would have had access to psychotherapy and potentially could have also ended up happy.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I guess, for Austin, who has not met you before, you five years ago, would be shocked, right, to hear what you’re saying now. You clearly thought you were doing the right thing.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yes, but I also thought the right thing was within guidelines and structure. And I thought the right thing was based on really solid, [LAUGHS]: longitudinal studies. I didn’t know then what I know now.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Jamie told us that as she was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what she was seeing at the clinic, she began to do some research online. She learned other people were also questioning the care. Some of them were reevaluating the evidence that had launched this treatment model, the Dutch protocol.</p></dd><dl><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>The Dutch did all of this, basically, for this one tiny cohort. How did that jump from there to here? And how the hell did gems open? How did they bring an experimental procedure from a foreign country into the United States to start in a United States pediatric center, and not have to have clinical research — like, this is like clinical research ethics 101. And on some level, that’s where it all went wrong.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>But Jamie, the clinicians who have been raising alarms about the rising numbers, the lack of assessment, all of that, still believe that there are kids who benefit from these treatments, and they believe that because they’ve seen it with their own eyes. And —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Talking about Laura Edwards Leeper —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Laura Edwards Leeper, for example —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>— and Doctor —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Anderson. Laura Edwards Leeper does not say that she supports bans on gender —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Correct.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— affirming care.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Correct.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And so that’s kind of where you diverge.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Correct.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— and where she — it’s not fair to focus on her. There was that whole letter, all the medical providers in the US who said, we disagree about a lot of things —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yes.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— but —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yes, I know. Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— here’s what we agree on.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Here’s what we agree on. We agree on these bans are bad because it’s legislative interference in medical care. And I just — I’m bringing it up because we’re on the</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>cusp of this legislative thing.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And you’re diving straight into it. I mean, you’re already in it. But this feels different.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>What is the other option? I believe that we have hurt patients. We hurt them. And why would I want to support anything that continues doing that?</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>A lot of people don’t agree, right? And they vehemently disagree. What does it mean, then, to be harmed if you don’t —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>A thing that the parents say a lot is, so where are all the people who are upset? And I just — I do wonder that.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>If we want medicine to be a consumer state and then it all becomes patient satisfaction, right, that’s not what I want medicine to be. Is that really what we want medicine to be? Is it all about — at the end of the day, is it actually just about patient satisfaction? Like —</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Can I just ask, what is the other option, besides satisfaction, that you’re pushing for?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Actual evidence-based care, care that meets a gold standard of what evidence is.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Do you agree with the folks that you’re working with tomorrow on all this stuff? Do you feel like you’re on the same page with the attorney general and his team??</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yeah, I mean, his team is working to uphold a law that I currently support. So yeah, we’re on the same page with that.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Your lawyer has said at a presentation that is on YouTube —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I but —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— that —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>— said stupid shit that —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— that transgender movement poses an existential threat to our culture.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Well, on some level, I mean, there is queer theory that does want there to be the dismantling of the family and society. I mean, there are some theoretical —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>You have an anarchist tattoo on your calf.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yes.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Yes. But you are a person of extremes.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Absolutely, absolutely. I mean —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>I guess, I would just be so curious. I know we’ve talked about all of this a lot, but I would be so curious what Tiger would say about —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I think, on some level, you’re focusing on one trans individual. He’s just —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>No, I’m focusing on one trans individual who you go to sleep next to every night and who is going to take your kids to the bus stop tomorrow morning and who has shaped your —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>And he had the right to make decisions as an adult. Adults get to make choices about their own bodies that are different from children.</p><p>I don’t talk about it much, but it was traumatizing to work in that center.</p><p>I came home from work in tears and could not fall asleep at night because I knew that the next day, we would have a certain patient coming in where the team was in chaos over whether or not they were actually meeting criteria, and knowing that all of my professional assessments are going to be overridden and I would have no ethical say. I am at peace and have so much more calm and sense of self on this side. I feel like a human being again.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Can I actually ask a question before your husband comes home —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Just one thing, that it just struck me when you were speaking about your own experience while you were working at the clinic, and you weren’t feeling like a whole person. And —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— you’re having to push away who you really were. It just seemed like it mirrors a lot of the experience of trans people when they are young and not able to —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Wow.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>— be who they are.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>So sidebar, you might not know this, but I experienced intense gender dysphoria as a child. Some of my first memories were very intense. I was a kid who did not understand why I didn’t have certain body parts. I almost medically transitioned a number of times in my life. I bear physical scars from self-harming, experienced a really difficult adolescence around it also.</p><p>So I am not naive to those feelings. And one of the things that came up in the center often was really wanting those kids to get more therapeutic supports because they were not getting therapy. They were just getting hormones. So I think it comes down to, then —</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>At this point, Jamie grabbed a notebook and pen on the table and started drawing. On one side of a page, she drew a cluster of dots meant to represent a group of kids. On the other side, she drew just one.</p></dd><dl><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>There is an assumption there that medicine today can figure out who that one kid is in all the others. And the problem that I saw working in this center, in this care now, is that not only can people not say how they know for sure that that’s the one kid that would actually long, long, long-term benefit with the least amount of medical harm, they can’t even tell me or be clear about how they can identify this person. And then they also aren’t trying.</p><p>So if you could convince me that these centers in the country actually give a shit about figuring out who this one kid is, and not just medicalizing all of these other kids — because the collateral damage right now is, it’s not this kid. It’s all of them.</p><p>We are transitioning all of — to me, it’s almost a 15-to-1 ratio. We’re transitioning medically all of these kids with the hope that we catch this one. If these centers actually really cared about that one, then they also need to really care about these other 15 because we should not be medicalizing them.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>So you just don’t believe that they will persist in their trans identity into adulthood.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Um —</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Jamie, for the story, I found dozens —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Sure.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>— of parents and kids.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Sure.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>And the kids are in college now and studying psychology and have a girlfriend or a boyfriend or — you know.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>Like, they’re just living their lives. I’m just saying, in terms of, statistically, this diagram that you have drawn with kids that should not have been prescribed hormones and one that should have, it just — I don’t know that you know that that’s the real proportion.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Again, I just — I don’t think that the way to judge the provision of medical care is customer satisfaction. It has to be evidence, longitudinal evidence.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>All right. Well, we should probably give you some space. Just, there are so many people that are going to feel so hurt tomorrow.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Eh. But on the flip side, gender doesn’t have to be that serious, though, either. Their kid is not going to fall apart because they actually experience their natal puberty.</p><p>It really is not — it really is not a crisis tomorrow.</p></dd><dt>azeen ghorayshi</dt><dd><p>But it could be.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I still don’t see that. No, I actually think the best way to help these kids is to less focus on this. We’re telling children, you’re leading. You’re in charge. That does not do well with children’s mental health. And I actually think, as a society as a whole, we need to roll back this whole “let the child lead.”</p><p>Children are — uh-uh, no, no, no. Parents need to step up. And these parents needed to tell their child, even if you cannot have access to this medication at this time, your body is still perfect and whole. We will get you the help that you need. You have support. We are here. You are going to be OK. You can make it through this. Kids need to be taught resilience. And that is not that they require some intervention that demands that their body not go through its natal puberty. They can survive. It is OK.</p><p>[DOG BARKING]</p><p>That dog has probably driven the neigh...

There were people wearing shirts that said “God’s disciple” and “God’s children are not for sale.” One man told us he was there with his church group. Azeen pointed to only a few people she recognized as parents from the clinic, seated in the front row.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p>Over the next two days, we would all sit through hours and hours of testimony. The state called on expert witnesses who questioned the role of medical intervention. One was an American psychiatrist who was involved in the early treatment of trans adults in the ‘70s. And he had worked with the Dutch clinicians, like Peggy Cohen-Kettenis, on the first WPATH guidelines that included recommendations for children and adolescents.</p><p>But in the time since, he’d grown disillusioned with the field and felt that groups like WPATH had become dominated by politics and ideology, rather than by scientific process. He said that he now believed the Dutch study was too weak to support medical transition for kids.</p><p>Another witness was a child and adolescent psychiatrist from Sweden. The country had first begun offering care based on the Dutch protocol, but had recently moved to a more cautious approach, and now recommended puberty blockers and hormones only in exceptional cases. He testified about similar restrictions that had recently been put in place in other Nordic countries.</p><p>Through much of this testimony across these two days, the crowd sat quietly, fidgeting, trying to pay attention. That changed when Jamie Reed was called to the stand. People started leaning forward in their seats and whispering to each other. They seemed to know who she was.</p><p>For over 2 and 1/2 hours, she talked about her experience, walking through many of the claims she made in her affidavit. As the lawyers encouraged her to expand on her account, she said clinicians would pressure parents into treatment by saying things like, would you rather have a dead daughter or a living son? She said she believed the rise in demand was being driven by social contagion, that kids were seeking medical care to transition because of what they were seeing on social media or because their friends were doing it.</p><p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p>At multiple points, people in the audience muttered to themselves and each other about the treatment that was being described. I saw people shaking their heads a lot. At one point, I heard a guy in front of me say, “horseshit.” And at the same time, I saw a parent in the room crying.</p><p>There was one woman in particular who was clearly agitated by Jamie’s testimony. When Jamie was talking about a medication used at the clinic with a risk of liver toxicity, the woman stood up from her seat and left the room. Azeen gave me a look and then followed her out.</p></dd><dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Hello, hello. All right, I’m outside.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>After Jamie’s testimony was over and I got my recording equipment from the car, I spotted Jamie, standing alone just outside the courthouse.</p></dd><dl><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Should I go home?</p><p>outside</p><p>But I know Azeen’s busy. I don’t want to — I don’t want to just skip out on her, but.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Well, would you be willing to talk to me for a second?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>OK.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I can talk to you for a second.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>OK. Well, how are you feeling?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>It was heavy. But it’s over.</p><p>Yeah.</p></dd><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Well, I saw when we were on — or going on a break earlier in the day before you testified, I saw that people were coming up to you. They recognized you.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I think so? Yeah? Yeah. I mean, my face has been out there, so yeah. Is Azeen coming out?</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>As we were talking, we saw Azeen and the woman that she’d followed out of the courtroom heading in our direction.</p></dd><dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Sorry, I’m recording, if that’s all right. Just to let y’all know.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>The woman stopped a few feet away from Jamie.</p></dd><dl><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Collateral damage. Ruined lives because of lies. So, so sad for me? That’s my problem now? That’s my problem?</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>This was the parent whose daughter’s case had been misrepresented in Jamie’s affidavit. It was a case Jamie had pointed to as one of the most egregious examples of harm she had seen at the clinic. She said the teenager had experienced liver damage after being prescribed a drug to block testosterone, and that this parent had then made a kind of threat to the clinic, saying she was not the type to sue, but that, quote, “this could be a huge PR problem for you.”</p><p>In actuality, Azeen had learned, the patient did experience liver damage, but the medical situation had been more complicated than the affidavit had accounted for. And the girl’s mother, this parent, had never threatened the clinic. When Azeen went to Jamie with this, Jamie acknowledged that she’d gotten the information secondhand from the clinic’s nurse, but she said it didn’t change what she thought was the most important part of the story — that the kid had been harmed.</p></dd><dl><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I mean, if I can help in any way or answer any questions, I don’t know —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>I need you to own your truth. OK, so here it is. I want you to tell me the liver toxicity patient — this is a PR nightmare for you, and you’re lucky I’m not the kind of person to sue. Was that said? Do you know if that was really said by a parent?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Um — ooh.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Do you know?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>This is tricky because I don’t —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Yeah. No, do you know?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Um —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Do you know? It’s quoted in your affidavit.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Absolutely.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Yeah, yeah. Do you have proof that a parent said that?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>It was reported to me by the nurse.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Fuck off.</p></dd></dl><dt>[laughs]</dt><dd><p>So why do you say it? Why do you put it in your affidavit as part of your statement? Hi, I’m Jamie Reed. I’m signing this. Own what you wrote.</p></dd><dl><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>And I reported what was reported to me by the clinical nurse.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>So why would it go in an affidavit?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Because to me, I believed it was true because it was reported to me by the nurse.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Boo-hoo, you believed it was true. Was it true?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>The affidavit is —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Was it true?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Babe.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I cannot —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>You have it in quotes, and I didn’t say that in quotes.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Correct.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>You have it in quotes.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Correct. And it was —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Quotes means quote.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>The nurse said that to me as a quote. I quoted the nurse.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>No, you don’t say you quoted the nurse. You say you’re quoting the mom. You say you’re quoting the mom. This material, this text never existed. Never existed.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Unfortunately, I don’t know that it never existed. I still —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>[SCOFFS]:</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>— I still cannot clarify that.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>I can show it to you.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I understand that —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>The last sentence is, to say it out loud, we do not regret any of the treatment.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I understand.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>And they were life-saving for our daughter.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>OK. OK, I — I am totally willing to engage in a dialogue if you find this helpful in any way. If this is just frustrating you, I don’t want to contribute to your continued frustration. So is there anything —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>You ruined —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>OK.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Your affidavit ruined our lives.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I’m very sorry to hear that.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Ruined our lives.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>And it’s a lie.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I don’t —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>It’s based upon information you didn’t have.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I don’t entirely understand how —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Why, I’m going to tell you why it ruined my life. Collateral damage. See, what happened is you put this out, and there’s collateral damage all around. Me. Me! I’m collateral damage —</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>I’m very sorry.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>— to your getting your five minutes of fame.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>This is not about fame. I really, truly believe —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>How many articles — how many interviews have you given?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>To —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>In general, like testifying, YouTube interviews. You know your affidavit has been read, you know?</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>Absolutely. And that was the goal.

That was literally the only one. And there’s text messages —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>So you should have put it in the fucking affidavit.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>You’re absolutely right. It was the last one to go in. And —</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Well, it’s a lie.</p></dd><dt>jamie reed</dt><dd><p>To the best of my knowledge, that information was true.</p></dd><dt>speaker 1</dt><dd><p>Well, look where it’s gotten.

In 2021, Arkansas had become the first state to pass a ban. In 2022, Alabama and Arizona followed. In 2023, Utah, Mississippi, Iowa, Kentucky, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Indiana, South Dakota, North Carolina, Missouri, Texas, Nebraska, Montana, Louisiana, and Idaho, they all passed bans, bringing the total number of states to have passed bans on youth gender medicine to 21.</p><p>Like Missouri, many of those bans were challenged. And as they were making their way through the courts, many of those bills’ sponsors spoke publicly about their belief that letting children medically transition was just wrong. Some called it child abuse. But in making their cases, they leaned on the same argument that Jamie said had convinced her to support these bans — the lack of evidence.</p><p>At the same time, advocates and providers in the US argued just the opposite, that the evidence was strong, saying every major medical group agreed on the necessity of this care. Each side claimed to be acting based on the science and accused the other side of being ideological.</p></dd><dl><dt>julia hartley-brewer</dt><dd><p>No doubt at all what the biggest story in town is today, and it is the Cass Review into trans services.</p></dd><dt>archived recording 9</dt><dd><p>This is the world’s biggest review into this whole issue of trans health care.</p></dd></dl><dt>austin mitchell</dt><dd><p>Then came a highly anticipated report out of the UK that cast both sides as ideological —</p></dd><dl><dt>gbnews</dt><dd><p>Incredibly damning.
