Plans are underway to build nine reception centers along the border — massive tents set up in parking lots, stadiums and warehouses — with mobile kitchens operated by the armed forces.</p><p>Details of the initiative — called “Mexico Embraces You” — were revealed only this week, although Mexican officials said they had been devising it for the past few months, ever since Donald J. Trump pledged to conduct the largest expulsion of undocumented immigrants in U.S. history.</p><p>Nearly every branch of government — 34 federal agencies and 16 state governments — is expected to participate in one way or another: busing people to their hometowns, organizing logistics, providing medical attention, enrolling the recently returned in social welfare programs like pensions and paid apprenticeships, along with handing out cash cards worth about $100 each.</p><p>Officials say they are also negotiating agreements with Mexican companies to link people to jobs.</p><p>“We are ready to receive you on this side of the border,” Mexico’s interior minister, Rosa Icela Rodríguez, said at a news conference this week. “Repatriation is an opportunity to return home and be reunited with family.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has called the expected large-scale deportations a “unilateral move” and has said she does not agree with them. But as the country with the single largest number of unauthorized citizens living in the United States — an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/27/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated four million people</a> as of 2022 — Mexico has found itself obligated to prepare.</p><p>The government’s plan is focused on Mexicans deported from the United States, though the president has indicated the country could temporarily receive foreign deportees, too.</p><p>Mexico is not alone in preparing: Guatemala, its neighbor to the south that also has a large undocumented population in the United States, recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/guatemala-trump-deported.html" title="">rolled out a plan to absorb its own deportees</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A U.S. deportation flight carrying 135 Guatemalans arrived in Guatemala City last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Daniele Volpe for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>While Mexico’s foreign minister spoke by phone to the new U.S. secretary of state, Marco Rubio, this week about immigration and security issues, Mexico and other countries in the region have said that they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/world/americas/trump-deportations-latin-america.html" title="">have not been briefed by the Trump administration</a> on its deportation plans, leaving them to scramble in the absence of any specifics.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“The return of Donald Trump again finds Mexico unprepared to face these scenarios,” said Sergio Luna, who works with the Migrant Defense Organizations’ Monitoring Network, a Mexican coalition of 23 shelters, migrant houses and organizations spread across the country.</p><p>“We can’t keep responding to emergencies with programs that may have the best intentions but fall absolutely short,” Mr. Luna said. “What this shows is that for decades Mexico has benefited from Mexican migrants through remittances, but it has resigned this population to oblivion.”</p><p>Moreover, while the government has a fleet of 100 buses to take deportees back to their home states, many of them had fled those places to escape violence and a lack of opportunities in the first place.</p><p>Other experts wondered if the Mexican government was really prepared to deal with the long-term trauma that deportations and family separations might cause.</p><p>“These people are going to come back and their return is going to have an impact on their mental health,” said Camelia Tigau, a migration researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Even with the new facilities, existing shelters — often small and underfunded — may be hard-pressed to serve large numbers of recently arrived people along with the usual population of migrants from the south hoping to cross the U.S. border, shelter operators said, even though the number of migrants has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/world/americas/migrants-trump-inauguration-border.html" title="">dropped drastically</a> in recent months.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Outside a migrant shelter in Ciudad Juárez last week.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Cesar Rodriguez for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“We can’t prepare because we don’t have financial resources,” said Gabriela Hernández, the director of the Casa Tochán shelter in Mexico City, adding that her team mostly relies on donations from everyday citizens. “So we consider this to be an emergency. It’s like an earthquake.”</p><p>Other shelter operators in Mexico City said they had not been offered extra support from the government.</p><p>Mexico City, the capital, is likely to end up receiving many of the returnees. Studies show that, when deported, people often don’t settle in their hometowns, but <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-66679-7_2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relocate to larger cities</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It is a good thing that the Mexican government is planning for the initial reception,” said Claudia Masferrer, a migration researcher who has studied return dynamics from the United States to Mexico and their implications. Still, she added, “it is important to think about what will happen afterward, in the following months.”</p><p>Temístocles Villanueva, Mexico City’s chief of human mobility, said in an interview that officials planned to create new shelters and nearly triple the capital’s capacity to house migrants and deportees — to more than 3,000 from about 1,300.</p><p>Those who work with migrants and the deported are also concerned that Mexico and other countries in the region could be hobbled in their efforts to receive large numbers of people if the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/marco-rubio-trump-administration.html." title="">halts the disbursement of foreign aid</a>, as Mr. Rubio said on Tuesday that it was starting to do, after an executive order signed on Monday by Mr. Trump.</p><p>“That could translate into a crisis, or at least a temporary weakening of these humanitarian assistance support networks,” said Mr. Luna.</p><p>The United States is <a href="https://www.iom.int/funding-and-donors#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20IOM&#39;s%20funding,from%20voluntary%20contributions%20in%202023." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the largest funder</a> of the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration, or I.O.M., for example, which presently offers many of the services provided to migrants and deportees, starting with the kits of sanitary supplies people receive when they step off deportation flights.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The organization, which is collaborating with Mexico’s government on the “Mexico Embraces You” plan, declined to comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/marco-rubio-trump-administration.html" title="">In a cable sent</a> to State Department employees on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio specifically mentioned migration in connection with foreign aid. In the past, such aid has also gone to programs aimed at alleviating hunger, disease and wartime suffering.</p><p>In his cable, Mr. Rubio said that “mass migration is the most consequential issue of our time” and the department would no longer take actions that would “facilitate or encourage it.”</p><p>Diplomacy, especially in the Western Hemisphere, would “prioritize securing America’s borders,” he added.</p><p>Ms. Sheinbaum has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/migration-mexico-honduras-panama-trump.html" title="">signaled</a> that Mexico could receive deportees other than Mexicans. She said, however, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-mexico-sheinbaum.html" title="">her government planned to “voluntarily” return</a> any non-Mexican nationals — including those waiting for asylum hearings in the United States — to their countries of origin.</p><p>The question of who would pay to return them, she said, was on the list of topics she planned to discuss with U.S. government officials.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emiliano Rodríguez Mega is a reporter and researcher for The Times based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emiliano-rodriguez-mega">More about Emiliano Rodríguez Mega</a></span></p></div><div><div><p>Annie Correal reports from the U.S. and Latin America for The Times.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/annie-correal">More about Annie Correal</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><p>See more on: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/international-organization-for-migration">International Organization for Migration</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/claudia-sheinbaum-en">Claudia Sheinbaum</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a></p></div><div role="toolbar" data-testid="share-tools" aria-label="Social Media Share buttons, Save button, and Comments Panel with current comment count"><div data-testid="share-tools-menu"><ul data-testid="share-tools-list"><li><div></div></li><li><div></div></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">More on the Trump Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Road Map for Retribution:</strong> An executive order titled “Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-executive-order-retribution.html">could be what payback looks like</a> during President Trump’s second administration.</p></li><li><p><strong>How Will DOGE Work?:</strong> With the official establishment of Trump’s effort to slash federal spending — the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/doge-government-efficiency-trump-musk.html">some key information was revealed</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Birthright Citizenship:</strong> Trump’s rhetoric on ending birthright citizenship has focused on undocumented immigrants, but the raft of new orders he signed would also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/birthright-citizenship-visa-holders.html">affect those seeking to enter the U.S. legally</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tariffs:</strong> While much about Trump’s threatened tariffs is still unclear, experts predict they would be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/world/canada/trumps-tariffs-us-canada-mexico.html">bad news for the United States, Canada and Mexico</a>, with few winners.</p></li><li><p><strong>E.V.
