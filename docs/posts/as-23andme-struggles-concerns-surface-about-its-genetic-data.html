Eighty percent of people also agree to have their genetic data used for research on diseases, such as Parkinson’s and lupus, according to 23andMe.</p><p>“People don’t, I think, appreciate how large the genetic information for a person is,” Mark Gerstein, a professor of biomedical informatics at Yale University, said on Saturday.</p><p>“In theory, if there’s a mess-up with your credit card or Social Security number, you get a new one, it can be fixed,” Professor Gerstein said. “But there’s absolutely no way to get a new genome.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>If a threat actor was able to access a genome, which contains DNA information, one of the biggest concerns is that someone’s medical characteristics and potential for health risks, he said, like psychosis or heart disease, could be revealed.</p><p>Though a genome does not change, the technology that is able to analyze it continues to advance and more precisely interpret the material.</p><p>Andy Kill, a company spokesman, on Saturday said the company adheres to the rules regarding the data that it gains.</p><p>“We follow laws that regulate the data we collect and believe strongly that customers should have the choice and ability to decide how their data is used,” he said. “Nothing about that commitment has changed.”</p><p>After 23andMe went public in 2021, its value briefly topped $6 billion, but today its shares are worth less than $1 each. In a <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results?_gl=1*1uwl4dd*_ga*MjA4Mzk5MzExNi4xNzI4MTQwODg2*_ga_G330GF3ZFF*MTcyODE0MDg4NS4xLjEuMTcyODE0MTEwOS4wLjAuMA.." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement released in August</a>, the company said that its revenue for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year totaled $40 million, about 34 percent less than the same period the year before.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Part of the drop in earnings was attributed to fewer test kits being ordered, which comes on the heels of a data breach last year that targeted Jewish and Chinese customers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/23andme-hack-data.html" title="">according to a class-action lawsuit</a>.</p><p>In December 2023, hackers were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/us/23andme-hack-data.html" title="">able to gain access</a> to the personal information of nearly seven million profiles. The company <a href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/addressing-data-security-concerns" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that month that it was taking steps to further protect data.</p><p>“23andMe, in addition to our own strict privacy and security protocols, is subject to state and federal laws that require similar or more protective privacy and security program requirements than HIPAA,” Mr. Kill said, referring to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.</p><p>Although some laws are enforced by individual states, Mr. Kill said that “23andMe took additional steps to apply them to all 23andMe customers globally.”</p><p>Genome structures are complex, and the path to unearthing sensitive information from them is far from simple. But it’s hard to tell what might be accessible to someone with the right tools.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Looking at a genome can reveal a complicated structure, akin to ones and zeros of binary code, Professor Gerstein said. That might make it seem like the information is harder to glean than from a personal tech device.</p><p>“Superficially, there might be a comforting aspect to that, as opposed to if I peek in your email box,” he said. However complex the genome is, though, it can still hold sensitive private data.</p><p>“In the longer term, maybe it actually is more revealing,” he said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-9"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Emmett Lindner writes about breaking and trending news.
