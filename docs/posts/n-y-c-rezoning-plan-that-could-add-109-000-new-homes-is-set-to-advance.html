But the Council must also vote on it later this year, and some members are already resisting major proposed changes for their districts.</p><p>The fate of the plan, known as <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/city-of-yes/city-of-yes-housing-opportunity.page" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">City of Yes for Housing Opportunity</a>, may also be seen as a test of Mr. Adams’s power and political will as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" title="">his administration faces corruption investigations</a>, though the mayor has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p><p>“This City of Yes is so important for the future of the city,” Mr. Adams said on Tuesday at an event in the Bronx. He added: “When you have a house, it’s a luxury to talk about not building more housing. We need to build more housing for New Yorkers.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The plan, if it is not rejected or watered down by opponents emboldened by the upheaval in City Hall, is designed to make it easier to build more and different types of housing through changes to the zoning code. These include:</p><ul><li><p>Lifting restrictions on building apartments above laundromats, shops and other businesses along certain commercial strips.</p></li><li><p>Eliminating costly requirements for new apartment buildings to include parking.</p></li><li><p>Allowing modest apartment buildings to be built near subway, bus and other transit stations in places where they are not allowed today.</p></li><li><p>Making it easier for people who live in one- or two-family homes to build and rent out basement units, garages and backyard cottages.</p></li><li><p>Letting developers build smaller apartments, like those with single-room occupancy, that could be relatively cheap to rent.</p></li></ul><p>All together, the city estimates the plan would allow nearly 109,000 additional homes to be added across New York City over the next 15 years.</p><p>The housing shortage has been decades in the making, as new construction has not keep up with job growth and the strong demand to live in New York City. According to a city survey, the vacancy rate in apartments in 2023 was 1.4 percent — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/nyregion/apartment-vacancy-rate-housing-crisis.html" title="">a 50-year low</a> — and prices for homes remain high because of intense competition.</p><p>Mr. Adams is one of several politicians who increasingly believe that loosening zoning restrictions will jump-start construction, give people more housing options and eventually make things more affordable.</p><p>But that push has also drawn resistance, especially from neighborhoods that are not accustomed to density. Several community boards have opposed the plan, as have both Democratic and Republican politicians.</p><p>State Assemblyman Edward Braunstein, a Democrat representing northeast Queens, held a rally last week to oppose the proposal. He said it “would significantly increase density, straining our infrastructure and exacerbating traffic and parking challenges.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Our Coverage of the Adams Administration</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Adams’s Foreign Ties</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Federal prosecutors investigating Mayor Eric Adams and his 2021 campaign’s ties to Turkey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/fbi-adams-qatar-israel-china-uzbekistan-korea.html">issued subpoenas for records related to five other countries</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federal Investigations Swirl</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The inquiry into the mayor and his campaign is among <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html">several federal corruption investigations</a> that have reached people in Adams’s orbit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stop and Frisk</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>The N.Y.P.D.’s discipline for illegal street detentions is lax at every level — a failure that reaches all the way to the top of the force — according to a review ordered by a federal judge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health Commissioner Resigns</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who led the city out of the pandemic, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/vasan-health-commissioner-resigns.html">the third top Adams administration official to quit in recent weeks</a> amid the investigations of Adams’s inner circle.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Migrant Crisis</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>It’s been a year since Adams made his ominous prediction that the migrant crisis would “destroy New York City.” It didn’t, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/nyregion/mayor-adams-migrant-crisis-ny.html">challenges remain</a>.</p></li></ul></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
