None of Payne’s former bandmates had reacted publicly to his death as of Thursday morning, but some of the biggest stars in pop music posted their memories of him on social media.</p><p>“I’m devastated,” the British singer-songwriter Rita Ora wrote, sharing <a href="https://x.com/RitaOra/status/1846894272345526331" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a black-and-white photo</a> of her working with Payne in which he is resting his head on her shoulder. “He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. I loved working with him so much — he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>She added: “Our song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtT3qs96yb0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">For You</a> takes on a whole new meaning for me now. R.I.P.”</p><p>The pop singer and songwriter Charlie Puth <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/charlieputh/3480405209492927326/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted, “I can not believe he is gone,”</a> adding that Payne was “one of the first major artists I got to work with.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Payne first auditioned on the British talent show “The X Factor” as a solo artist in 2008, and found success with One Direction when he returned to the program in 2010.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Atlantis The Royal</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Outside the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires on Wednesday night, Alejandra Hernández, 21, clutched a bouquet of white flowers as she stood weeping among dozens of fans.</p><p>“I grew up listening to One Direction,” she said, her voice trembling. “It meant so much to me.”</p><p>After Payne’s body was taken away in a fire truck, Mia Elsner, 18, cried inconsolably. “This tears me apart,” she said. “His music was warm and uplifting; he was different from other artists.”</p><p>Elsner said she was trying to avoid social media, where theories about Payne’s death were circulating. “I’m going to skip his songs on my playlists for a while,” she said.</p><p>Camila Martínez, 24, was working in a nearby clothing store when she heard that Payne had died. She quickly asked two friends to join her in mourning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“He was my favorite,” Martínez said. “My heart shattered when the band split. My life was tough, and I’d turn to their music whenever I felt sad.”</p><p>“I’m still waiting to hear this is all a lie,” she added.</p><p>The reaction online was especially strong in Britain, where Payne built his career. Among those expressing condolences on social media were <a href="https://x.com/SPetersAcademy/status/1846844996864868797" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his childhood school</a> and <a href="https://x.com/WBA/status/1846803901418217791" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">West Bromwich Albion</a>, the soccer team Payne supported.</p><p>Payne’s family released a statement on Thursday, asking for privacy. “We are heartbroken,” the family said. “Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul.”</p><p>Payne first auditioned on the British talent show “The X Factor” as a solo artist in 2008 and found success when he returned in 2010. Simon Cowell, the music executive and television personality, brought Payne together with Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson to compete as a group, which eventually became One Direction.</p><p>In 2011, One Direction’s debut single, “What Makes You Beautiful,” hit No. 4 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. The band released five albums and became one of the defining boy bands of the early 2010s. In 2015, One Direction announced that its members were taking a break from performing together, and the group officially split up a year later.</p><p>Hours after Payne’s death, Styles’s mother, Anne Twist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBNIp_1ITDv/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted a picture</a> of a broken heart emoji on Instagram with the caption “Just a boy … ”</p><p>Maya Salam<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="RelatedLinksBlock-7"></div></section><div><div><div><p>Alex Marshall is a Times reporter covering European culture.
