McFadden has been one of the most distinguished in the history of The New York Times, one that has been affixed to hundreds upon hundreds of exactingly reported and artfully composed pieces since Bob joined the newspaper 63 years ago, beginning a Times career remarkable not just for its craftsmanship and productivity but also for its longevity. He retired on Sunday at 87.</p><p>He first achieved distinction as a “rewrite man,” a reporter who would take on some of the biggest breaking-news stories of the day — a jetliner crash, a historic blackout, the destruction of the World Trade Center — without ever leaving his newsroom desk.</p><p>Reporters in the field covering an event would feed him reams of information, and Bob would take it all down, a telephone receiver shouldered against one ear, his fingers flying across the keys of a typewriter and later a computer keyboard. Then he’d funnel the information — it could never be too much — into a sweeping account full of detail, color, voices and drama. His rewrite prowess was recognized with a Pulitzer Prize in 1996.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. McFadden, foreground, worked as a rewrite man at The Times by candlelight during the 1977 New York blackout.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>But he had a second act in store — as an obituary writer. For the last decade or more, Bob chronicled hundreds of consequential lives, some famous and some less so. But even there he was singular, because his mission was not to write about people after they died, the usual sequence, but while those subjects still lived. He wrote their obituaries in advance, each deeply researched, thoroughly reported and fluidly written. Then he’d file them away, sometimes for years, until they were finally needed, when death came knocking.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>These were luminous portraits, always framing people against the broader historical canvas in which they lived, but never losing sight of the often revealing particulars that complete the picture, that render any life as unlike any other.</p><p>We on the Obituaries desk had a name for such an obituary: “a McFadden.”</p><p>And we haven’t seen the last one yet. Mr. McFadden may have left The Times, but his byline has stayed behind. He retired with more than 250 advance obituaries still in the pipeline, each awaiting its day.</p><p>Here is a sampling of the “McFaddens” that have gone to press.</p><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Robert D.

Merrell complained to Dr. Kelsey’s bosses, calling her a petty bureaucrat. She persisted. On it went. But by late 1961, the terrible evidence was pouring in.
