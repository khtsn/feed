General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza had “stained our shared humanity,” undermining the “values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international law, that have been blatantly disregarded in Gaza for the past 14 months,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the main U.N. agency for Palestinians, said in <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/official-statements/what-stake-human-rights-day-not-only-future-unrwa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement about the occasion</a> on Tuesday.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The Israeli military has continued intense airstrikes and operations in northern Gaza while the world’s attention had lately turned to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and, in recent weeks, to Syrian rebel forces’ offensive that led to the fall of the Assad regime on Sunday.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on that strike. It has called on civilians to evacuate much of northern Gaza, but after being repeatedly displaced for more than a year, many have nowhere to go and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-north-evacuations.html" title="">some have stayed put</a>.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/world/middleeast/gaza-hunger-war-israel.html" title="">renewed Israeli offensive in northern Gaza</a> began, the United Nations has repeatedly warned of catastrophic living conditions and the <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/critical-food-aid-lifelines-northern-gaza-severed" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">risk of famine</a> for some 400,000 civilians there. The U.N. and humanitarian groups have said the dearth stems from Israel’s closing aid crossings and <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156946" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blocking the movement of aid on the ground</a> while Israeli authorities have denied limiting aid entry, blaming aid groups for failing to distribute supplies.</p><p>The United States in October issued a warning to Israel to let more aid in or face a possible cutoff in military assistance after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/world/middleeast/us-israel-military-aid-gaza-improvements.html" title="">aid shipments</a> into Gaza in September had reached their lowest level since the early months of the war. There was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-us-israel.html" title="">a subsequent uptick in supplies</a> entering the enclave reported last month, though Israel was still letting significantly less food and supplies into the territory than in the months before the warning, according to its own figures.</p><p>COGAT, the Israeli government agency that coordinates aid entry into Gaza, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza and at the Indonesian Hospital. In its latest <a href="https://x.com/cogatonline/status/1866462605185077404" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update on supplies</a> that had entered Gaza on Monday, COGAT said that more than 200 humanitarian aid trucks had crossed into the enclave.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
