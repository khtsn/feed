</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Both candidates are pouring more money, time and energy into the state than anywhere else, with Ms. Harris, Mr. Trump and their allies set to spend $350 million just on television ads in Pennsylvania — $142 million more than the next closest state and more than Michigan and Wisconsin combined.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Part of Pennsylvania’s pivotal role is its sheer size: The state’s 19 electoral votes are the biggest prize of any battleground. Part of it is polling: The state has been virtually tied for months. And part of it is math: It is daunting for either Mr. Trump or, especially, Ms. Harris to reach the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win without it.</p><p>“If we win Pennsylvania,” Mr. Trump said at a recent rally in the state, “we win the whole thing.”</p><h2 id="link-18d510f3">A ‘microcosm of America’</h2><p>What makes Pennsylvania so compelling — and confounding — for both parties is the state’s unusual mix of demographic and geographic forces.</p><p>It is home to urban centers such as Philadelphia with a large population of Black voters whom Democrats must mobilize. It has fast-growing, highly educated and mostly white suburbs where Republicans have been bleeding support in the Trump years. There are struggling industrial towns where Mr. Trump needs to maximize his vote, and smaller cities booming with Latino immigrants where Ms. Harris aims to make gains. And there is a significant, albeit shrinking, rural population. White voters without college degrees, who make up Mr. Trump’s base, still account for roughly half the vote.</p><p>“This is almost a microcosm of America,” said Austin Davis, Pennsylvania’s Democratic lieutenant governor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>The campaigning in Pennsylvania is fierce and everywhere — the intensity of a mayoral street fight playing out statewide, with consequences for the whole country. Ms. Harris is running online ads targeting voters in heavily Hispanic pockets of eastern Pennsylvania and radio ads featuring Republicans voting for her on 130 rural radio stations. Her team said they knocked on 100,000 doors in the state last Saturday, the first time the campaign had reached that threshold in a day.</p><p>Mr. Trump has dispatched his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, to make more stops in the state than in any other, according to a campaign official, and the state is also where Mr. Trump held his lone town hall with Sean Hannity on Fox News.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Trump is returning for two rallies, in Scranton and Reading, his eighth and ninth in the state just since Ms. Harris entered the race. In Reading, a majority-Hispanic city, Mr. Trump has been offering free haircuts at his offices there on Sundays during Hispanic Heritage Month, according to the campaign.</p><p>And while the former first lady Melania Trump has yet to campaign anywhere, Ms. Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, knocked back a beer while watching a football game recently in a Philadelphia suburb and spoke at a large get-out-the-vote concert last Friday featuring the singer Jason Isbell in Pittsburgh.</p><p>The campaigns are even trying to keep key Pennsylvania activists and officials happy. It was no accident that at both the Republican and Democratic conventions, only delegates from the nominee’s home states had better seats than Pennsylvania’s.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>“It’s the center of the universe,” said Cliff Maloney, who is leading a multimillion-dollar effort called the Pennsylvania Chase to get more Republicans to vote by mail in the state.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-9"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Democratic National Convention in August.

She laughed. But in September, Ms. Harris was in Pennsylvania one out of every three days — a remarkable share for a single battleground.</p><p>Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was not selected as Ms. Harris’s running mate, but he has made numerous appearances for her, including at her rally in Wilkes-Barre, at a bus-tour kickoff in Philadelphia and at another event with the writer Shonda Rhimes in a suburb of Philadelphia.</p><p>Ms. Harris now has more than 400 staff members on payroll in the state spread across 50 offices, according to her campaign. The Trump campaign declined to comment on its Pennsylvania staff but said it had more than two dozen offices in the state.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>On a recent Saturday, Ms. Harris’s Pittsburgh headquarters was abuzz with volunteers grabbing packets of literature to canvass local neighborhoods. One mother and daughter had driven through Hurricane Helene’s remnants from Illinois to volunteer. “I want to put my rubber on the road where it really matters,” Beth Hendrix, 53, said of the decision to trek to Pennsylvania.</p><p>On the wall behind them was a poster of the 65,000-seat Pittsburgh Steelers football stadium. It serves as both a door-knocking goal and a stark reminder that the excruciatingly small difference between winning and losing the state in 2016 was even less than the number of seats in the stadium.</p><p>Only 44,292 votes.</p><h2 id="link-13c59e9c">Bullishness on both sides</h2><p>At times, the national race has looked shockingly local.</p><p>Ms. Harris has picked up spices at Penzeys in Pittsburgh (she purchased a creamy peppercorn dressing base, among other items), stopped by a local bookstore in Johnstown and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1056859569133813&amp;id=100044293396335&amp;set=a.469444884541954" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grabbed Doritos</a> at a Sheetz gas station in Moon Township. Mr. Trump has swung through a Sprankle’s market in Kittanning (he bought popcorn and gave one shopper $100) and stopped for cheesesteaks at Tony and Nick’s in Philadelphia.</p><p>Just how evenly divided is Pennsylvania today? It is currently the only state in the nation where Democrats control one chamber of the State Legislature and Republicans the other. And the margin in the state’s lower chamber is a single seat. The state is also home to one of the nation’s most costly Senate races and two competitive House seats that could tip control of Congress.</p></div></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-13"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Harris in Johnstown, Pa., last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Trump in Kittanning, Pa., last month.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>Democrats are bullish that the party has won key races for governor and the Senate in recent years, including in 2022. But Republicans are optimistic because voter registration has swung sharply toward the G.O.P.</p><p>The day that Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 there were roughly 916,000 more Democrats than Republicans in the state. As of Monday, that figure had dwindled to 325,485.</p><p>Earlier this year, one of the most competitive suburban counties ringing Philadelphia, Bucks County, tipped to the Republican column by voter registration. And in September, Luzerne County, just outside Scranton, became the latest to turn red by registration. Mr. Trump won the county in 2016 by 19 percentage points, only four years after Mr. Obama carried it narrowly.</p><p>One X factor is the regional impact of the assassination attempt on Mr. Trump in Butler County. Some local supporters predicted in interviews that it would inspire the pro-Trump area to turn out in droves. Mr. Trump held a large rally there on Saturday with guests that included the world’s richest man, Elon Musk.</p><p>Abraham Reynolds, a 23-year-old who runs a cleaning business in North East, Pa., was at the Butler rally when Mr. Trump was shot. “That really encouraged me to go out and take action,” said Mr. Reynolds, who became a campaign volunteer and is now a Trump captain.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Abraham Reynolds, 23, was at Mr. Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa., when the former president was shot. “That really encouraged me to go out and take action,” Mr. Reynolds said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Michael Swensen for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><h2 id="link-f28839d">Precision targeting</h2><p>No demographic stone is being left unturned by either side.</p><p>In their debate, Ms. Harris dug deep into the state’s demographic ledger as she laced into Mr. Trump’s desire to walk away from the war in Ukraine. “Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up?” she scolded him.</p><p>Mr. Trump has plotted his own appeals to that population, including a late September trip to attend mass at a Polish Catholic shrine in Bucks County on the same day as the Polish president, Andrzej Duda. The trip had to be scrapped over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/us/politics/trump-travel-events-threats.html" title="">security concerns</a>.</p><p>The two campaigns have also used policy as a wedge.</p><p>Mr. Trump has tried to use Ms. Harris’s opposition to fracking during her 2020 primary run to weaken her support, especially in western Pennsylvania, which is home to some of the world’s largest deposits of underground natural gas. Ms. Harris has since reversed that position.</p><p>Kenneth Broadbent, the business manager of Steamfitters Local 449 in Pittsburgh, said that his union <a href="https://uagetinvolved.org/content/united-association-union-plumbers-and-pipefitters-ua-endorses-vice-president-kamala-harris" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had endorsed</a> Ms. Harris but that his membership remained divided.
