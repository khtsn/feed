(More on that below.) Yet they now face a new dilemma: Should they be transparent with shoppers about why prices are increasing, or — as Amazon learned on Tuesday — risk drawing Trump’s fury?</p><p><strong>A recap:</strong> Trump called Jeff Bezos on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-tariffs-prices.html" title="">to fume over a report by Punchbowl News</a> that the retailing giant had planned to detail how tariffs contribute to price increases. The purported move, which Amazon has denied, would have illustrated the real-world effects of the president’s trade policy, which is already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/trump-tariffs-shein-temu-de-minimis.html" title="">hitting the Chinese e-commerce giants Temu and Shein</a>.</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, delivered an extraordinary rebuke of Amazon during Tuesday’s news briefing, accusing the retailer of being “hostile and political.” Amazon said it had weighed such a move for Amazon Haul, its Temu competitor, but decided not to — and had never considered it for its main site.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p><strong>Still, the conundrum companies face seems clear.</strong> Do they eat tariff-related cost increases and hurt their bottom line, and investors? Do they pass the higher costs onto shoppers, potentially drawing their ire?</p><p>Or do they level with consumers, and dare angering Trump?</p><p><strong>Stifling price transparency could backfire on Trump,</strong> Paul Donovan, the chief economist for UBS Global Wealth Management, told DealBook. Without clear pricing information, Democrats and independents could argue that <em>all</em> price hikes — including non-tariff ones — were Trump’s fault, he said.</p><p>More important economically, levies could also give companies cover to raise prices above and beyond what new duties cost them. “If there is going to be administration hostility to identifying the price impact of trade tariffs,” Donovan added, “then we do run the risk of second-round inflation effects coming through.”</p><p><strong>Ironically, the Trump administration has attacked what it calls price gouging. </strong>The Justice Department is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/business/us-egg-prices-investigation.html" title="">investigating egg producers</a> over rapidly rising prices, which have become a potent political symbol for inflation.<strong> </strong>And last month, Trump invited Kid Rock to the Oval Office as he signed an executive order aimed at protecting “fans from exploitative ticket scalping.” The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-will-end-price-gouging-by-middlemen-in-the-entertainment-industry/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">order calls for</a> price transparency for live events.</p><ul><li><p>In other trade and economy news: Investors are bracing for new inflation data, which is expected to show a <a href="https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/inflation-gdp-economy-pce-data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slowdown in price rises</a>, and G.D.P. data later on Wednesday.

But the media company’s board has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/media/paramount-cbs-60-minutes-trump-lawsuit.html" title="">outlined financial terms</a> for a potential accord with Trump, The Times reports. Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, favors a settlement, but has said she’s recusing herself from board deliberations over such a move.</p><p><strong>The conservative activist Robby Starbuck sues Meta over A.I. answers about him.</strong> Starbuck said that the tech giant’s artificial intelligence software <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/activist-robby-starbuck-sues-meta-over-ai-answers-about-him-9eba5d8a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">falsely asserted</a> that he participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.

Trump administration hard-liners like Peter Navarro, his top trade adviser, have made Vietnam into a punching bag. They have complained about the United States’ <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/vietnam-s-trade-minister-meets-us-trade-chief-amid-tariff-fears?embedded-checkout=true" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$124 billion trade deficit</a> with Vietnam and accused the country of being little more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAfAJtroRRQ&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a waypoint for Chinese-made goods</a> as a way to avoid the steep tariffs.</p><p><strong>American firms aren’t fleeing Vietnam just yet, experts say, given Trump’s whipsawing policies.</strong> Some Vietnamese manufacturers are even <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cut-shifts-or-ramp-up-output-vietnams-exporters-face-dilemma-amid-tariff-chaos-2025-04-17/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ramping up production</a> to take advantage of a short-term arbitrage opportunity. But for the most part, American firms are in wait-and-see mode. “It’s absolutely impossible to make any decisions right now,” John Goyer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview.</p><p><strong>But experts see major shortcomings in the Trump administration’s strategy.</strong> Trump wants to crack down on Vietnam to block shipments from China, as goods are often rerouted through Vietnam to avoid higher tariffs, known as transshipping. Trump sees it as a form of “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114372351596556599" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">non-tariff cheating</a>.”</p><p>If the administration aims to cut Chinese imports, a country-by-country approach is shortsighted, according to Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Cracking down on transshipping, for example, could lead tariff evaders to <a href="https://harris-sliwoski.com/chinalawblog/transshipment-no-magic-remedy-against-tariffs/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">divert goods</a> through countries like Cambodia, Thailand or Indonesia. “It just moves the problem elsewhere,” Manak said. Multilateral negotiations would be more effective in creating rules to curb the practice, she added, “but that’s just not the approach in this administration.”</p><p><strong>China is taking advantage.</strong> President Xi Jinping of China promoted Beijing as a stable trading partner when he met Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam, in Hanoi a few weeks ago. The two sides signed <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-visit-shows-vietnam-balancing-072443111.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">45 deals</a> to deepen economic ties, and Xi pledged to give Vietnam greater access to its market. Xi urged Vietnam to oppose unilateral “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrgk2338dvo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bullying</a>” tactics. Trump responded that To and Xi were out to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/asia/china-trump-tariffs-trade.html" title="">screw</a>” America.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p><strong>But Vietnam is happy to play both sides against one another.</strong> The country’s talks with China won’t stop it from cutting a deal with the U.S. “They’re amongst the most practical and strategic partners I’ve ever met, and they’re used to dealing in a transactional way,” said Daniel Kritenbrink, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam.</p><hr/><h2 id="link-4158fdbd">Mubadala Capital strikes a multibillion-dollar alliance</h2><p>For most of its existence, the alternative asset manager Mubadala Capital has had just one major shareholder: Mubadala Investment Company, a $302 billion Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund.</p><p>That changed in December as Mubadala Capital began to strike deals to bring on external backers. The firm is expected to announce another on Wednesday: a multibillion-dollar partnership with TWG Global, the conglomerate that is affiliated with the investment giant Guggenheim, Michael de la Merced is first to report.</p><p><strong>The news:</strong> Mubadala Capital is arranging a $10 billion investment in TWG Global that includes other investors. That represents about two-thirds of the $15 billion that TWG Global’s leadership, including the billionaires Mark Walter and Thomas Tull, has hoped to raise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>At the same time, TWG Global is committing to put $2.5 billion into Mubadala Capital’s investments. It’s also buying a stake in the asset manager, with an eye to increase that backing to up to $20 billion in Mubadala Capital’s products.</p><p><strong>The backstory:</strong> The two sides had worked together for years. When TWG Global sought to raise $15 billion to fund new initiatives — including buying out some longtime Guggenheim shareholders — it met with a small group of potential investors before deciding to go with Mubadala Capital, Walter told DealBook.</p><p>For Mubadala Capital, committing money to TWG Global opened up a variety of investment opportunities, according to Hani Barhoush, the firm’s C.E.O. TWG Global is affiliated with financial services businesses, including Guggenheim; technology, including an artificial intelligence joint venture with the data consulting giant Palantir; and sports, including the Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers and the English soccer club Chelsea F.C.</p><p>It also gives Mubadala Capital more investment capital to pursue private equity, credit and venture capital opportunities.
