They bring picnic blankets and coolers, sunscreen and speakers, to places where decades ago longshoremen unloaded goods from cargo ships.</p><p>New York has changed since then, and so too have its piers.</p><p>The city was once a major industrial center, producing everything from Pepsi-Cola to World War II munitions. The waterfront brought those goods to the world, and New York’s piers buzzed with the loading and unloading of ships.</p><p>But the decline of manufacturing left the piers derelict and unused, both a symbol and a symptom of the city’s changing fortunes. They were often rife with crime and drug use at a time when both ills brought New York to the edge of ruin.</p><p>That began to change in the 1990s, after a sharp drop in crime, an economic boom and the city’s shift to a knowledge-based economy. New York started to reimagine the waterfront as a common good and many piers have been transformed into well-kept public backyards.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p><h2 id="link-299aed22">Queens: A Gateway to a Booming Borough</h2></p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/00ny-piers-queens-04-ctfw/00ny-piers-queens-04-ctfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/00ny-piers-queens-04-ctfw/00ny-piers-queens-04-ctfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/01/multimedia/00ny-piers-queens-04-ctfw/00ny-piers-queens-04-ctfw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="Justyn Clarke, wearing a blue baseball cap backward, looks into the camera with an intent expression.
