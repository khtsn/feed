He said that Israel remained determined to free the hostages still in Gaza, calling it an “obligation.”</p><p>He told Gazans that whoever “sets aside their weapons and returns our hostages — we will allow them to leave and live.” But he warned that anyone who harmed Israeli hostages would pay with their lives.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Israeli leaders have long said they would not stop their offensive in Gaza until they had crushed Hamas as a military and political force and had freed the hostages seized on Oct. 7.

After the firefight killed Mr. Sinwar and two other fighters, the Israelis found the area littered with explosives and approached the bodies cautiously. They found money and weapons, according to one Israeli official.</p><p>Photographs obtained by The New York Times, some of which later circulated online, show the body of a man with facial features strongly resembling Mr. Sinwar’s. The body had severe wounds, including to the head and leg.</p><p>Mr. Sinwar died after Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents had spent months trying to locate him, finding clues but never managing to trap him, an Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told reporters. Mr. Sinwar’s DNA had been found at one point in a tunnel a few hundred meters from where the bodies of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/world/middleeast/idf-hostages-hamas-tunnel.html" title="">six Israeli hostages</a> were found six weeks ago, Admiral Hagari said. Israel collected DNA information from Mr. Sinwar during his decades-long incarceration inside Israeli jails.</p><p>The news that Mr. Sinwar had been killed led to celebrations in Israel, as people gathered on rooftops and streets to cheer and wave Israeli flags, and drivers honked their horns.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>For some of the hostages’ families, it was a moment of both satisfaction and trepidation. Many worried that their relatives might now be in greater danger.</p><p>Einav Zangauker, whose son, Matan Zangauker, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, made a direct plea to Mr. Netanyahu in <a href="https://x.com/kann_news/status/1846923444073419098" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video</a> on social media: “Don’t bury the hostages.”</p><p>“You have your victory image,” she said. “Now bring a deal.”</p><p>Orna and Ronen Neutra, the parents of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/us/israel-americans-missing-killed-hostage.html?rsrc=deeplink&amp;ogrp=dpl#link-db3a646" title="">Omer Neutra</a>, a hostage who grew up on Long Island, in New York, and later joined the Israeli military, urged that “all attention” should turn to securing the release of the captives.</p><p>As word of Mr. Sinwar’s death traveled through Gaza, many were stunned. At a makeshift cafe on the side of a road in Khan Younis, where Mr. Sinwar was born in 1962, people stopped to watch the news on television.</p><p>Another resident of the southern city, Rayan Raef Hamdan, 20, said she would wait until Hamas confirmed the news and was hoping it was false, like previous reports of his demise.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><p>“Since the beginning of the war, we have heard many of these rumors,” she said, adding: “We hope that God will prolong his life and save him from death.”</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-17"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Destroyed buildings in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip on Thursday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Other Gazans welcomed Mr. Sinwar’s death, blaming him for the hunger, unemployment and homelessness the conflict had caused.</p><p>“He humiliated us, started the war, scattered us and made us displaced, without water, food or money,” said a 22-year-old named Mohammed, who has been repeatedly displaced and asked that his last name not be used for fear of reprisals from Hamas.</p><p>“He is the one who made Israel do this,” Mohammed said, calling Mr. Sinwar’s death “the best day of my life.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Rezeq el-Sabti, a 44-year-old father who was sheltering with his family in a tent in central Gaza, said he hoped that Mr. Netanyahu would now declare victory.</p><p>“Netanyahu will say to his people that ‘We killed Sinwar, who waged war on us,’” Mr. el-Sabti said, “and this gives us hope that the war will end.”</p><p>Still others said little would change with Mr. Sinwar’s death. “Many preceded him,” said Rehab Ibrahim Odeh, 64. “And he is no better than those who have passed away before.”</p><p>Iranian state news media portrayed Mr. Sinwar’s death as “martyrdom” and praised him for dying while fighting Israel on the battlefield in Gaza.</p><p>American officials immediately seized on Mr. Sinwar’s death to try to renew stalled negotiations aimed at achieving a truce in Gaza that would free the hostages there and allow more aid into the enclave.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>President Biden told reporters in Berlin that he had congratulated Mr. Netanyahu and would send the secretary of state, Antony J.
