Now, with Kamala Harris atop the ticket, the vice president and her allies are trying something new: They are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/harris-attack-lines-trump.html" title="">looking to deflate him</a>.</p><p>During this week’s Democratic convention in Chicago, party leaders have sought to paint Trump as a meanspirited fraud who cares only about himself and his billionaire friends. They have depicted him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/trump-democrats-mockery.html" title="">as an anti-union “scab” and a fake working man’s populist</a>. The strategy is designed to erode Trump’s support among mostly white middle-class voters in states, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, that could decide the election.</p><p>Tonight, Tim Walz will formally accept the nomination for vice president. Harris chose him as her running mate after his attempts to deflate Trump and other Republicans — by calling them “weird” — struck a cord with Democrats.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Here’s what else to know:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Trump traveled to North Carolina for his first outdoor rally since his assassination attempt. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/21/us/harriz-walz-dnc-trump" title="">He was shielded by bulletproof glass</a>.</p></li><li><p>Harris has gone light on climate policy. Climate leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/climate/climate-policy-harris.html" title="">say they are fine with that</a>.</p></li><li><p>We examined claims about Walz’s military service. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/us/politics/tim-walz-military-service.html" title="">Here’s what’s true</a>.</p></li></ul><hr/><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="link-4b3cff21">The U.S. added far fewer jobs than previously reported</h2><p>The Labor Department announced today that monthly payroll figures had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/us-jobs-economy.html" title="">overstated U.S. job growth by roughly 818,000</a> in the 12 months that ended in March, an unusually large revision. The downward revision, of about 28 percent, was a sign that cracks in the labor market — which until recently appeared rock solid — are more severe than initially believed.</p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A destroyed home in Katzrin, in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Ariel Schalit/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div><h2 id="link-417daf5d">Israel and Hezbollah exchanged strikes</h2><p>The Israeli military today launched airstrikes in Lebanon that it said had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/21/world/israel-iran-hamas-gaza-war/the-israeli-military-said-it-had-hit-weapons-facilities-prompting-hezbollah-to-target-an-israeli-base?smid=url-share" title="">struck weapon-storage facilities used by Hezbollah</a>, the Iranian-backed militia.

Margaret considers the show to be among the greatest in television history, and many others share her lofty praise.</p><p>Based on a book by David Simon, the creator of “The Wire,” “Homicide” blends gallows humor and cynicism with operatic emotion and soaring monologues. It feels just as fresh, jarring and original now as it did 30 years ago.</p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Patrick T.

Savers can stock up on discounted groceries in bulk, while big spenders can take home 98-inch flat screens.</p><p>Few companies have greater influence over what we eat (or wear, or fuel our cars with or use for personal hygiene). Ostensibly, Costco is a discount store, but it is also an aspirational shopping experience, feeding that most American of appetites: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/dining/costco.html" title="">conspicuous consumption</a>.</p><hr/></div></div><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mamie Kirkland in 2015.

Their 12-minute performances are beautiful arrangements of trumpets, flags, dancers and, of course, drums.</p><p>But the activity is not for the faint of heart. The rehearsals are grueling, and can last up to 12 hours a day. The performers pay thousands of dollars to compete. And once they turn 22, musicians are no longer eligible to compete. But for many participants, there’s something special about dedicating their life to creating perfection — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/style/bluecoat-drum-corps-championship.html" title="">and then leaving it all behind</a>.</p><p>Have a momentous evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
