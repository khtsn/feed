So, don’t make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.”</p><p>Canada was not on Ms. Swift’s list of concert destinations last summer when she announced a batch of new shows for her tour. Or maybe she was just saving the best news — at least for Canadian fans — for last. </p><p>Now, Ms. Swift is wrapping up her blockbuster Eras Tour in Canada, sending Toronto into a glittery frenzy. Her shows have become cultural events in every city she plays, jolting local economies, uniting legions of fans and mobilizing cities around her star power.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-1"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Swift is scheduled to perform six shows at the Rogers Center in Toronto, drawing 240,000 concertgoers.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“The Eras Tour is kind of the Woodstock of our generation,” said Jasmeet Sidhu, a Canadian photographer and director who was showcasing her images of Ms. Swift’s past performances.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Ms. Swift’s version of Woodstock, while more commercial than activist, has certainly delivered on unity: Witness the multicolored friendship bracelets that her fans — who call themselves Swifties — have taken to making, wearing and trading.</p><p>Ms. Swift is scheduled to perform six shows in Toronto, which are expected to draw 240,000 concertgoers, before heading to Vancouver for three shows, ending the tour on Dec. 8.</p><p>Many people are desperate to catch a final glimpse.</p><p>They include Stephanie Jenkins of Charlotte, N.C., and her 12-year-old daughter, Ellen, who had been en route to Vienna when news broke that Ms. Swift’s show there had been canceled following <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/cia-isis-warning-taylor-swift-concert.html" title="">a foiled terrorism attack</a>. </p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ellen Jenkins and her mother Stephanie sit outside the Rogers Center in hopes of acquiring tickets to Ms. Swift’s concert.

He had flown in with his wife and daughter, spending about 3,500 in Canadian dollars (roughly $2,500) on flights and tickets alone. </p><p>Silver lining: They were saving money on high hotel prices by staying with family, and it was a worthy Christmas gift for his daughter, Maddyn, 12, who would be attending her first concert.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans of Ms. Swift braved the rain outside the concert venue.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>People of all ages were in the audience, but for the generation of women around Ms. Swift’s age, 34, her music heralded them into womanhood. </p><p>For Stacy Wetmore, 31, Ms. Swift’s earlier hits, like “Teardrops On My Guitar,” would be on repeat in the mornings when she got ready for school. She and her friends Kyra Clark and Taylor Fischer had traveled from Columbia, Md., with tickets for Saturday’s show.<span>  </span></p><p>“Listening to these songs, you’re like, wow, I’ve been through something like that,” Ms. Fischer said. “It feels good to be seen.”</p><p>As Jenny Palmiotto and her daughter, Grace, prepared to enter the stadium on Thursday, they reflected on how the tour had prompted them to visit new places to see her perform, far from their home in San Diego.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>“We’ve never been to Poland or Sweden, and now, Canada,” said Ms. Palmiotto.
