So, don’t make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.”</p><p>Canada was not on Ms. Swift’s list of concert destinations last summer when she announced a batch of new shows for her tour. Or maybe she was just saving the best news — at least for Canadian fans — for last. </p><p>Now, Ms. Swift is wrapping up her blockbuster Eras Tour in Canada, sending Toronto into a glittery frenzy.

He had flown in with his wife and daughter, spending about 3,500 in Canadian dollars (roughly $2,500) on flights and tickets alone. </p><p>Silver lining: They were saving money on high hotel prices by staying with family, and it was a worthy Christmas gift for his daughter, Maddyn, 12, who would be attending her first concert.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Fans of Ms. Swift braved the rain outside the concert venue.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>People of all ages were in the audience, but for the generation of women around Ms. Swift’s age, 34, her music heralded them into womanhood. </p><p>For Stacy Wetmore, 31, Ms. Swift’s earlier hits, like “Teardrops On My Guitar,” would be on repeat in the mornings when she got ready for school.
