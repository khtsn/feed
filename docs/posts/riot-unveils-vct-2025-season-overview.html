			<p>Only nice cities for the Majors. :)</p>
<p>I guess by what we know for the upcoming rosters the main favourites will be Heretics, EDG, NRG, Sentinels, Vitality, Gen.G and I&#39;d say T1 and Paper Rex as the &#34;secret weapons&#34; because they looked so strong recently... and I think MIBR, Cloud9, RRQ, NAVI and FUT could become very, very annoying to the main favourites.</p>		</div>

		<p>Hmm... yeah. They looked a bit mezzo mezzo, but in the end it&#39;s still a strong roster and when we talk about majors there is still a lot of prep time. I will never underestimate Koreans in e-sports. DRX is also like a full super-talent team comparable to Heretics but only Koreans now. Sin Prisa (better said their new org) could also surprise many people.</p>
