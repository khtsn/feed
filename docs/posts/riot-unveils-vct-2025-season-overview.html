			<p>Only nice cities for the Majors. :)</p>
<p>I guess by what we know for the upcoming rosters the main favourites will be Heretics, EDG, NRG, Sentinels, Vitality, Gen.G and I&#39;d say T1 and Paper Rex as the &#34;secret weapons&#34; because they looked so strong recently... and I think MIBR, Cloud9, RRQ, NAVI and FUT could become very, very annoying to the main favourites.</p>		</div></div>
