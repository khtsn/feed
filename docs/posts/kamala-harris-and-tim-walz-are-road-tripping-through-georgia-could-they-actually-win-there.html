So hot. So sticky. But this week strikes me as the perfect moment for the Democratic presidential ticket to take a quick bus tour around southern Georgia.</p><p>Hot off their multiday love fest in Chicago, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are making clear they intend to play hard for Georgia, a battleground state, and not just in the politically blue, population-rich metro area of Atlanta. With the presidential race promising to be tight and ugly, they are wisely venturing outside the party’s usual comfort zones and are sending a message similar to the one from their preconvention road trip around Pennsylvania: We will show up in every part of the state and fight for every vote.</p><p>It seems worth noting that southern Georgia has an abundance of Black voters, a demographic the Democratic Party was feeling very shaky about when President Biden was looking like the nominee — and is hoping to re-energize now that Harris is at the top of the ticket. But even before Biden stepped aside, the party was investing in the area. “The South Georgia region is a priority for the campaign,” a representative for the Harris team <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-tim-walz-georgia-convention-momentum-rcna168039" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NBC</a>. “We have nearly 50 full-time staff across seven offices in the area, including Valdosta. We have hosted more than 500 events in the region since May 31.”</p><p>Team Trump is not conceding any ground. Last week Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, headlined an event in Valdosta, a majority-Black city not too far from the Florida state line. (Although it was Vance’s cringey <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/23/jd-vance-georgia-donut-shop/74922663007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stop</a> at an <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/jd-vances-very-awkward-stop-at-georgia-donut-shop-goes-viral/ar-AA1pgyNu?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">area doughnut shop</a> that wound up being widely shared on social media.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>So far, Trump has a polling edge in the state. But his troubled history with Georgia, where he is widely believed to have cost Republicans a Senate seat or two in recent years, makes it tricky terrain. Also, he has struggled to let go of his feud with the state’s popular governor, Brian Kemp. Just a few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/trump-rekindles-feud-kemp-atlanta-rally/85-69e2ac28-cf9c-4ba7-a434-32420d7f137f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump trashed Kemp</a> at a rally in Atlanta. This freaked out more than a few Republicans, and some kind of truce was brokered.
