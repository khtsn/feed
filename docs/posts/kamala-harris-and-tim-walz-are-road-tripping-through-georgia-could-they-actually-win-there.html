    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I can see why many people might not consider late August the best time to head to the Deep South. So hot. So sticky. But this week strikes me as the perfect moment for the Democratic presidential ticket to take a quick bus tour around southern Georgia.</p><p>Hot off their multiday love fest in Chicago, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are making clear they intend to play hard for Georgia, a battleground state, and not just in the politically blue, population-rich metro area of Atlanta.

(Although it was Vance’s cringey <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/23/jd-vance-georgia-donut-shop/74922663007/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stop</a> at an <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/jd-vances-very-awkward-stop-at-georgia-donut-shop-goes-viral/ar-AA1pgyNu?ocid=BingNewsSerp" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">area doughnut shop</a> that wound up being widely shared on social media.)</p></div></div>
