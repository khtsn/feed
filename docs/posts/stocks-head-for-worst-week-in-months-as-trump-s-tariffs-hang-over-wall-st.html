Surveys have also showed mounting concern among consumers.</p><p>On Friday, a fresh report on the labor market offered some relief but not enough to withstand the selling pressure taking hold of the market. The data showed a pace of hiring moderate enough to temper fears about resurgent inflation, yet robust enough to avoid worries about a slowing economy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Lara Castleton, U.S. head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, said the data would probably ease “overly sour expectations” about the economy.</p><p>“After confidence on the economy has taken a turn,” she said, “market participants were looking to either confirm or reverse that sentiment.”</p><p>Investors who had hoped that President Trump’s tariff threats were just a negotiating tactic were disappointed on Tuesday when 25 percent tariffs came into force on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10 percent tariffs on China. Concessions were made on Thursday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs-suspended.html" title="">suspending the tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico</a>, but it failed to stoke a rally.</p><p>“I think the markets are essentially taking President Trump a bit more seriously on tariffs,” said Jim Caron, chief investment officer of the portfolio solutions group at the Morgan Stanley Investment Institute. He said that despite the recent sell-off, major stock indexes remained close to record highs and the economy remained in good shape.</p><p>Much of the sell-off has been driven by big technology companies, which, because of their size, have a big effect on broad indexes. Since the S&amp;P 500 peaked on Feb. 19, the index has fallen more than 7 percent. A separate measure that gives all of the stocks an equal weight in the index had fallen 4.6 percent over the same period.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>What isn’t clear is whether investors are selling because they see the tide turning for tech companies or because of broader concerns.</p><p>“In the last couple of weeks, and maybe for the next couple of weeks, we have gone through a very challenging news cycle,” Mr. Caron said. “We need to get through that and assess how much damage there is to markets.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Joe Rennison writes about financial markets, a beat that ranges from chronicling the vagaries of the stock market to explaining the often-inscrutable trading decisions of Wall Street insiders.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-rennison">More about Joe Rennison</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Explore Our Business and Tech Coverage</h2><h3>Dive deeper into the people, issues and trends shaping the worlds of business and technology.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>How Altman Won Over Trump: </strong>After helping President Trump get elected, Elon Musk was poised to dominate America’s A.I. policies.
