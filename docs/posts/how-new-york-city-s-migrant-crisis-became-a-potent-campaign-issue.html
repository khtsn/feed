And on Long Island, a Democratic hopeful struck a similar note, vowing to secure the southern border because the spillover from New York City had the suburbs “feeling the migrant crisis almost every day.”</p><p>Few cities have borne the burden of the migrant crisis like New York, which has received more than 210,000 asylum seekers over the past two years. But the political fallout of the crisis has spilled into competitive House races across the state. Republicans have used New York City to illustrate the disorder that they say has been wrought by Democratic immigration policies, with Democrats responding by adopting a tougher approach to border security.</p><p>The city’s migrant crisis has also come up in the presidential race. Former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1848450732200005681" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed at a rally</a> this month that migrant criminals had “taken over Times Square,” exaggerating <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/young-and-vicious-tren-de-aragua-youth-crew-at-nyc-migrant-shelter-targets-times-square/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent reporting by The New York Post</a> about migrant gang activity in Manhattan.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>In doing so, Mr. Trump typified his party’s strategy of intertwining the migrant influx with two other pressing issues for voters: crime and high living costs.</p><p>That tactic has been frequently deployed by Republicans in contested House races in New York that could help decide control of Congress, with New York City a frequent target in debates, stump speeches and attack ads.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Representative Mike Lawler said that the arrival of migrants was costing taxpayers billions of dollars, and that it could be felt in his Hudson Valley district.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Jon Cherry for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican locked in a tight race for re-election, said that the arrival of migrants had placed a noticeable strain on his Hudson Valley district, just north of the city, including on schools, food pantries and the housing market.</p><p>“It’s a major issue and people recognize it,” Mr. Lawler said in an interview. “Even if the number has come down, both in terms of crossings and in terms of those being housed in a shelter in New York City, the fact still remains that it is costing taxpayers billions of dollars.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Even a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/nyregion/the-fight-over-proposition-1-in-new-york.html" title="">statewide ballot question</a> meant to codify the right to an abortion in the State Constitution <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/us-news/tv-ad-claims-nys-prop-1-ballot-measure-will-aid-illegal-immigration-non-citizen-voting/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been seen</a> through the lens of the migrant crisis, with <a href="https://x.com/anthonydespo/status/1831771997170495737?s=61" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republican opponents arguing</a> that it would open the door for special rights and services for undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Fears among New York Democrats that the migrant crisis could hurt them in November <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/nyregion/hochul-migrant-crisis.html" title="">date to last year</a>, when <a href="https://static.politico.com/ab/4c/2e23de284e05aa668a40396aa6c3/sny0823-crosstabs.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public polling</a> at the height of the influx showed that voters disapproved of how President Biden, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mr. Adams — all Democrats — were handling the crisis.</p><p>Democrats managed to contain some of the fallout. Mr. Adams largely abandoned plans to bus migrants to upstate communities after a fierce backlash, but New Yorkers still remain apprehensive about the influx, even as doom-and-gloom headlines have diminished.</p><p>Republicans frequently cite the taxpayer-funded services that migrants have received in New York City — including free shelter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/nyregion/hotels-prices-migrants-nyc.html" title="">at hotels</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/nyregion/migrant-debit-cards.html" title="">debit cards for a group of migrant families</a> to pay for food — as examples of what they say is wasteful spending at the expense of Americans.</p><p>Republicans, who have long leaned on a perception of chaos in New York City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/republican-election-results-new-york.html" title="">as a tool to mobilize suburban and upstate voters</a>, are bullish that the migrant crisis still resonates, even as the number of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/us/border-immigration-current-situation.html" title="">crossing the southern border has fallen</a> and the situation in the city has shown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/randalls-island-nyc-migrant-shelter-closing.html" title="">signs of stabilizing</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Indeed, a Siena College poll from July found that 83 percent of voters statewide, including a high share of Democrats, believed that the migrant influx was “very serious” or “somewhat serious.” In August, 64 percent of New Yorkers said they believed the influx <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SNY0724-Crosstabs.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had gotten worse over the last year</a>, with a higher share of suburban voters seeing the situation as more dire. </p><p>Democrats in contested House races have taken notice. Deviating sharply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/briefing/immigration-policy-democrats.html" title="">from how the party once spoke</a> about immigration policy, they now urgently and proactively cast themselves as intent on securing the border.
