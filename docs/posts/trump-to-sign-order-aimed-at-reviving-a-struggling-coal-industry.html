The administration also plans to designate coal a critical mineral, which could speed up federal approval of new mines. And it intends to open more federal land to mining.</p><p>In the past several months, Mr. Trump, Chris Wright, the energy secretary, and Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, have all spoken about the importance of coal. “We have clean, beautiful coal, more than anybody else,” Mr. Trump said Monday during an appearance in the Oval Office with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>Coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels when burned, and accounts for <a href="https://globalcarbonbudget.org/fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-increase-again-in-2024/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roughly 40 percent of the world’s industrial carbon dioxide emissions</a>, the main driver of global warming.

</div></section></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>It is unclear how much Mr. Trump could reverse that decline. In 2011, the nation generated nearly half of its electricity from coal; last year, that fell to just 15 percent. Utilities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/06/climate/coal-plants-retirement.html" title="">have already closed</a> hundreds of aging coal-burning units and have announced closing dates for roughly half of the remaining plants.</p><p>Over the past year, growing interest in artificial intelligence and data centers has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html" title="">fueled a surge in electricity demand</a>, and some utilities have decided to keep at least some coal plants open past their scheduled closure dates. And as the Trump administration moves to loosen pollution limits on coal power — including regulations applied to carbon-dioxide and mercury — more plants could stay open longer, or run more frequently.</p><p>In discussing coal plants last month, Mr. Burgum said: “These are clean coal plants, they’ve been the most regulated segment of our energy industry. I applaud them if they’re still open and we need them to stay open.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A major coal revival seems unlikely, some analysts said.</p><p>“The main issue is that most of our coal plants are older and getting more expensive to run, and no one’s thinking about building new plants,” said Seth Feaster, a data analyst who focuses on coal at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research firm. “It’s very hard to change that trajectory.”</p><p>During his first term, Mr. Trump suggested that he would use emergency authority to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/climate/trump-coal-nuclear-power.html" title="">force uneconomical coal plants</a> to stay open rather than retire. But that idea triggered a fierce blowback from oil and gas companies, electrical grid operators and consumer groups, and the administration abandoned the idea.</p><p>Ultimately, Mr. Trump struggled to fulfill his first-term pledge of rescuing the coal industry. Despite the fact that his administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html" title="">repealed numerous climate regulations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/climate/andrew-wheeler-epa-confirmation.html" title="">appointed a coal lobbyist</a> to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, 75 coal-fired power plants closed, and the industry shed about 13,000 jobs during his presidency.</p><p>Coal’s decline continued under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who sought to move the country away from the fossil fuel altogether in an effort to fight climate change. Last year, his administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/climate/biden-power-plants-pollution.html" title="">issued a sweeping E.P.A. rule</a> that would have forced all of the nation’s coal plant to either capture and bury their carbon dioxide emissions or shut down by 2039.</p><p>This year, upon returning to office, Mr. Trump ordered the E.P.A. to repeal that rule. And Trump administration officials have repeatedly warned that shutting down coal plants will make the nation’s grid less reliable. Unlike wind and solar power, coal plants can run at all hours, making them useful when electricity demand spikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“We are on a path to continually shrink the electricity we generate from coal,” Mr. Wright <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/us-should-stop-closure-of-coal-fired-power-plants-wright-says" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Bloomberg Television</a> in February. “That has made electricity more expensive and our grid less stable.”</p><p>Some industry executives who run the nation’s electric grids <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/03/26/grid-managers-promote-fossil-fuels-during-reliability-hearing-00247974" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have also warned</a> that the country could face a greater risk of blackouts if too many coal plants retire too quickly, especially since power companies have faced delays in bringing new gas, wind and solar plants online, as well as in adding battery storage and transmission lines.</p><p>Yet coal opponents say that keeping aging plants online can bring with it steep costs. Earlier this year, PJM Interconnection, which oversees a large grid in the Mid-Atlantic, ordered a power plant that burns coal and another that burns oil to stay open until 2029, four years past their planned retirement date, to reduce the risk of power outages. The move could ultimately cost utility customers in the area of <a href="https://opc.maryland.gov/Consumer-Learning/FERC-and-PJM-Issues" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than $720 million</a>.</p><p>“Coal plants are old and dirty, uncompetitive and unreliable,” said Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “The Trump administration is stuck in the past, trying to make utility customers pay more for yesterday’s energy. Instead, it should be doing all it can to build the electricity grid of the future.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Brad Plumer is a Times reporter who covers technology and policy efforts to address global warming.</p></div><div><p>Mira Rojanasakul is a Times reporter who uses data and graphics to cover climate and the environment.</p></div></div></div><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">The Trump Administration’s First 100 Days</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Gun Control </strong><strong>Roll Back</strong><strong>: </strong>The Trump administration is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-gun-control-measures.html">roll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures</a>, according to two people briefed on the move.</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S.-Iran Talks:</strong> Expected talks between Iran and the United States would be a late, and perhaps last, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/world/europe/iran-nuclear-sanctions-trump.html">opportunity to control Tehran’s nuclear ambitions</a> and avoid war.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drilling and Mining on Public Land:</strong> The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/climate/trump-new-mexico-nevada-mining-drilling.html">opened thousands of acres of land in Nevada and New Mexico</a> to oil and gas drilling, geothermal development and hard-rock mining, reversing protections that former President Biden enacted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harriet Tubman:</strong> A National Park Service web page about the Underground Railroad appeared to have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/national-park-service-harriet-tubman-underground-railroad-dei.html">restored to prominently show the abolitionist leader</a>, after it had been changed to remove a large photo and quotations from her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech C.E.O.s and Trump: </strong>With inauguration donations and Mar-a-Lago visits, leaders of the biggest tech companies sought favor with the president in an attempt to steer regulation and tariffs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/technology/tech-ceos-lobbying-trump.html">to little avail</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Female Military Leader Fired:</strong> The Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/trump-us-military-nato-official-fired-chatfield.html">fired Vice Adm.
