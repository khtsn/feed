		<p>this roster had so much potential. mostly sad they released shin and tomaszy</p>

		<p>tomaszys dream was to play with saadhak btw, that hurts even more.</p>

		<p>damn, and tomaszy is a good player too and both he and saadhak speak portuguese</p>

		<p>Ok this might sound weird, but technically tomaszy can still play with saadhak, the main reason would be that he could still do tryouts and come out on the top (like sh1n did last year) </p>

<p>unfortunate but it had to happen for the greater good, he should definitely be a second caller on the next t1 team he joins, good luck in your path bro. unfortunate that tomaszy couldnâ€™t play with saadhak, i hope they take him back but seems like theyâ€™ve already set their eyes on other players. maybe one day</p>
<p>KC saadhak incoming ðŸ‘€ </p>		</div>

			<p>Unlucky for Magnum, seems like they were willing to run it back, but of course you can&#39;t pass up on someone like Saadhak.</p>
<p>I would have been curious to see if he could have improved at midrounding.</p>		</div>

			<p>Doesn&#39;t matter, if you get to have one of the if not the best IGL in the history of Valorant, you get him.</p>

			<p>If youâ€™ve watched their games, you should notice that they look lost in the mid round and often donâ€™t know what to do outside of set strats, this change was unfortunate but needed</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think shin and tomaszy had to go tho, especially the latter :(</p>		</div>
