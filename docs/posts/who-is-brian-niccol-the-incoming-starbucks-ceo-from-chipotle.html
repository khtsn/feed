The company’s chief financial officer, Rachel Ruggeri, will serve as interim chief executive until Mr. Niccol officially joins the company on Sept. 9.</p><p>Starbucks’ shares soared on Tuesday after the announcement, rising about 20 percent as investors — including activist investment groups that have pushed the company to make changes — largely cheered the leadership pivot.</p><p>Here’s what to know about the incoming Starbucks leader.</p><h2 id="link-6b402c95">Chipotle saw rapid growth during his tenure.</h2><p>Mr. Niccol is coming off of six years at the helm of Chipotle Mexican Grill — a period that saw the fast-casual burrito chain nearly double its sales. The company’s stock price has increased about 800 percent since he took over in early 2018.</p></div></div><div><p>Much of that growth has stemmed from Mr. Niccol’s focus on opening more drive-through options and expanding the company’s loyalty program.</p></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="starbucks-chipotle-stock-price" data-id="100000009627013" data-source-id="100000009627013"><header id="interactive-header"><h2 id="interactive-headline">Chain Reactions</h2><p data-testid="leadin" id="interactive-leadin">Percentage change in share price since March 2018, when Brian Niccol became Chipotle’s C.E.O.</p></header></section></div><div><div><p>The expansion was a notable comeback for the burrito giant. When Mr. Niccol took over the company in 2018, he was immediately confronted with a test: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/business/chipotle-stock-earnings.html" title="">a string of food-borne illnesses</a> among Chipotle’s customers from 2015 to 2018 that resulted in the stock slump and distrust among consumers. As one of his first moves as chief executive, Mr. Niccol retrained the restaurant staff in food safety. About one year into the job, the chain’s stock price had surpassed its value when the food safety crisis began.</p><p>But some analysts are cautioning that Mr. Niccol faces even bigger hurdles as he gears up to boost sales at Starbucks, which is grappling with weakening results in some of its biggest markets, particularly the United States and China. </p><h2 id="link-3bb6f02d">His résumé is peppered with high-profile restaurant roles.</h2><p>Before joining Chipotle, Mr. Niccol spent three years as chief executive of Taco Bell, part of the fast food giant Yum! Brands. There, he introduced new menu items, sold off stores to franchisees and focused on digital efforts like mobile ordering, an approach he later carried over to Chipotle.</p></div></div><div><div><p>At Taco Bell, he also showcased his ability to revamp a brand’s reputation. A lawsuit filed in 2011 alleged that the company’s taco mixture was more filler than beef. The suit was ultimately withdrawn, but not before hurting Taco Bell’s sales and reputation. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chipotle-picks-taco-bell-ceo-brian-niccol-to-be-its-new-chief-1518557401" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Niccol helped</a> to revive Taco Bell in the public eye, with social media initiatives like a Snapchat taco lens.</p><p>That résumé stands in contrast to Mr. Narasimhan’s when he took over Starbucks last year. The former chief executive of Reckitt, which owns brands like Lysol and Air Wick, Mr. Narasimhan had little-to-no background in restaurant chains.</p><p>The shadow of Howard Schultz, who had three stints as chief executive of Starbucks, also continues to loom large over the chain. Mr. Schultz, who holds the title of chairman emeritus, was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/howardschultz_starbucks-announced-earnings-last-week-and-activity-7193044402255110144-y4mN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quick to criticize</a> the company’s performance and leadership during its recent struggles.</p><p>“The thing about Howard is that he has a big shadow,” said Sharon Zackfia, an analyst at the investment bank William Blair. “He has been a big figure in Starbucks for such a long time, the only person I can think of that’s out there who would be able to stay in the sun is Brian Niccol. He’s done such a phenomenal job at Chipotle. So, other than Howard coming back, there couldn’t be a better pick than Brian to lead Starbucks.”</p><h2 id="link-136e7662">He’s been criticized for opposing union drives.</h2><p>Labor relations are in the spotlight at Starbucks, which has faced mounting pressure from union officials and activists who accuse the company of illegally retaliating against workers and resisting contract negotiations. This year, under Mr. Narasimhan, Starbucks made progress toward bargaining a framework for a labor contract with union stores, and the company said that it hoped to wrap up the bargaining process with individual stores by the end of the year.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But under Mr. Niccol’s leadership, Chipotle has received criticism for offering what the Teamsters union called an “insulting” wage increase in contract negotiations with a store in Lansing, Mich. In 2022, Mr. Niccol said at a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipotle-ceo-disappointed-in-michigan-locations-decision-to-unionize-220936042.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWV0cm90aW1lcy5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH6AZtjjSQ0piKZc8SzX7TyZ0KPP3zhubZBqReW-zRb8iaVW7eaP2JPRV4A3yo2D8S40MLquNnDY_kVrWJW8yv5eNAOLkdINQZmZeSmjme9OVdj22OuvDNdLT3ZKm4cIiMj3BmlCiQLOKd6u9-cJYsMncFOwCBoFLBGvzWbxppJy" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance summit</a> that “I really don’t think we need a third party to get between our restaurant teams and our company,” but said he would work with the union.</p><p>That same year, the National Labor Relations Board found that Chipotle, with Mr. Niccol at the helm, violated federal labor law by closing a store in Augusta, Maine, that tried to form a union and firing workers.
