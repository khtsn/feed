                  <p><a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/11581/hotu" data-tooltip-id="uid1533557269">HOTU</a> have moved up eight places in the global VRS to 21st after a title-winning campaign at Roman Imperium Cup V that culminated in a revenge win against <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/13404/gentle-mates" data-tooltip-id="uid522117007">Gentle Mates</a>, who had won the same match-up in the IstanbuLAN final a week earlier.</p>
                  <p>It has been a steady climb for <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/11581/hotu" data-tooltip-id="uid1533557269">HOTU</a>, who were ranked outside the top 70 in the world when <a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/16612/n0rb3r7" data-tooltip-id="uid599641990">David <span>&#34;⁠n0rb3r7⁠&#34;</span> Danielyan</a> was recruited in August, initially on loan from <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/5378/virtuspro" data-tooltip-id="uid1846325954">Virtus.pro</a>.</p>
                  <p>&#34;I saw good potential in the team and decided to stay,&#34; he told HLTV after the final. &#34;Thanks to the organization for buying me out from VP.</p>
                  <p>&#34;We have good potential to qualify for tier-1 events, even the Major. We have good chances. We just need to do everything in the last month until the invites to the Major.&#34;</p>
                  <p>The 24-year-old said it would be &#34;everyone&#39;s dream&#34; to qualify for the Major, even for a Major winner like himself. &#34;It&#39;s been almost two years since I last played at a Major.&#34;</p>
                  <p>He added: &#34;Let&#39;s take PARIVISION. They played very well at the Major. Look at them now. They&#39;re tier-1. It&#39;s a good step for them.&#34;</p>
                  
                  <hr/>
                  <p><strong>Congratulations on winning the Roman Imperium Cup. Last week, you lost to Gentle Mates in the final. Today you got the revenge. How does it feel?</strong></p>
                  <p>It feels great, but if we had won the Istanbul one, it would have been much better.</p>
                  <p><strong>You smashed Gentle Mates on Anubis in Turkey last week. Today, it was open in the veto, but you went with Mirage instead. Did you try to catch them off guard with that?</strong></p>
                  <p>We showed everything on Anubis. We didn&#39;t want to play it again, and we wanted to, like, surprise them or just play another map. So we decided to pick Mirage, and it went well for us.</p>
                  <p><strong>They went again for a Nuke pick, where you didn&#39;t put up a fight. Why did you pick T side?</strong></p>
                  <p>As you said before, we played the final against them in Istanbul. We picked CT side and we won two rounds. We decided, &#39;Let&#39;s try something on the T side.&#39; But nothing worked at all. [laughs] We didn&#39;t even see them to shoot. So after the 13-0, we just said, &#39;Okay, guys, let&#39;s forget this map. Let&#39;s play Overpass.&#39;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>After that 13-0, you came out swinging on Overpass. What did you discuss outside to reset from that map and enter the last map mentally ready?</strong></p>
                  <p>We just said, &#39;We have everything to win. We just need to talk, to communicate well. Everyone needs to focus on the crosshair.&#39; We did it well, even though we lost some rounds that, from my perspective, were stupid rounds, but we managed to win the first half 8-4, and we just closed it out on the CT side.</p>
                  <p><strong>When you joined the team, back in August, it was ranked 70th in the world, approximately. It has been a steady climb since then, and you are now ranked just outside the top 20. What has been the secret?</strong></p>
                  <p>Maybe that we played very well in Stockholm in Pro League. I saw good potential in the team and decided to stay. Thanks to the organization for buying me out from VP. We have good potential to qualify for tier-1 events, even the Major. We have good chances. We just need to do everything in the last month until the invites to the Major.</p>
                  <p><strong>You’re still in the race for a Major spot. You have Myskill Pro League Series 2 and the BC Game Masters Championship coming up. Is the dream alive?</strong></p>
                  <p>Yes, of course. For the others, it would be their first Major. For me, it&#39;s been almost two years since I last played at a Major. For me, of course, it&#39;s a dream to play again at a Major. We will do everything we can to qualify for the Major.</p>
                  <div>
                    <p>It&#39;s just sad that it has turned out this way</p>
                    
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>What would it mean, especially to the young guys, to qualify for the Major?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think it&#39;s everyone&#39;s dream to have a sticker in the game. It would be important for them because it&#39;s a big opportunity. Let&#39;s take PARIVISION. They played very well at the Major. Look at them now. They&#39;re tier-1. It&#39;s a good step for them.</p>
                  <p><strong>I wanted to ask you about VP. They&#39;re now going through another rebuild, with mir as the IGL. fame and FL1T are on the bench. What are your thoughts? What should they do to be competitive again?</strong></p>
                  <p>[Laughs] Tough question. For me, it&#39;s sad to see them losing everything like this. I don&#39;t know. The easiest way would be to buy a core. I don&#39;t know who can join VP because everyone is under contract on teams or on the bench. They need money to buy them. I really don&#39;t know. For me, it&#39;s just sad that it has turned out this way.</p>
