In the United States, which bans imports of haggis with sheep lung, some Americans of Scottish heritage <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/business/haggis-smuggling.html" title="">have turned to the black market</a> to get their hands on the real thing.</p><p>Now <a href="https://www.macsween.co.uk/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Macsween</a>, one of the more popular makers of haggis in Scotland, has developed a recipe that would meet U.S. import guidelines by replacing sheep lung with lamb heart. It’s not the first modification that Macsween, which was founded in Edinburgh in 1953, has made to its haggis. In a nod to modern tastes, it has swapped the sheep stomach that has traditionally been used as a haggis casing for a beef casing, like those used in some sausages.</p><p>“Do I think there’s something to be said for textural difference that the lung adds to it? Yes,” said Greg Brockman, a butcher in Brooklyn who has made his own version of haggis for years. “Do I think the average consumer is going to notice? Probably not.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The new take on the delicacy is slated to arrive in the United States by this time next year, in time to be the centerpiece at Burns Night celebrations.</p><p>Burns helped turn haggis, which was traditionally consumed by peasants, into Scotland’s national dish with lines like “Fair fa’ your honest, sonsie face / Great chieftain o’ the pudding-race!” in his poem “<a href="https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/address-haggis/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Address to a Haggis</a>,” which is read as part of the celebrations.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
