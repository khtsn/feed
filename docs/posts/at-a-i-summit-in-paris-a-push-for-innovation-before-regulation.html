No,” Mr. Macron insisted as he urged Europe to invest heavily in its own A.I. abilities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“We respect and want to work with the United States, we want to work with China, but we don’t want to depend on anyone,” he later added.</p><p>Attendees at the summit, which runs through Tuesday, include Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI; Zhang Guoqing, China’s vice premier; and Vice President JD Vance, who is on his first trip overseas.</p><p>France sees the summit as a crucial moment to spur A.I. investment in Europe, to get consumers on board with the fast-moving technology and to position Europe as a top contender — not just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/technology/eu-ai-act-regulation.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">a leading regulator</a> — in a global competition where the United States and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/world/asia/china-deepseek-education.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">China</a> are so far the biggest players.</p><p>At similar gatherings in other countries, the focus was often on A.I.’s potential risks in terms of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/special-series/ai-transform-global-economy.html?searchResultPosition=5" title="">economic upheaval</a>, disinformation and national security — like a 2023 summit in Britain <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/europe/uk-ai-summit-sunak.html?searchResultPosition=4" title="">that warned of the technology’s potentially “catastrophic” harm</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>President Emmanuel Macron of France, second right, meeting with China’s vice premier, Zhang Guoqing, second left, at the A.I. summit in Paris.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Pool photo by Mohammad Badra</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Those concerns remain. “So much of the last decade has been a story of technology tearing us apart,” Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science at Stanford and co-director at the university’s Human-Centered A.I. Institute, said in the summit’s opening comments. “A.I. is at another fork in this road.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>But the global mood has also shifted as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/health/ai-patient-messages-mychart.html" title="">A.I. becomes widespread</a>, and countries jostle to build the technology’s next giant.</p><p>Last month, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/technology/trump-openai-stargate-artificial-intelligence.html" title="">announced</a> the so-called Stargate initiative that could eventually invest as much as $500 billion over the next four years in computing infrastructure to power A.I. And China shocked the tech world with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html" title="">DeepSeek</a>, a company that developed powerful artificial intelligence at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts.</p><p>“If we want growth, jobs and progress, we have to allow innovators to innovate, builders to build and developers to develop,” Mr. Altman <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2025/02/08/sam-altman-pdg-d-openai-sur-l-intelligence-artificielle-la-france-a-mis-en-place-une-strategie-que-d-autres-pays-europeens-devraient-suivre_6537698_3232.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in an opinion essay</a> in the French newspaper Le Monde on Saturday. “The risk of inaction is too great to ignore.”</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" title="">sued</a> OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Mr. Macron’s priority is ensuring that Europe does not fall behind the United States and China by overregulating its development.</p><p>He acknowledged the need for regulation — for instance, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/arts/music/record-labels-ai-lawsuit-sony-universal-warner.html?searchResultPosition=8" title="">protect intellectual property</a> — but also pitched his fellow citizens on the benefits of A.I., calling it “a technological and scientific revolution like few we’ve seen before” and a “moment of opportunity for mankind.”</p><p>“If we regulate before we innovate, we won’t have any innovation of our own,” he said.</p><p>Investors at the conference shared his view, but warned that Europe was not as competitive as the United States or China because it had layers of regulations, higher taxes and fewer financial incentives.</p><p>France, Mr. Macron argued, is well positioned to lead Europe’s A.I. push, partly because it gets about 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy, allowing it to support power-hungry data centers without jeopardizing its climate change goals.</p><p>He added that more than 100 billion euros in A.I.-related investments in France would be announced during the summit, including <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/02/06/uae-to-invest-billions-in-france-ai-data-center_6737871_7.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a deal</a> with the United Arab Emirates to fund an A.I. data center and campus in France.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-10"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Inside the Paris office of Mistral, France’s leading A.I. start-up.

It is one of more than 60 companies that have joined an <a href="https://aichampions.eu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">E.U. A.I. Champions Initiative</a> calling on Europe to become an A.I. global leader.</p><p>As one of the world’s biggest defense equipment makers, Airbus has increasingly integrated A.I. into its defense applications, raising ethical questions.</p><p>At the summit, Guillaume Faury, Airbus’s chief executive, acknowledged that “things are moving so fast,” but said that global leaders needed to make sure that A.I. “has to be good for society.”</p><p>That includes not letting A.I. take the driver’s seat, he added. “Keeping the human in the loop for us is essential — having someone who’s a human being be accountable,” Mr. Faury said.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Liz Alderman is the chief European business correspondent, writing about economic, social and policy developments around Europe.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/liz-alderman">More about Liz Alderman</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
