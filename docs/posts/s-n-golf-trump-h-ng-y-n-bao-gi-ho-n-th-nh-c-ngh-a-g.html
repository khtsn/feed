Mr. Musk has been using the group to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-money.html" title="">spend millions of dollars</a> to elect a conservative candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court in an April 1 election.</p><p>The petition reads: “Judges should interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas. By signing below, I’m rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role — interpreting, not legislating.”</p><p>The purpose of the petition is multifaceted: Drive attention from the news media, increase awareness and voter registration among conservative voters, and help America PAC collect data on the most energized Wisconsinites who are likely to turn out for the conservative candidate, Brad Schimel. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Mr. Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/elon-musk-47-dollars-petition.html" title="">carried out a nearly identical maneuver</a> in battleground states before the November election, generating significant legal and political debate.</p><p>The Philadelphia district attorney sued to stop the distribution of those lottery-style payouts, which went up to $1 million to voters who signed a document in support of the First Amendment. But the day before Election Day, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/elon-musk-america-pac-sweepstakes-ruling.html" title="">a Pennsylvania judge declined</a> to halt the sweepstakes.</p><p>America PAC’s revival of the use of petitions, and the wording of its new document in Wisconsin, reveal two of Mr. Musk’s priorities as he wields wide power in Washington.</p><p>The first is his focus on the court election in Wisconsin, which could swing control of the state’s top judicial body back to conservatives after liberals won a major victory there in 2023. Mr. Musk’s super PAC and an allied nonprofit group have spent over $11 million to try to elect Judge Schimel, which would again push the battleground state rightward on issues like redistricting and abortion rights.</p><p>Mr. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, has also <a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/tesla-wisconsin-court-blocking-opening-dealerships" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued Wisconsin to challenge a state law</a> prohibiting manufacturers from owning dealerships. In January, eight days after Tesla filed the suit, Mr. Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1882394525743927403" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, “Very important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The second is Mr. Musk’s budding obsession with removing judges he sees as thwarting President Trump’s agenda. He posts daily on X about his frustrations with the federal judiciary, and the refreshed language of the new petition points to that focus.</p><p>But despite the petition from Mr. Musk’s group denouncing judges who are openly political, there are few doubts about where the loyalties of his preferred candidate in Wisconsin lie: Judge Schimel is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/brad-schimel-trump-wisconsin-supreme-court.html" title="">a longtime defender of Mr. Trump</a> who dressed up as the president last Halloween.</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">U.S. Politics: News and Analysis</h2><h3>Here’s a look at the political landscape across America.</h3><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Town Halls:</strong> As President Trump and Elon Musk continue their push to shrink the federal government at breathtaking speed, town halls in Republican districts have erupted with an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/republicans-town-halls.html">outpouring of anxiety, complaints and anger</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Starting the 2028 Chatter Early:</strong> Pete Buttigieg says he’s keeping his options open.
