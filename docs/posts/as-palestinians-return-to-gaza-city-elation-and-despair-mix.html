But the return home was also shocking and depressing: Israel’s bombing campaign flattened entire neighborhoods, making them barely recognizable piles of rubble.</p><p>“We’re overcome with joy — we’re finally in our neighborhood near friends and family after a year living on the sidewalk and the sand,” said Rajab al-Sindawi, a 49-year-old secondhand clothing salesman from Gaza City, who had traveled to Rafah, Deir al Balah and Nuseirat after leaving the north. “But our home is gone and it feels like our future is gone, too.”</p><p>The mass return to northern Gaza commenced after Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza’s coastal road on Monday under the terms of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, and allowed displaced people to move north.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from northern Gaza <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/world/middleeast/gaza-evacuation-israel.html" title="">fled south</a> at the start of Israel’s military offensive against Hamas.

Israeli forces caused immense damage to apartment blocks, hospitals and schools — places Israel accused Hamas militants of exploiting for military purposes and using to hide among civilians.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Adam Rasgon is a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-rasgon">More about Adam Rasgon</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
