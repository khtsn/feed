    <h1>The Stakes on Immigration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Nine years after Donald Trump’s rise in American politics, the stakes on immigration may seem clear enough. Trump wants a harsh crackdown on illegal immigration, with a border wall and mass deportations. Kamala Harris wants an approach that balances border security with human rights considerations.</p><p>That broad framing gets many things right, but it also masks some nuance and overlap between the two candidates. Consider: Trump says he wants to increase at least some forms of legal immigration. And Harris supports a bill that would help build the wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Those are not the positions voters typically hear from either candidate.</p><p>The Morning is running a series in which we explain how the government would work differently under Harris or Trump. In this installment, I focus on immigration.</p><h2 id="link-30c0e09c">Their records</h2><p><strong>Trump:</strong> Since he entered politics in 2015, no issue has animated Trump like immigration.</p><p>When he was in the White House, he built parts of the wall. He enacted a travel ban focused on Muslim countries. He separated families who crossed the border, in an attempt to deter future migrants. He worked with Mexico to stop people from entering the U.S. He closed the border to nonessential travel during the Covid pandemic.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>But he has also fought immigration restrictions for his own political benefit. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of senators proposed a bill that would have limited asylum — a major source of undocumented immigration — and hired more border guards, among other changes. Trump called on Republican lawmakers to oppose the bill because he worried it would prevent him from running on immigration if President Biden fixed the problem.</p><p><strong>Harris:</strong> Vice President Harris comes from an administration with a shifting record on immigration.</p><p>At first, Biden relaxed rules. He undid many of Trump’s policies and spoke warmly about migrants. The number of illegal border crossings soared.</p><p>When it became clear the surge was hurting Democrats in the polls, the administration started to crack down. After the border security bill failed to pass Congress, Biden signed an executive order in June that has largely blocked asylum seekers. Illegal entries plummeted.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>Biden also put Harris in charge of helping address the root causes of illegal immigration. This position was not really “border czar,” as Harris’s critics claim. She worked with Latin American countries to boost their economies and bring down crime, making it less likely that people would want to come to the United States.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Harris has changed her position on some immigration issues. She no longer supports decriminalizing illegal border crossings, as she did in her 2020 presidential campaign. That move reflects her tougher shift on immigration overall.</p><h2 id="link-4d0894bc">Their plans</h2><p><strong>Trump:</strong> If he wins, Trump has promised a tougher crackdown on immigration than he carried out in his first term.</p><p>Besides finishing the wall, he has said he will mount the “largest deportation effort in American history.” He said last week that his crackdown will begin in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colo., which have recently been at the center of false and hyperbolic claims about immigration. He would push the military and law enforcement to deport millions of undocumented immigrants across the country.</p><p>But he has not answered questions about the specifics: Would law enforcement go door to door? How would officials identify migrants? Would there be protections to ensure that legal immigrants and citizens aren’t deported, as happened in a previous mass deportation campaign in the 1950s?</p><p>Trump has taken a few immigration-friendly positions, such as promising a green card to college graduates who are not citizens. He made similar remarks in 2016 and, while in office, actually reduced legal immigration. But many economists worry that mass deportations would shrink the work force, hurting the economy. Trump could address those concerns with a plan to bring more workers to the U.S. legally.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p><strong>Harris:</strong> Harris has cast herself as tough on the border, embracing the bipartisan bill that Trump helped defeat this year. That measure would fund the wall, give the president new powers to restrict border crossings and modestly expand legal immigration.</p><p>For Harris, this is a balancing act. Democrats have battled Trump’s agenda and taken a friendlier stance on immigration. But polls show that Americans see the border as out of control, and many now support the wall and mass deportations. Harris is trying to get her party to face that political reality.</p><p>That still involves <em>some</em> immigration-friendly positions. Harris, for example, supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But Democrats would likely need to control the House and the Senate to make it happen. If Republicans control any part of Congress, Harris could end up with only the more restrictive parts of her agenda.</p><h2 id="link-7cbb2416">Different visions</h2><p>What would all these policies add up to? Trump would likely leave the country with far fewer immigrants, with big effects across American life and the economy. Harris would enact more modest changes, taking steps to stop illegal immigration without mass deportations. That situation likely wouldn’t be too different from the one today, now that border crossings have fallen under Biden.</p><h2 id="link-3c1c6048">For more</h2><ul><li><p>Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/trump-long-island-rally.html" title="">at a rally in New York</a>, said he would visit Springfield and Aurora, two towns he has mentioned in false claims about immigration.</p></li><li><p>Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/harris-immigration-deportation-trump.html" title="">criticized Trump’s mass deportation plan</a> at a Congressional Hispanic Caucus event, promising to change what she called a “broken” immigration system.</p></li><li><p>Biden <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4887536-biden-trump-rhetoric-hispanic-month/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denounced Trump’s comments about immigrants</a> “poisoning the blood” of the country, The Hill reports. “We’re a nation of immigrants and that’s why we’re so damn strong,” he said.</p></li><li><p>Long before he accused Haitian immigrants of eating pets, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/trump-haitians.html" title="">said Haitians “all have AIDS”</a> and spoke derisively about the country. </p></li></ul><section data-id="100000009700675" data-testid="capsule-block"><h2 id="link-22e2b88a">The Stakes</h2><p><em>A Morning newsletter series on how the government might work under Trump or Harris.</em></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/briefing/the-stakes-on-presidential-power.html" title="">Presidential power</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/briefing/tax-election-harris-trump.html" title="">Taxes</a></p></li></ul></section></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><h3 id="link-28ff4c69"><span><strong>THE LATEST NEWS</strong></span></h3><h2 id="link-383c2e6b">U.S. Economy</h2><ul><li><p>The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by half a percentage point, a sharp cut that suggests central bank officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/economy/fed-reserve-interest-rate-cut.html" title="">are confident that inflation is fading</a>.</p></li><li><p>This was the Fed’s first rate cut since early 2020.
