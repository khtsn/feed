For decades, American officials have obsessed over getting hold of him.</p><p>The transfer came as a high-level delegation from Mexico arrived in Washington to meet with senior U.S. officials on a security agreement at a moment of tension between the nations. It was hailed in American law enforcement circles as a major victory and a clear signal that Mexico’s president planned to cooperate with the Trump administration in cracking down on the cartels.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/americas/mexico-trump-cartels-washington.html" title="">Inside the White House, there are also tensions.</a> Some U.S. officials have pushed for unilateral military action against the cartels. Others have argued for increased partnership with the Mexican government, in part to ensure cooperation on migration.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Sgt.

An earlier executive order by President Trump had asserted that being transgender “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful and disciplined lifestyle.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has described trans troops as “weird” and “a distraction.”</p><p>Some service members are challenging the policy in court. My colleague Dave Philipps interviewed dozens of transgender service members — three pilots, an explosives expert, a special operations officer, a nuclear reactor supervisor and others — who said their military experience looked nothing like the portrayal of them in the political arena. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/transgender-military-ban-trump-hegseth.html" title="">Read about their experience</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A new building within a Myanmar scam center in February. </span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Lauren DeCicca for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-477b435">Southeast Asia’s scam centers keep flourishing</h2><p>Hundreds of people were rescued in recent days from forced-labor facilities in Myanmar that were dedicated to a multibillion-dollar industry of online scams.

She began by cold-calling buyers and insisting that they order authentic bowls and plates. Now, she’s the main supplier of Japanese knives and tableware for several of New York’s finest restaurants.</p><p>Have an influential evening.</p><hr/><p><strong><em>Thanks for reading.
