By about 1 p.m., the town’s narrow cobblestone streets were already filled with several inches of water. By 2 p.m., a muddy tide nearly reached the windows of the town’s low homes as the Magro spilled over its banks. Trash cans and cars drifted about like toy boats. By 3 p.m., the mayor said that he had alerted the firefighters and the military emergency unit.</p><p>“Everyone knew that we were drowning,” said the mayor, Ricardo Gabaldón.</p><p>Yet the regional authorities failed to alert towns and villages a few dozen miles lower down the Magro that the river was raging and coming their way, mayors said. Hours later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/climate/spain-valencia-floods.html" title="">it hit those places, too</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I don’t know why they didn’t warn us,” said José Javier Sanchis Bretones, the mayor of Algemesí, which was flooded in the evening, killing at least three people there.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>The exact reasons for the delay are unclear. Some officials suggest the severity of the downpour and the potential ramifications were difficult to foresee. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/world/europe/spain-floods-valencia-volunteers.html" title="">But among residents, anger is seething</a> as they ask whether such a calamity had to be so deadly and why they were not alerted in time.</p><p>More than two weeks later, residents are still clearing mud that covered anything below eye level in several towns around Valencia. They are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/world/europe/spain-flash-floods-photos.html" title="">mourning the at least 221 people</a> who died in the flooding. Seven are still missing. Many streets remain impassable, clogged with debris. Thousands of businesses and homeowners have lost everything.</p><p>The flooding was no doubt the kind of extraordinary weather event that climate change is making both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/europe/spain-flash-floods.html#link-51196009" title="">less extraordinary and more unpredictable</a>. Yet the disaster exposed glaring delays by the authorities in alerting the population.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><p>Weather and river-monitoring agencies issued repeated warnings starting early in the day to the regional authorities about torrential rains and dangerously high water levels in usually empty or low rivers and ravines.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Residents of a southern suburb of Valencia in a home gutted by floodwaters.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Emilio Morenatti/Associated Press</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>While those warnings did not anticipate the full extent of the threat, the downpour’s disastrous scope quickly became clear. By midday, an official with the national weather agency said on Spanish television that in one area, the rains amounted to five gallons of water per square foot.</p><p>The torrent presented a danger to people living downstream, the official warned, because floods could inundate them even though it was not raining in their area, creating a false sense of security.</p><p>Still, the Valencia regional authorities, who are in charge of managing such emergencies, say they did not have enough information to realize the magnitude of the threat.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“If we did not have the information, we could not act,” said Salomé Pradas, the regional official in charge of managing emergencies.</p><p>Yet Ms. Pradas acknowledged that she was made aware of the existence of an emergency text-messaging system to alert the population only at 8 p.m. that evening, even though the regional government had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241107211230/https://comunica.gva.es/es/detalle?id=374220561&amp;site=373422856" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put the system in place in 2023</a>. The president of the Valencia region dismissed Ms. Pradas this past week.</p><p>Only at 8:11 p.m. did a general alert go out urging people to find shelter. By then, many residents were up to their chins in water.</p><p>“When the alert came, my grandpa had already drowned,” said Carlos Cervera, 37, a resident of the town of Paiporta, close to the coast, where more than 50 people died.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-11"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div></div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/11/autossell/door/door--superJumbo.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">Jose Paredes, a 39-year-old resident of Paiporta in the region of Valencia, captured water seeping through his door.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><h2 id="link-43d25839">‘Already Looking Bad’</h2><p>A lawyer, Mr. Gabaldón, the mayor of Utiel, woke up at 6 a.m. that Tuesday in October and saw violent rain pounding his window.

By 1:49 p.m., her road was submerged.

Do I let them die and start looking for the other mayors’ phone number, who I don’t even know who they are?” the mayor said.</p><p>“I already had enough to do taking care of my citizens,” he added.</p><p>Despite his efforts, rescuers could not save everyone in his town.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>A few yards from Ms. Arenas, a wave of water reached the window of a neighbor, Ángel Miota, 83, a retired truck driver.

She finally managed to extract him through a bathroom window. He came out with broken ribs and a wounded leg.</p><p>As bad as things were in Utiel, the heavy rains inland from the coast were not limited to the Magro.</p><p>The extraordinary downpours also fell around the source of another watercourse, the Rambla del Poyo, an arroyo or gorge that originates inland and passes the sprawling, densely populated suburbs of Valencia.</p><p>But in the towns lower down, the sky was clear. Life was going on mostly as usual.</p><h2 id="link-66eed520">‘People Are Going to Die’</h2><p>In commuter towns just outside Valencia, like Paiporta, construction workers were laboring on buildings by the riverbed, which was empty. A few residents were returning from the hairdresser. Older people were sitting in their traditional ground-floor apartments, which have internal courtyards, decorated with arches, columns and colorful tiles.</p><p>Paiporta is downstream on the Rambla del Poyo. The water level had risen before, and nothing made anyone think that this time would be exceptional, the mayor, María Isabel Albalat, said. It had not even rained there that day.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div><p>She was alerted to the threat, she said, only about 6 p.m., after a town employee drove past the channel in Paiporta and told her that the water was running high.</p><p>She returned to her home on the central street of San Roque by 6:30 p.m., she recalled. The floods had already arrived. Quickly, the ground floor of her home was filled with nearly six and a half feet of water.</p><p>She picked up the phone, she said, and called Pilar Bernabé, the Spanish government’s representative in Valencia.</p><p>“My town is flooding, and many people are going to die,” Ms. Albalat said she told her.</p><p>It was just after 7 p.m., and Ms. Bernabé was in an emergency committee meeting with the regional and local authorities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>About the same time, Juan Mandingorra, 93, a resident of Paiporta, called his son to say that water was gushing inside his house. His son tried to go to him, but the water was already too high, another relative said. Cars were floating in the streets, residents recalled, some with people screaming inside.</p><p>Around 7:30 p.m., Mr. Mandingorra drowned in his living room, said Mr. Cervera, his grandson.</p><p>Still, the emergency committee continued its meeting for nearly another hour, discussing issues concerning the region’s rivers and dams, said a Spanish government official who requested anonymity to speak about the gathering.</p><p>Finally, at 8:11 p.m., the committee issued a general alert. Everyone’s phone rang. “Any type of movement in the province of Valencia should be avoided,” the alert said.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Paiporta, just outside the city of Valencia, after the floods.

Five people died on her street alone, including a baby and her mother, Ms. Albalat noted. “I don’t know why they did not warn us,” she added, referring to the authorities.</p><h2 id="link-3e0fed44">The Blame Game</h2><p>It remains unclear why it took the regional government in Valencia until 5 p.m. to convene an emergency coordination meeting, and why it took it another three hours for it to send out a mass alert.</p><p>The regional government in Valencia has blamed the Júcar Hydrographic Confederation, the body in charge of monitoring the area’s water basins. The confederation is controlled by the Spanish national government.</p><p>Ms. Pradas, the regional emergency management official, said on Spanish television that she learned the Magro had flooded only when the mayor of Utiel told her around 2 p.m. She said that the Júcar confederation had not warned of the “worrisome volumes of water” before then.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-18"><p>The regional authorities also said that they did not learn that the Rambla del Poyo was threatening to overflow until it was already breaching its banks.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-38"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A supermarket in Paiporta.

Records it shared with The New York Times showed that the Júcar confederation and other monitoring bodies continued to send messages to the authorities about heavy rains and higher-than-usual watercourse levels, including in the Magro and the Rambla del Poyo, repeatedly throughout the day.</p><p>A spokesman for Spain’s environment ministry, which oversees the confederation, said that, given the information available, the regional government should have summoned the emergency committee by midday, instead of waiting until 5 p.m.</p><p>Even after the committee convened, Carlos Mazón, the president of the Valencia region, arrived more than two hours late, according to the Spanish government official who had knowledge of the meeting.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>The regional government did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Mazón’s absence.</p><h2 id="link-3ac7e558">Mud and Wounds</h2><p>In the towns destroyed by the flooding, few were willing to accept that there was nothing their politicians could have done to warn them.</p><p>“It was impossible to stop the water,” said Andreu Salom, the mayor of L’Alcúdia, a town on the Magro where at least two people died. “But warning and alerting would have saved lives,” he added. “I have no doubt about that.”</p><p>Since the flooding, tens of thousands have protested in Valencia, some demanding the resignation of Mr. Mazón. But residents have mostly devoted efforts to cleaning up after the devastation and to mourning the dead.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-42"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>A demonstration in Valencia this month denouncing the handling of the flooding.
