Chaos was breaking out again: Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, had notified Harvard that its permission to enroll international students was revoked. With that, the degrees and futures of thousands of Harvard students — and an integral piece of the university’s identity and culture — were plunged into deep uncertainty.</p><p>“There are so many students from all over the world who came to Harvard to make it a better place and to change America and change their home countries for the better,” said Karl Molden, a student from Vienna who had just completed his sophomore year. “Now it’s all at risk of falling apart, which is breaking my heart.”</p><p>The university has faced rapid-fire aggressions since its president, Alan M. Garber, told the Trump administration in April that Harvard would not give in to demands to change its hiring and admissions practices and its curriculum. After the government froze more than $2 billion in grants, Harvard filed suit in federal court in Boston. Since then, the administration has gutted the university’s research funding, upending budgets and forcing some hard-hit programs to reimagine their scope and mission.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>The end of international enrollment would transform a university where 6,800 students, more than a quarter of the total, come from other countries, <a href="https://oneworld.worldwide.harvard.edu/international-students-at-harvard/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a number that has grown steadily</a> in recent decades. Graduate programs would be hit especially hard.</p><p>At the Kennedy School, 59 percent of students come from outside the United States. International students make up 40 percent of the enrollment at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health and 35 percent at the Harvard Business School.</p><p>Because international students do not qualify for federal financial aid, and typically pay more for their education, they contribute disproportionately to the university’s revenue, in addition to bringing diverse perspectives that enrich campus life and classroom discussions.</p><p>“This will destroy the university as we know it,” said Kirsten Weld, a professor who specializes in Latin American history and the president of the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors. “Harvard is situated in the United States physically, but its students and faculty hail from all over the world. That is fundamental to the work and mission of the institution. You cannot take that away and have an institution left at the end of it.”</p><p>Fear and confusion spread quickly on Thursday as international students flooded group message boards with anxious questions and refreshed their email inboxes. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Sarah Davis, a second-year Kennedy School student from Australia who is scheduled to graduate next week, said she did not feel fully confident that she would receive her master’s degree in public administration if her student visa had been rendered invalid.</p><p>And even if she does receive her degree, Ms. Davis said, it is unlikely that she will be able to stay in the United States for her planned post-graduation employment. It is contingent on continued sponsorship by Harvard under the government’s <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Optional Practical Training</a> program, which permits universities to sponsor the visas of international students for as long as three years after they graduate.</p><p>“It’s incredibly disappointing to have something you’ve worked so hard for be taken away in an instant,” Ms. Davis said, “and to end up in limbo.”</p><p>Mr. Molden said he had broken out in a sweat as he read about the administration’s action.</p><p>“Getting into Harvard was the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life,” he said. “I can’t actually believe that this is happening.”</p><p>Alfred Williamson, 20, a student from Wales who just completed his freshman year, said that he and many of his international friends had already started to think about transferring to other universities.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>“I was messaging a friend from the U.K., asking if we could talk about whether we could transfer to Oxford or Cambridge,” Mr. Williamson said. “People are taking this very seriously.”</p><p>“Everyone’s freaking out,” he added. “No one knows what to do.”</p><p>Yet even students who had already begun to consider leaving found themselves overwhelmed by the prospect of quickly finding a spot elsewhere — and by the idea of leaving a place where they had invested so much.</p><p>“To watch my dream and those of my international peers be turned into a nightmare is one of the hardest experiences of my life,” Ella Ricketts, a freshman from Canada, said in a text message. “The thought of leaving the Harvard community — the place where I feel most at home — remains almost impossible to consider.”</p><p>Canada, China, India, Britain and South Korea are <a href="https://worldwide.harvard.edu/worldwide-data#%3Cp%20class%3D%22bubble-top-text%22%3E53%25%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cp%20class%3D%22bubble-bottom-text%22%3EGraduate%20School%20of%20Design%3C%2Fp%3E" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">among the countries</a> that send the largest numbers of students to Harvard, according to university data.</p><p>Genia Lukin, a Ph.D. student from Israel in Harvard’s psychology department, said that the Trump administration’s latest pressure tactic — deployed, like the rest, in the name of combating antisemitism — would further harm people like her who have experienced antisemitism and anti-Israel bias on Harvard’s campus.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“This is not helping,” Ms. Lukin said.</p><p>The new crackdown seemed to throw the future of some programs into question. Jose Ignacio Llodra, a student from Chile who is set to graduate next week from the Kennedy School, estimated that 90 percent of students in his master’s program had come from overseas.</p><p>“The program is about how to bring international development to countries around the world — without international students, it doesn’t make sense,” Mr. Llodra said. “Many of us came to the U.S. to study because the university system is the best in the world, and this policy might destroy this system.”</p><p>He said he was lucky that his student visa had been sponsored by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is about to receive a master’s degree in business administration.</p><p>Maria Kuznetsova, a graduate student from Russia, said the announcement on Thursday had reminded her of things she experienced in her home country.</p><p>“In the student chat groups, people are saying, ‘Don’t panic — it’s too early,’” said Ms. Kuznetsova, who is considering a move to Europe while also quickly applying for jobs in America in hopes of securing a work visa. “But I think that’s detrimental, because then you don’t prepare for the worst.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Caleb N. Thompson, 20, an American student who serves as one of two presidents of Harvard’s undergraduate student body, said the Trump administration’s demands were a “blatant and unacceptable attack on our student body.”</p><p>“All of our classes are going to be affected, all of our clubs are going to be affected,” he said. “Student life cannot be the way that it is if we do not have international students.”</p><p>Some students expressed confidence that the university would fight for them to stay. Others grappled with their apparent sudden powerlessness over the most basic facets of their lives — where they would live, study and work.</p><p>“We’re being used like pawns in some game we have no control over,” Mr. Williamson said.</p><p>Stephanie Saul<!-- --> and <!-- -->Steven Rich<!-- --> contributed reporting</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Jenna Russell is the lead reporter covering New England for The Times.
