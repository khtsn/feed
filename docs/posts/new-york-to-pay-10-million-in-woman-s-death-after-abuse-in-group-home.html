Workers retaliated against Z.O. by withholding her daily constipation medicine, according to court papers, and she eventually died in a hospital from complications of massive bowel obstruction.</p><p>Now, five years after the original settlement, the state will pay Z.O.’s family an additional $10 million.</p><p>“The state failed this woman in every possible way,” said Ilann M. Maazel, a lawyer who brought the lawsuits over the treatment of the woman, in a news release. “Staff abused and neglected her and then, as if that were not enough, they killed her.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Erin Silk, a spokeswoman for the state’s Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, which oversees the state’s more than 1,000 group homes, said in a statement that the agency’s highest priorities are “providing high-quality services and keeping people safe.”</p><p>“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Z.O. We believe this resolution is in the best interests of all parties involved,” Ms. Silk wrote.</p><div><div><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
