It’s Kamala, not ‘Kazam.’” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><blockquote><p>“And so, dear Christmas Eve voter, I say to you: Things aren’t that bad, but they might get a hell of a lot worse under the rule of a mad king. Do I love everything about Kamala? No. Who told you you get to love everything? Do I wish she came up with a better reason to be president than ‘I’m not Trump’? Yeah, it would have been very helpful. But let’s not forget, ‘I’m not Trump’ is still a really great reason.” <em>— BILL MAHER</em></p><p>“But things look so good for Trump, Democrats have already impeached him.” <em>— GREG GUTFELD</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><blockquote><p>“The Harris campaign is cautioning against getting too excited. Too late! I have to be excited because I’ve only got two other choices: absolute terror or Absolut vodka.” <em>— STEPHEN COLBERT</em></p><p>“If you see someone in the fetal position drenched in sweat, they either just ran the New York City Marathon or they’re waiting for tomorrow’s election.” <em>— JIMMY FALLON</em></p><p>“Look, I love this country. I’m an immigrant — I chose to be here. In the words of the late Lee Greenwood, I’m proud to be an American. And I’d argue there is nothing more American than having a healthy adversarial relationship with those in power, even if you voted for them.” <em>— JOHN OLIVER</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><h2 id="link-1e207ca5">The Punchiest Punchlines (Hot Mic Edition)</h2><blockquote><p>“Former President Trump held a rally on Friday in Wisconsin and appeared to simulate oral sex on a microphone stand.
