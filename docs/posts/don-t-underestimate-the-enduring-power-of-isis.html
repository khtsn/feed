The assailant said shortly before the attack that he had joined the Islamic State, the brutal terrorist movement that at one point controlled an area in the Middle East the size of Britain.</p><p>In its heyday, ISIS marketed itself as offering what one fighter called a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/09/how-isis-attracts-foreign-fighters-the-state-of-terror-book" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five-star jihad</a>,” promising recruits a paradoxical mix of religious authenticity and material rewards, from free housing to a glamorous new identity to access to wives. At its height, it was the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-uncovered/isis-richest-terror-group-world-n326781" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wealthiest</a> terrorist organization in modern history.</p><p>Today, while the ISIS caliphate is gone, the group has cells and affiliates scattered across <a href="https://icct.nl/publication/global-strategy-address-islamic-state-africa" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Africa</a>, Southeast Asia, Afghanistan and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/15/opinion/al-assad-syria-isis.html" title="">Syria</a>. It maintains an active online presence, and is still a threat: With the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the authorities are concerned about a potential resurgence by ISIS there, while an offshoot in Afghanistan, ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for a significant attack last year <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/24/1240488528/isis-k-moscow-concert-attack-explained" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Russia</a> and is believed to be behind <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/middleeast/us-isis-iran-general-suleimani.html" title="">another in Iran</a>.</p><p>But the twisted heart of the utopia ISIS was trying to build, and all that it claimed to offer, no longer exists. So why would the group’s extreme ideology — rejected by the overwhelming majority of the world’s Muslims — appeal to a down-on-his-luck American veteran, five years after the caliphate’s fall?</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>For 20 years, I’ve been studying Western recruits to domestic and transnational terrorist organizations. I’ve interviewed jihadis, white-nationalist terrorists and eco-terrorists to understand their motivations and to prevent future violence. In my view, the appeal of some of the most crucial elements that ISIS offered to vulnerable or confused Western recruits — doctrinal certainty, identity, redemption and revenge — are as strong as ever, and will continue to resonate with people who can find it online.</p><p>Most of us, as adults, live in a state of spiritual confusion and uncertainty. We rarely get to choose between good and evil but often face a frustrating choice between actions that lead to marginally better or worse consequences. Rewards for good behavior are often ephemeral, and punishment for bad decisions is mostly of our own making.</p><p>To some, ISIS offered a seductive alternative: moral certitude, backed by brutal enforcement. From 2013 to 2019, <a href="https://icct.nl/publication/trends-return-and-prosecution-isis-foreign-terrorist-fighters-united-states" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an estimated 53,000 fighters from 80 countries</a> traveled to ISIS-held territories in Syria and Iraq to be a part of what the group sold as an idealized Islamic state. An estimated <a href="https://icct.nl/publication/trends-return-and-prosecution-isis-foreign-terrorist-fighters-united-states" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">300 individuals from the United States</a> either made their way to ISIS-held territory or tried to. Some foreign fighters became notorious for perpetrating the caliphate’s worst atrocities.</p><p>For sympathizers unable to make the journey, ISIS’s chief spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, called for supporters around the world to attack nonbelievers at home. In a September 2014 speech, Mr. al-Adnani <a href="https://jihadwatch.org/2014/09/islamic-state-we-will-conquer-your-rome-break-your-crosses-and-enslave-your-women-by-the-permission-of-allah" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that if you are unable to bomb or shoot the enemy disbeliever, “smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car.” ISIS sympathizers began undertaking such vehicle attacks, including a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-france-prisons-paris-nice-f95c0d8162ef04ab8bebad610675516a" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">truck assault in Nice, France,</a> in 2016 that killed 86 people and injured 450. It was followed by <a href="https://www.counterextremism.com/vehicles-as-weapons-of-terror" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many others</a>.</p><p>In the last few hours before his suicidal rampage in New Orleans, the attacker, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, posted about his plans on Facebook. Perhaps the most telling recording was his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/04/us/new-orleans-attack-shamsud-din-jabbar-isis.html" title="">confession</a> that he had considered harming his family. “I don’t want you to think I spared you willingly,” he said. But Mr. Jabbar apparently worried that if he hurt only his family, news headlines might not focus on the “war between the believers and disbelievers” that he thought was taking place.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>In my work, I have found that self-recruited, lone-actor terrorists are often motivated at least as much by personal grievance as their claimed ideals. In one recent study, many former violent extremists <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2023.2204668" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that underlying social and emotional distress was as strong a factor in their radicalization as intellectual or religious adherence to extremist ideologies. Most reported having a history of mental health problems, such as depression, and suicidal ideation was common.</p><p>Obviously, most people experiencing a mental-health crisis do not become lone-actor terrorists. But there is often so much distress in individuals carrying out attacks on their own that it is reasonable, in my view, to think of lone-actor terrorism as a crime of despair.</p><p>There is no single pathway into violent extremism, but many of the risk factors I’ve observed in my research seem to apply to Mr. Jabbar. He was a veteran who appeared to be having difficulty adjusting back to civilian life. He had been divorced for the third time. He had run-ins with the law. He may have been deeply distressed over his financial burdens. Revenge against his family — and a world that had disappointed him — appears to have been a significant part of his underlying motivation, with his allegiance to ISIS providing a perverse spiritual gloss.</p><p>The persistent appeal of ISIS in America was evident in a disturbing series of alleged plots in the last year alone: the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/afghan-national-arrested-plotting-election-day-terrorist-attack-name-isis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrest</a> of an Afghan in Oklahoma accused of conspiring to commit an attack on Election Day; the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/islamist-terror-incidents-targeting-us-increase-2024" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrest</a> of an Arizona teenager accused of planning an attack on a Pride parade using a remote-controlled drone armed with explosives; the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/houston-man-charged-attempting-provide-material-support-isis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">indictment</a> of a Houston man on charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS; and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/idaho-man-arrested-attempting-provide-material-support-isis" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrest</a> of an Idaho teenager accused of plotting to attack churches on behalf of ISIS. In December, the F.B.I., the National Counterterrorism Center and Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://file-us.clickdimensions.com/ghaorg-atxic/files/dhsjib12-12-24.pdf?m=12/11/2024%202:47:54%20PM&amp;_cldee=q_D8M9RkXI9UnmPC9UWkYDCRxveya0nJZBm4TFFsS5LggO2TrCafqFnqAO0u6YtT&amp;recipientid=contact-bde2af16561bee118f6e000d3a314599-11f261968445467b88d4ee8fdb1cc0d2&amp;esid=4319e9b3-bab8-ef11-b8e9-6045bd072f48" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> law enforcement that pro-ISIS messages were calling for attacks at large holiday gatherings, pointing out the previous use of vehicles to ram victims.</p><p>Years after its zenith, ISIS has demonstrated remarkable adaptability. As an organization, it may yet grow stronger. After its territorial defeat in 2019, stated U.S. military strategy shifted its focus from counterterrorism in the Middle East toward nation-state adversaries, notably China and Russia. But the underlying conditions that first enabled ISIS’s rise in the region persist: Weak states, unstable governments, large populations of underemployed youth, and religious and ethnic conflicts all continue to create fertile ground for extremism.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>No single solution exists for preventing terrorist attacks. But actions can be taken to reduce their impact, as well as their frequency. For cases like New Orleans, prevention is critical.</p><p>Perpetrators of targeted violence often “leak” their intentions ahead of time to family, friends, social media and even to the authorities, creating the opportunity for communities to step in to help people who are at risk. One approach to preventing violence like the attack in New Orleans <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/a-view-from-the-ct-foxhole-william-braniff-director-center-for-prevention-programs-and-partnerships-u-s-department-of-homeland-security/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">builds on public-health models</a> that aim to reduce the rates of suicide, domestic violence and drunken driving. For it to prevent terrorist attacks, the authorities have to educate the public about the importance of bystander reporting and “<a href="https://securitypolicylaw.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Building_Off_Ramps_Meeting_Summary_0617.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">off ramps</a>” from violent radicalization.</p><p>The New Orleans attack serves as a grim reminder that the ISIS digital caliphate is still able to transform personal crises into public tragedy. The alarming reality is that many other people remain vulnerable to similar paths of radicalization.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
