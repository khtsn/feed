Trump has promised to unravel President Biden’s major legislation when he takes office next month, but Mr. Biden is hoping to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/us/politics/biden-election-legacy.html" title="">salvage his most prized policies</a> with help from an unlikely source: Republicans.</p><p>With just weeks left in office, Mr. Biden and his aides have emphasized that his signature economic legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, overwhelmingly benefits Republican districts, in the hopes that Mr. Trump would face blowback from his own party if he repealed it.</p><p>The administration is also racing to award <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/climate/biden-environmental-groups-climate-policies-trump.html" title="">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in grants and finalize environmental regulations to lock in Mr. Biden’s economic agenda, including ramping up domestic manufacturing of clean energy products and semiconductors.</p><p>“They are not going to want to undermine those jobs and those businesses that we know for the first time are really strong in so many districts around the country that have been left behind under trickle-down policies,” Lael Brainard, Mr. Biden’s national economic adviser, said in an interview.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Roughly 80 percent of new clean energy manufacturing investments announced since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022 have flowed to Republican congressional districts, according to data from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm.</p><p>Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked the legislation, which provides at least $390 billion over 10 years in tax breaks, grants and subsidies for wind and solar power, electric vehicle battery production and other clean energy projects.</p><p>Mr. Trump, who has called global warming a “scam,” wants to claw back money included in the law, which some estimates have found could <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost as much as $1.2 trillion</a> over 10 years.</p><p>“We will rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Mr. Trump said in September.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also attacked the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law aimed at reducing American reliance on Asia for semiconductors by providing billions in subsidies to encourage companies to manufacture more chips in the United States.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>He called it a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/trump-joe-rogan-chips-science-act.html" title="">bad” deal</a> that “put up billions of dollars for rich companies.”</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Some Republicans are joining the White House’s effort in pressing Republican leaders to preserve aspects of Mr. Biden’s policies. In states like Georgia, which has been a big beneficiary of Mr. Biden’s climate law, some of Mr. Trump’s supporters expressed concern about how potential rollbacks of the law could result in job losses and hurt companies that have made new investments in battery, solar and electric vehicle plants across the state.</p><p>Beth Camp, a Republican state representative who supports Mr. Trump, said she worried that the president-elect’s plan to repeal much of the climate law could be “detrimental” and leave factories “sitting empty” in Georgia.</p><p>“I would hate to see that suddenly get pulled without looking at it very intently and very closely to see the economic impact to those communities,” said Ms. Camp, who represents the Concord area.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>It could be politically difficult for Republicans to unravel Mr. Biden’s economic policies. In a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson this summer, <a href="https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/FINAL%20Credits%20Letter%202024.08.06.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">18 House Republicans wrote</a> that prematurely peeling back the energy tax credits, which have “created good jobs in many parts of the country,” could undermine private investments. One of the Republicans who signed became Mr. Trump’s pick for the secretary of labor, Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>“It’s not just our belief that it’s working,” said Natalie Quillian, a White House deputy chief of staff who has taken the lead on enacting Mr. Biden’s policy agenda. “I think you see some evidence of that just in elected officials who have walked back prior statements, who have adjusted their strongly held beliefs that things should be repealed.”</p><p>“The political will is shifting as we watch it,” Ms. Quillian added. “We see the benefits throughout communities.”</p><p>The Biden administration is limited in what it can do to shield its policies from Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump will be able to reverse many of Mr. Biden’s executive actions. For legislation, federal law will restrict the new administration’s ability to block funds that have already been appropriated by Congress. But with Republicans in control of both the Senate and House, Mr. Trump could halt some of the spending by passing measures that would scale back the funding in Mr. Biden’s legislation.</p><p>Ms. Quillian also acknowledged that while White House officials are emphasizing getting money out to states, they cannot significantly speed up the distribution.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“I don’t think there is a new option to implement differently or faster that makes these investments more enduring,” Ms. Quillian said.</p><p>Rather, the White House is focused on showing how the investments have benefited Republicans with the hope that Mr. Trump’s own party will persuade him to use restraint.</p><p>When Mr. Johnson said last month that Republicans may try to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act, which includes $39 billion in subsidies that Mr. Biden has said will revamp American semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on China, other Republicans immediately clarified that the party supported the investments. Mr. Johnson later walked back his statement.</p><p>Mr. Johnson has also said he planned to “use a scalpel” and not a “sledgehammer” on the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who runs the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, said he thought some clean energy tax credits were all but certain to be repealed, such as the $7,500 tax break that consumers can claim to offset the cost of an electric vehicle. But he said it was too simple to assume that the Inflation Reduction Act would be repealed entirely, given that much of the funding was heading to red districts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“I expect this to be a pretty elaborate dance as they figure out what can go entirely, what they want to scale back and what’s going to remain untouched,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.</p><p>Michael Linden, a former economic aide to Mr. Biden who is now a senior policy fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth think tank, also said he did not think the law would go “necessarily unscathed.” He also pointed to the tax credits for electric vehicles as well as billions in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/us/politics/irs-tax-report-congress.html" title="">new funding</a> for the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on wealthy tax evaders.</p><p>But he said it would be politically and economically unwise for Republicans to repeal the law, given that it is spurring investment in communities that have been “sorely overlooked” for decades.</p><p>Kasey Carpenter, a Republican state representative in Georgia, said he was also concerned about how the loss of a major piece of Mr. Biden’s agenda would affect the local economy. Although Mr. Carpenter said he was open to some repeals, he worried that changes to the law’s tax credits could reduce demand for products like solar panels, which could negatively affect clean energy manufacturers that have recently expanded in his district.</p><p>“So much money has been spent building these facilities,” said Mr. Carpenter, who represents the Dalton area. “The last thing you want to do is get it all built, and then jobs disappear.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><section id="styln-guide" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="styln-guide-title"><hr/><h2 id="styln-guide-title">Trump Transition: News and Analysis</h2><hr/><ul><li><p><strong>Targeting the N.I.H.:</strong> The National Institutes of Health has been called “the crown jewel of the federal government.” But when President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans take charge, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/health/nih-trump-kennedy-bhattacharya.html">the agency may face a reckoning</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support for Patel:</strong> Several Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/trump-kash-patel-fbi-republicans.html">fell in line</a> behind Trump’s plan to choose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/us/politics/kash-patel.html">Kash Patel</a> to lead the F.B.I., defending the president-elect’s right to install a loyalist who has vowed to exact revenge on Trump’s adversaries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roles for In-Laws:</strong> Trump tapped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/trump-massad-boulos-middle-east.html">Massad Boulos</a>, the father-in-law of his daughter Tiffany, as a senior adviser covering Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.
