    <h1>Game Time in Philadelphia: Vote Looms for New 76ers Arena Near Chinatown</h1>

But critics, citing a litany of misguided stadium deals around the country, warn the arena <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/30/us/philadelphia-chinatown-76ers-arena.html" title="">would decimate</a> the city’s storied but fragile Chinatown.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The last hearing on the project is scheduled for Tuesday, and a vote is <a href="https://www.phillytrib.com/news/local_news/phillys-city-council-to-add-session-on-dec-19/article_8fce96d2-674e-532f-a595-a7373c26c0c8.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected by Dec. 19</a>. If a majority of the 17-member Council says yes, as many anticipate, then the project would be in the hands of Mayor Cherelle Parker, who has been a strong supporter and who would be approving a signature accomplishment in her first year in office.</p></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00nat-philly-arena-04-fmcv/00nat-philly-arena-04-fmcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00nat-philly-arena-04-fmcv/00nat-philly-arena-04-fmcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/11/27/multimedia/00nat-philly-arena-04-fmcv/00nat-philly-arena-04-fmcv-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="People wearing red T-shirts that read “No Arena” shout in protest.

The Wells Fargo Center, off Interstate 95, is part of a <a href="https://www.visitphilly.com/areas/south-philadelphia-sports-complex/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sports and entertainment hub</a>, where the Eagles and Phillies also play.

And while that sense of urgency is a common negotiation tactic, the team says it will look to move elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/nyregion/new-jersey-philadelphia-76ers.html" title="">including New Jersey</a>, if the project stalls.</p><p><a href="https://www.nba.com/news/sixers-announce-plans-to-build-new-1-3-billion-arena-by-2031" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">First proposed</a> in July 2022, the <a href="https://76place.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">76 Place</a> project, featuring an 18,500-seat arena, would create more than 9,000 jobs, and help transform the dreary Market East neighborhood between the city’s convention center and its historic district, according to the developers.</p><p>The Sixers haven’t ruled out seeking state or federal money, though they note that they are not asking for city money — “an approach that is <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20240925171254/Arena-Agreement-Public-Meeting-Presentation.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unprecedented among our local sports facilities</a>,” according to the mayor’s office.

Those unions helped propel Ms. Parker and Kenyatta Johnson, the City Council president, to their current positions, and have long supported Councilman Mark Squilla, who represents the district where the arena would be built.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Critics of the arena warn that it would decimate the city’s storied but fragile Chinatown.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-16"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Deborah Wei, the co-founder of the community group Asian Americans United, was removed by sheriff’s deputies during a City Council meeting in October.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“It means an economic opportunity plan, quite frankly, the likes of which have never been seen in our city,” <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/mayor-parker-supports-76er-arena-center-city-chinatown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ms. Parker said in September</a>.</p><p>Still, the city’s own <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/philadelphia/76ers-arena-impact-study-takeaways-20240828.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assessments</a> noted that while the arena would be “appropriate” for Center City, it posed a “significant potential risk” to Chinatown by displacing residents and hurting small businesses.</p><p>The city also estimated that the project would generate about $700 million in tax revenue — less than the $1 billion<strong> </strong>that the Sixers had claimed.</p><p>The opposition has been relentless. <a href="https://billypenn.com/2024/09/12/photos-thousands-march-save-chinatown-coalition-to-protest-76ers-arena/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thousands of people have attended numerous rallies</a> wearing T-shirts with “No Arena in Chinatown” and criticizing the team’s billionaire owners.
