Storms had caused widespread damage in the state, in particular in the city of Rolla, state emergency officials <a href="https://x.com/MoSEMA_/status/1900758703218868653" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said late Friday night</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Tornado warnings were in effect into Saturday in many parts of Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee, according to the Weather Service.</p><p>By around 5 a.m. Eastern time, power outages had spread to more than 156,000 customers in Missouri, about 69,000 in Illinois, close to 50,000 in Indiana and around 24,000 in Arkansas, according to PowerOutage.us, a tracking website.</p><p>These storms are all connected to the intense system wreaking havoc across the Central United States, which over the past day has brought tornadoes across the Midwest and dust storms and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/wildfires-texas-oklahoma.html" title="">wildfires</a> to the Plains.</p><p>Saturday’s storms are forecast to move extremely fast and may catch people off guard. They have the potential to form numerous significant tornadoes, some of which could be potentially violent, damaging hurricane-force (greater than 74 miles per hour) winds and golf-ball- or even baseball-size hail.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>According to the Storm Prediction Center, Saturday is likely to be the third time in history that the center has issued a high-risk warning on the second day of a storm. Central Mississippi and Alabama face the highest risk level, 5, in the center’s rating system. The Gulf Coast states and Georgia face a high risk level of 4 on Saturday.</p><p>Storms at this highest level of alert can often produce intense long-track tornadoes, meaning they stay on the ground for a very long time. A slow storm will typically only affect one or two communities, but a faster-moving storm such as this one can cross multiple states, leaving a long trail of damage.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><p>Tornadoes typically occur across the South from the middle of March until late April, when the risk shifts to the Plains.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>The threat of severe weather is expected to continue into the weekend, as the front pushes eastward.</p><p>The storm is expected to move offshore on Monday.</p><p>Hank Sanders<!-- --> and <!-- -->Qasim Nauman<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Judson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times who forecasts and covers extreme weather.<span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/judson-jones">More about Judson Jones</a></span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
