</span> 3-0 to claim their second-straight GCC trophy.</p>

<p>The best-of-five series played itself out on three maps on Pearl, Sunset, and Haven. Shopify Rebellion picked Pearl and Haven, while MIBR picked Sunset and Abyss. Having entered this match from the upper bracket, Shopify Rebellion had the double map ban, and chose to avoid Split and Bind. Shopify Rebellion won Pearl 13-7, Sunset 13-7, and Haven 13-11 while Abyss and Ascent, MIBR&#39;s second pick and the decider, were unnecessary.</p>

</span> roster, Shopify Rebellion has won their second international championship with the same core.</p>

<p>Beginning on the attack side of Pearl, MIBR had the opportunity to set the tempo on not just the map, but the series. Duelist <span data-ref-id="3">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/17976/florescent">
		florescent	</a>
</span> threw the first punch of the series though, racking up seven kills in the first two rounds by way of her Sheriff and her Outlaw to collect ultimate points early.</p>


<p><em>Three shots, four kills for florescent.</em></p>

<p>Shopify Rebellion&#39;s double-Initiator team composition offered them plenty of information on the large two-site map, offering an entertaining clash with the double-Controller composition of MIBR. On a map as large as Pearl which requires so much time to rotate, SR carried the advantage heading into the second half. Moments of heroics from <span data-ref-id="4">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/3079/alexis">
		alexis	</a>
</span> pushed them to map point, and SR wrapped things up two rounds later.</p>


<p><em>A huge 3K for SR alexis to cap off a retake and reach map point.</em></p>

<p>Shifting to Sunset, Shopify Rebellion rode their momentum from Pearl. Now beginning on the attack side, the key to the map appeared to be doing what they were good at. florescent ended the map with a 24-kill performance. Ten of those kills were first-bloods for the entry frag.</p>

<p>After switching sides and losing the pistol, anti-eco, and bonus rounds, MIBR threatened to snowball their way into a comeback. They cut a six-round halftime lead in half and carried five rifles into the next round, but walked their way into a SR-shaped trap.</p>


<p><em>Four shots, three kills this time for florescent.</em></p>

<p>The rest of Sunset was smooth sailing for Shopify Rebellion. They never trailed in the map after dropping the first two rounds of the map, and would build on their 9-3 halftime lead to go up 2-0.</p>

<p>The third map of the series, Haven, was a map that MIBR was yet to play at GCC, while Shopify Rebellion has played it twice before. After winning the pistol and anti-eco rounds with relative ease, MIBR dropped their bonus round, but bounced back to claim a 3-1 lead. With momentum building, SR seemed to have a clear read on their opponents and put a stop to that run, claiming a round thanks to an impressive show of mechanics from Sentinel player <span data-ref-id="5">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/17397/noia">
		Noia	</a>
</span>.</p>


<p><em>MIBR play their ways into a Noia ace.</em></p>

<p>Down five rounds to three with their opponents carrying a healthy economy into the next round, MIBR forced SR head coach <span data-ref-id="6">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/65/effys">
		effys	</a>
</span> to call a timeout to regroup his team. Whatever was said in the timeout appeared to have worked, as Shopify won two of the next four rounds to grab five in the defense half of a generally attack-sided map.</p>

<p>After ending the first halves of the first two maps with 9-3 leads, SR had ground to make up on Haven, facing a 7-5 deficit once the teams switched sides.</p>

<p>Victories in the pistol and anti-eco rounds quickly returned the map to a deadlock, and while they did drop the bonus, they entered it with a flourishing economy. After razor-thin margins between the teams kept them tied or within two rounds of each other for the rest of the second half, they continued to build a strong economy. </p>

<p>A hero buy Vandal from MIBR duelist <span data-ref-id="7">
	<a href="https://www.hltv.org/player/31574/srn">
		srN	</a>
</span> was not enough to stop the bleeding in the 22nd round, and SR found series point. While MIBR would claw one back, it was goodnight from Berlin soon after.</p>


<p><em>A florescent 4K to end GCC 24. Storybook ending?</em></p>

<p>Shopify Rebellion lifts not just their second-straight Game Changers Championship trophy, but their second straight in <strong>dominant</strong> fashion. In last year&#39;s competition, they did so without dropping just three maps. They outdid themselves in this year&#39;s competition, not dropping a single map and capping another unbeaten GCC campaign.</p>

<p>Superstar duelist florescent dropped 74 kills and an ACS of 317, both server-highs while MIBR duelist srN had a team-high 44.</p>

<p>Florescent won the GCC MVP award unanimously, earning 100 percent of the votes in the process.</p>

<p>“I&#39;m happy, it looks nice,” florescent said after receiving the bracelet awarded for earning the accolade.</p>

<p>“I thought I&#39;d just play ranked for the rest of my life, so this is pretty nice,” she said.</p>

<p>Shortly after, she spoke to the mic, drawing “oohs” from the Berlin crowd.</p>

<p>“I just want to play against the best of the best always cause it&#39;s the most fun,” she said, teasing the possibility of playing outside of Game Changers in the near future. When asked what her dream in professional Valorant was, she responded: “I don&#39;t know, probably just like, go to Champs and go to a bunch of events and meet a bunch of cool people.”</p>

<p>“I&#39;m honestly incredibly proud,” effys said after the match. “Not just now but the entire past few months, I just think everybody&#39;s just gone on they&#39;ve played between like eight and 12 hours and not complained at all. So yeah, right now I&#39;m proud. Win or lose I would have been proud regardless.”</p>
