		<p>Gen.G has defeated TALON 2-0 in the Pacific Kickoff lower bracket. They will next play against T1, as the teams look to reach the grand final and qualify to Masters: Bangkok. TALON is now eliminated from the tournament, leaving only South Korean organizations in the top three. </p>

<p>The match began on Bind, TALON&#39;s map pick, which Gen.G won with a comfortable 13-7. Gen.G&#39;s preferred map of the event, Lotus, continued the series, with a dominant 13-2 ending the series.</p>

<p>Not counting Last Chance Qualifiers, this victory marks Gen.G&#39;s fourth consecutive VCT Pacific medal, a streak that began when their Masters-winning roster won Kickoff 2024. </p>
