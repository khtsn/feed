    <h1>‘Conclave’ Streaming Numbers Jump After Pope Francis’ Death</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Released in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20215234/?ref_=mv_close" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">October 2024</a> and based on Robert Harris’s 2016 thriller of the same title, “Conclave,” which <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">won an Academy Award</a> for best adapted screenplay, follows a fictionalized papal election process (and all of the palace intrigue) after the death of a pope. Contenders are played by Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow, among others. Secrets emerge and tensions flare as the competition field narrows.</p><p>The papal election process depicted in “Conclave” is fairly accurate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/world/europe/pope-francis-conclave-film.html" title="">according to experts</a>. The film’s depictions of different ritual acts, including how cardinals count votes by reading paper ballots aloud, weaving them along a single thread and then burning them, are “more or less correct,” said Piotr H. Kosicki, an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland.</p><p>But in <a href="https://cardinalseansblog.org/2025/03/07/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remarks on his blog</a>, Cardinal Seán O’Malley, the former Archbishop of Boston, said that the 2013 conclave he participated in when Pope Francis was elected was a “much different experience than what they depicted in the movie.”</p><p>“For all its artistic and entertainment value,” he said, “I don’t think the movie is a good portrayal of the spiritual reality of what a conclave is.” Netflix’s “The Two Popes,” a biographical drama about Pope Francis and his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, also saw a growing audience, with Luminate reporting a 417 percent increase in viewership. According to Luminate, the 2019 film had 290,000 minutes watched on Sunday compared with 1.5 million minutes watched on Monday.</p></div></div>
