By 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 16 hours after Mr. Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, had begun railing against President Trump’s policies on the floor of the U.S. Senate, roughly 14,000 callers had left messages on his office hotline, aides said. Before he finally stopped speaking, the office had fielded 14,000 more.</p></div></div><div data-testid="AudioBlock-1"><figure><figcaption><div><h3>What goes into making a 25-hour speech?</h3><p><span>Senator Cory Booker’s staff worked furiously for a week to put together 1,164 pages of prepared material that he could draw upon.</span></p></div></figcaption><div></div></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>For 25 hours and five minutes, Mr. Booker, who will turn 56 this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/booker-senate-trump.html" title="">did not sit or exit the Senate chambers</a> to eat or use a bathroom. His speech broke, by nearly an hour, a record set 68 years ago by Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a segregationist who at the time was trying to block civil rights legislation.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>Americans noticed. The social-media-savvy senator streamed the speech live on his TikTok account, where it garnered more than 350 million “likes.” And more than 110,000 people were watching on YouTube when Mr. Booker ended his speech in much the same way he began: with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stFxmjUy5Y8" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">homage to a mentor</a>, the civil rights pioneer John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who spent three decades in Congress.</p><p>“Let’s get in good trouble,” he said, borrowing Mr. Lewis’s famous call to action.</p></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-5"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><div><div><div><div aria-labelledby="modal-title" role="region"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Cory Booker Delivers Marathon Speech on Senate Floor</h2><h4>Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, spoke for more than 25 hours, criticizing the Trump administration’s policies on Social Security, education, health care and more.</h4></div><dl><dt></dt><dd><p>“The Senator from New Jersey.” “I just want to tell you what John Lewis said. It’s a quote so many people know. He said, “get in good trouble, necessary trouble.” So tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble. I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able. In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for — from our highest offices, a sense of common decency. This is a moral moment. It’s not left to right. It’s right or wrong. Let’s get in good trouble.

Still, in polls and on social media, many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/democratic-voters-party-fight-gop.html" title="">frustrated Democratic voters have been agitating</a> for them to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/democrats-trump.html" title="">try to do more</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“The Democrats have been acting like it’s OK what Trump is doing, and it’s not OK,” said Angel Leston, 38, who owns the Casa d’Paco restaurant in Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, where Mr. Booker was mayor before being elected to the Senate.</p><p>“Now,” he added, “there’s finally some fire.”</p><p>Vivian Cox Fraser, president of the Urban League of Essex County, based in Newark, said she found herself tuning in to Mr. Booker’s speech at several points on Monday and Tuesday, encouraged by his passion.</p><p>“Somehow you have to demonstrate opposition,” she said.</p><p>“The one thing I hope is, it will be the impetus for a lot more — for us to stand up,” said Ms. Cox Fraser, who expressed concern that any cuts to education funding, social services or Medicaid would hurt the families her organization serves.</p><p>Ryan Haygood, a New Jersey civil rights lawyer, said he found Mr. Booker’s willingness to put “his full self into it” inspirational. “We need voices everywhere, on every level, fighting for the foundation and soul of this country,” said Mr. Haygood, who leads the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.</p><p>“Thank you, Cory, for your commitment to protecting the values our country was built on,” Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey wrote on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>But even some who supported Mr. Booker’s approach said they recognized that it risked angering a president who controls the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/doge-musk-federal-payroll.html" title="">federal purse strings</a> and has shown an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/trump-jack-smith-law-firm-security.html" title="">appetite for revenge</a>.</p><p>“Trump is going to retaliate — 100 percent,” said Mr. Leston, whose restaurant is on a working-class, residential block in the Ironbound, a heavily Latino neighborhood where Mr. Trump drew significant support in November.</p><p>“He retaliates against anybody that says anything bad about him — what makes you think New Jersey is any different?” he said. “But that shouldn’t deter people from speaking out against his policies.”</p><p>Praise for Mr. Booker was hardly universal. At Krug’s Tavern, a Newark institution for nearly a century, most patrons Tuesday night were focused on the Yankees game, not Mr. Booker, when he officially broke Mr. Thurmond’s record at 7:19 p.m.</p><p>“The Democrats can’t come to grips with the fact that they lost,” one customer, Paul Wiener, 69, said as the grill sizzled nearby. “The work should have been done before the election, not after the election.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>“Booker is just one more mosquito in the swamp,” he added.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Trump, Harrison Fields, dismissed the speech with a mocking reference to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/nyregion/cory-booker-new-jersey.html" title="">comment</a> Mr. Booker made during the Senate confirmation hearings for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who now sits on the Supreme Court: “When will he realize he’s not Spartacus — he’s a spoof?”</p><p>Still, some other political opponents offered Mr. Booker ungrudging props.</p><p>“Regardless of politics, Cory is an impressive man with a good heart, lots of energy and a high-octane intellect,” said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who ran former Gov. Chris Christie’s campaigns.</p><p>“You don’t have to agree with him on every policy to be proud that so many people in the country were watching the former mayor of Newark make history.”</p><p>Mr. Booker’s oratorical marathon covered plenty of turf, serious and less so.</p><p>He spent the bulk of the time discussing granular policy positions and detailing his concerns about cutting funding for education, health care and medical research. He told poignant stories about his family’s experience with redlining, his father’s struggle with Parkinson’s disease and the effects the Trump administration’s policies were having on his constituents.</p><p>“This is a moral moment,” he said repeatedly.</p><p>But he also filled some of the time in other ways. He waxed poetic about M&amp;M candies — first produced, he noted, in Newark. He resurfaced jocular grudges from his days playing football at Stanford University. And he tackled an abiding New York sports riddle.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>“The Giants and the Jets play in New Jersey,” he said. “There’s only one football team in New York, and that’s the Bills.”</p><p>Even after Mr. Booker left the chamber, he wasn’t quite done for the day. He spoke briefly to Washington reporters at the Capitol, then appeared on two televised national news shows before finally taking a break to eat, aides said.</p><p>He started fasting on Friday night and stopped drinking water on Sunday as he prepared to spend a day without a bathroom break.</p><p>Staff members said they fielded persistent questions throughout the day about whether he was relying on a catheter or an adult diaper. On Wednesday, an aide said he used neither.</p><p>Mark Bonamo<!-- --> contributed reporting.
